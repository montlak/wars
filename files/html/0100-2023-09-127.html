Dept. of Transp</span>., 114 MSPR 155, 160-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2010 MSPB 106 (2010), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> DA-1221-11-0224-B-1 (NP 6/18/2103):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his PFR as noted above, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge's dismissal of his appeal for lack of jurisdiction may have been a dismissal for mootness on the basis that the agency rescinded the Written Admonishment before the appellant filed his appeal. To the extent that the administrative judge considered the appeal to be moot on that basis, he erred. Where an agency cancels an action after the appellant files a request for corrective action with OSC, but prior to the filing of his IRA appeal, that cancellation does not necessarily divest the Board of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 316, &#x00B6; 15 (2006); <span class="Italic">Lachenmyer v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 7 (2002); <span class="Italic">Schlosser,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 24. The record reflects that the agency rescinded the Written Admonishment pursuant to a settlement agreement signed by both the appellant and the agency. However, that agreement expressly states that it "does not constitute a waiver of any right guaranteed by law, rule, regulation or contract on behalf of either Party." Thus, the appellant did not thereby consent to divest the Board of jurisdiction over his whistleblower claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant argues that the agency has not completely rescinded the Written Admonishment. He argues that, although his immediate supervisor told him, when she issued it, that it would "stay" with her, she provided a copy to Labor Relations personnel, and there is no proof that the Labor Relations office purged the Written Admonishment and related documents from its records after it was rescinded. The appellant further argues that he never received notice that his personnel or performance file had been corrected or amended. And, he questions how, if the Written Admonishment was rescinded and destroyed, the agency was able to provide a copy of it in the file it submitted to the Board. These allegations constitute a nonfrivolous claim that the agency has not, as it asserts, completely rescinded the Written Admonishment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 1, 3 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has further held that, even when the agency has completely rescinded the action at issue in an IRA appeal, the appeal is not moot if the appellant has outstanding, viable claims for consequential damages or corrective action. <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 401, 403-04 (1998). In his OSC complaint, the appellant requested the imposition of disciplinary action against his immediate supervisor for her part in this matter. He made a similar request in his appeal, and he has renewed the request in his PFR. In addition, he has stated that, if he prevails, he will seek consequential damages. The Board may order both consequential damages and disciplinary actions as a result of an action brought by OSC at the request of an employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(g)(2), 1215(a)(3). Moreover, the Board may refer matters raised in an IRA appeal to OSC for further investigation, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(f)(3), and it may order "any...reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages" in its decision on such an appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). Therefore, even if the agency completely rescinded the Written Admonishment, the appellant's outstanding claim for consequential damages and other corrective action would preclude the dismissal of his appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Newcastle v. Department of Treasury,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (a request to impose discipline on an agency official can preclude dismissing an IRA appeal as moot); <span class="Italic">Walton,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 403-04 (in light of the appellant's claim for consequential damages, and for corrective action in the form of an attorney fee award and discipline against any official who may have retaliated against her, her IRA appeal was not moot).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Walton,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> a claim for consequential damages for whistleblowing reprisal may avoid mootness of an appeal that leads to restoration of the employee and back pay, as <span class="Italic">Samble v. DOD</span>, 98 MSPR 502, 508 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2005), an IRA case involving reversal of a separation for lack of due process, demonstrated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversal of the agency's action, however, does not provide the appellant with all of the relief to which he might be entitled. The Board's reversal of the action based on the agency's failure to provide the appellant with minimum due process entitles the appellant to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief that includes: cancellation of the action; the appellant's reinstatement to his former position or other substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Forrest v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 213, 224 (1997). However, under the 1994 amendments to the WPA, an appellant who prevails on an allegation of reprisal for protected whistleblowing is entitled to relief in addition to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. Such an appellant is also entitled to medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 401, 403-04 (1998) (the agency's rescission of a personnel action that was the subject of an employee's IRA appeal did not render the appeal moot where the employee had outstanding claims for consequential damages and corrective action in the form of discipline against any official who might have retaliated against her).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because reversal of the appellant's separation did not provide him with all of the relief to which he may be entitled if he prevails on his reprisal claim, we find that his reprisal claim is not moot and he is entitled to an adjudication of his reprisal claim in accordance with the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. Accordingly, we remand this appeal for a hearing on the merits of the appellant's affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hagen v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 103 MSPR 595, 601 &#x00B6; 15, 2006 MSPB 310 (2006), also determined an AJ improperly dismissed as moot an IRA case based upon the possibility of recovery of consequential damages as well as a request to impose discipline on an agency official by an appellant who received a reprimand prior to his retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the AJ erred to the extent that he dismissed the appeal as moot. As the appellant asserts, the AJ should have afforded him a specific opportunity to raise a claim for consequential damages and sufficient notice to address the issue before dismissing the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Santos v. Department of Energy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 475, &#x00B6; 7 (2005);<span class="Italic"> Durr v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 283, &#x00B6; 11 (2005);<span class="Italic"> Newcastle v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2003). The AJ did not do so, and the record does not show that the appellant's attorney was aware of the need to raise such a claim. Granted, because the appellant has retired and therefore is no longer a Federal employee, the Board is unable to return him to the<span class="Italic"> status quo ante</span> with regard to the personnel actions raised in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Wood</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 15. But the Board has found that a request for consequential damages may include such things as restoration of annual leave used to avoid part of a detail, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, attorney fees, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Santos</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 475, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Samble v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). Furthermore, a request to impose discipline on an agency official also may preclude dismissing an IRA appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Newcastle</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lachenmyer v. FEC</span>, 92 MSPR 80, 84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 10 (2002) (although concerns that a reprimand removed from personnel records might resurface did not avoid the mootness of an IRA case, the case was not moot when the appellant had claims for consequential damages in the form of counsel fees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A detail ultimately terminated, but viable at the onset of appellant's OSC IRA complaint, coupled with a claim for consequential damages, sufficed to avoid dismissal of the appeal as moot, <span class="Italic">Porter v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 606, 609-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying the appellant's request for corrective action, the administrative judge found that, because her detail was terminated when she transferred to Los Angeles, there was no corrective action the Board could order and the issues concerning the detail were rendered moot. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The fact that, while her complaint was pending, she was able to "extricate[&#8197;] " herself from the detail, the very action of which she complained...does not mean that it never occurred. <span class="Italic">See Frazier v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 672 F.2d 150, 161 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (the fact that subsequent events, the employees' resignations, made the originally requested form of relief, rescission of their transfers, inappropriate did not render their appeals moot). Thus, just because the appellant was able to voluntarily remove herself from the perceived harassment does not, in and of itself, render moot or otherwise cure any prior retaliatory action by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we agree with the administrative judge's finding that, because the appellant's detail was terminated, "there is no corrective action that the Board could order." On the contrary, in cases where it finds reprisal based on whistleblowing, the Board is statutorily authorized to order broad relief, that is, such corrective action "as [it] considers appropriate." 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)<span id="Page_1050"></span>(1). In addition to the traditional <span class="Italic">status quo</span> remedies, section 1221(g)(1) (i) and (ii), the law provides that the Board may order the payment of medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). Pursuant to section 1221(g)(1)(B), corrective action shall include attorney fees and costs. The Board shall also refer a matter to the Special Counsel if it determines that there is reason to believe that a current employee may have committed a prohibited personnel practice. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(f)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that a detail, unlike a demotion or a suspension, is not "facially stigmatizing," <span class="Italic">see Hoever v. Department of the Navy,</span> 70 MSPR 386, 389 (1996), and that the appellant has not asked that the record of her detail be deleted from her personnel record. As such, the remedies of placing her, as nearly as possible, in the position she would have been in had the prohibited personnel (1996), and that the appellant has not asked that the record of her detail be deleted from her personnel record. As such, the remedies of placing her, as nearly as possible, in the position she would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred, and of providing her back pay and benefits, may not be applicable. However, consequential damages, and the payment of attorney fees' and costs, remain viable forms of corrective action in this case. As to the former, we note the appellant's assertion that her request for transfer and attendant damages were related to the alleged retaliatory detail. If so, then, arguably, damages for such would be considered foreseeable and payment could be ordered by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department</span> of Transportation, 71 MSPR 661, 664 (1996).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board's jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action against a particular appellant at the time an appeal is filed with the Board, and an agency's unilateral modification of its action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divestiture, or unless the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed<span class="Italic">.

In <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 291-92, which was decided in 1990, the Board held that the agency's cancellation of a written reprimand and a five-day suspension rendered those actions moot and thereby removed the appellant's IRA appeals from the Board's jurisdiction. The Board held that, "[w]ere the appellant left in a worse position as a result of the cancellation than he would have been in if the matter were adjudicated, his argument might have greater force" and concluded that, "[b]y its complete cancellation of the actions, the agency has afforded the appellant relief equivalent to that which he could have received from the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 292. In <span class="Italic">Weber</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 85-86, a 1993 decision that relied upon <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, the Board held that the agency's cancellation of certain actions rendered the appellant's IRA appeals moot because "there would be no further relief that we could grant the appellant even if we found his allegations of reprisal substantiated."

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act, however, an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonably foreseeable consequential damages. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">see Walton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1996, the Board held in a case involving alleged discrimination that, when an appellant has outstanding, viable claims for compensatory damages before the Board, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford him all of the relief available before the Board and therefore does not render the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 197 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Walton</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 403-04, the Board applied the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Currier</span> to outstanding, viable claims for consequential damages and corrective action in IRA appeals. Thus, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Walton</span> that an IRA appeal is not rendered moot when the agency completely rescinds the personnel action at issue if the appellant still has outstanding claims for consequential damages, as well as claims for corrective action in the form of attorney fees and discipline against an official who may have retaliated against her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 404. The Board held that the appeal is not moot under these circumstances because the appellant has a statutory right to pursue such consequential damages and corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Church of Scientology of California v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1051"></span>Here, the administrative judge erroneously found that there was no corrective action that the Board could order regarding the ODAP and that the appeal was moot. The appellant has consistently asserted that Corby-Leonard's alleged retaliation damaged his career. In his complaint to the OSC, he asked that OSC "assist in ensuring that [he] be made whole for the damage to my career." In response to the administrative judge's show-cause order, he reiterated that he raised the issue of the "economic impact" of the alleged retaliation before the OSC. Further, he contended that he would have been promoted automatically if the Board cancelled the ODAP and that the effect of the failure to promote continues to harm his current earnings. The appellant made his assertion that he would have been promoted automatically in a letter that he sent to the OSC after OSC had issued him a notice of right to seek corrective action from the Board. The statement may not have been relevant to the OSC proceedings because OSC had closed the appellant's case; however, the appellant submitted the letter into the record of his Board appeal and it became relevant evidence that the administrative judge should have weighed in adjudicating the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertions of economic damage due to being given the ODAP, particularly his assertions that being given the ODAP delayed his completing the certification process and that the labor-management agreement applicable to him mandated that controllers be promoted to the full performance level after they completed the certification process, are assertions that he was left in a worse position because of the cancellation than he would have been in if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed. Thus, we find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that his successful completion of the ODAP did not render his IRA appeal moot because the agency did not place him, as nearly as possible, in the position that he would have occupied had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred. Additionally, consequential damages remain a viable form of corrective action here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that the appellant's IRA appeal was not rendered moot simply because the agency terminated the ODAP and that the administrative judge improperly dismissed his case without affording him the opportunity for adjudication of the merits of his claim or even the opportunity to make a limited evidentiary showing on damages. Accordingly, we remand this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant resigned after filing his OSC complaint. We find that the administrative judge properly found that the appellant failed to show that his resignation was involuntary and affirm the administrative judge's dismissal of that claim. As a result, since the appellant is no longer a federal employee, the Board is unable to return him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> with regard to the agency's action of changing his duties and responsibilities and reassigning him. Thus, the issue arises as to whether the appeal may be dismissed as moot. However, although the administrative judge issued an order to show cause on jurisdiction, he did not inform the appellant that he could claim an entitlement to any non-<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, even though the appellant specifically requested in his complaint to OSC that the agency's Comptroller Department be audited and that Hurley be sanctioned for his actions.

<p class="Body-Text">An employee may file an IRA appeal and later be removed for subsequent misconduct that is sustained by the Board. If the preexisting IRA case involves matters causing no loss of pay, the IRA case may be mooted by the removal because the Board can provide no meaningful relief for the WPA violations. In <span class="Italic">Occhipinti v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 504, 507-08 (1994) (not involving a claim for damages), a removal based on a criminal conduct led to mootness of a whistleblower appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mootness occurs either when issues are no longer "live" or where the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> 6A MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE R 57.13<span class="Italic">. See also Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 670-71 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[a] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As detailed below, the appellant's removal appeal is moot because there is no longer a live case or controversy. More particularly, his IRA appeal is moot because the Board cannot grant him meaningful or significant relief, and he, thus, lacks a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to present a live case or controversy, there must be a live case or controversy at the time that a case is decided, not merely at the time the complaint is filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spectronics Corp. v. H.B. Fuller Co., Inc.</span>, 940 F.2d 631, 635 (Fed. Cir.).... The appellant's removal appeal was a live matter when it was originally filed. As discussed above, however, the appellant's appeal was eventually dismissed without prejudice to his timely refiling, and he has not refiled it. Thus, there is no present case or controversy involving the appellant's removal pending before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that, if he could obtain a reversal of his conviction, then he could be reinstated, there would again be a case or controversy, and he could obtain relief. We agree. The appellant is at liberty to file a new appeal at any time. Should the appellant obtain reversal of his conviction, and should he desire to do so, he is free to submit an appeal to the Board's New York Regional Office in an effort to seek reinstatement if the agency declines to reinstate him. That matter, however, would represent a new <span id="Page_1052"></span>appeal and a new case or controversy. The administrative judge would be free to resolve the matters presented in that new appeal, including questions of timeliness and/or jurisdiction. At this time, however, there is no case or controversy pending in connection with the appellant's removal, and the Board cannot reverse the removal action taken by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his IRA appeal, the appellant claims that, in retaliation for his protected disclosures, the agency threatened to alter or eliminate the ASU, and that it eventually reorganized the Unit and reassigned him. Even assuming, without deciding, that the appellant's claims are true and that the Board has IRA jurisdiction over them as "personnel actions," we can discern no meaningful corrective relief that we can accord the appellant because he is no longer an employee of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant could obtain correction of paperwork involving a reorganization and a reassignment. Because the appellant is no longer an employee, however, the Board cannot order him reassigned to his former position. Further, there is no showing of any monetary loss to the appellant and no showing of other relief that he could obtain. The appellant, therefore, would gain nothing significant or meaningful from an adjudication of his IRA appeal and he, thus, has no legally cognizable interest in the outcome of this appeal. In <span class="Italic">White v. International Boundary Water Commission</span>, 59 MSPR 62, 65 (1993), the Board found that, because it could not order the appellant's return to the agency's rolls, the only relief it could award was a declaration that the appellant was temporarily treated improperly. The Board concluded in <span class="Italic">White</span> that such relief was not "effective relief' and therefore mooted the appeal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here, the only relief the Board could grant would be on paper and such relief is not meaningful or effective. As one court has succinctly put it, "[w]hen events during the pendency of the appeal have eliminated any possibility that the court's order may grant meaningful relief affecting the controversy...dismissal of the appeal [is appropriate]." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alton &#x0026; Southern Ry. Co. v. International Ass'n of Machinists &#x0026; Aerospace Workers</span>, 463 F.2d 872, 877-78 (D.C. Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We shall, accordingly, dismiss this appeal as moot.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeJesus v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3290) (if the position sought through reassignment is eliminated by a RIF, or if the appellant is so disabled that he could not accept a position, his IRA appeal is moot for lack of effective relief that could be obtained through the appeal (not involving damages)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When mootness becomes an issue in an IRA appeal, the AJ should inform the appellant of the range of remedies that may be available to avoid dismissal of the case. In <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 101 MSPR 238, 240-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, 2006 MSPB 39 (2006), the employee resigned after he initiated an IRA case based upon a reassignment to unclassified duties. Although the IRA case did not include the resignation, there were still some possible remedies that the AJ should have explained to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief that includes: cancellation of the retaliatory personnel action; the appellant's reinstatement to his former position or to another substantially equivalent position, as appropriate; back pay; interest on back pay; and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Forrest v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 213, 224 (1997). Additionally, under the 1994 amendments to the WPA, an appellant who prevails on an allegation of reprisal for protected whistleblowing is entitled to relief in addition to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief. Such an appellant is entitled to medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonably foreseeable consequential damages. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 401, 403 (1998). Furthermore, an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal may also request that disciplinary action be imposed against agency officials who have engaged in the retaliatory conduct. <span class="Italic">Newcastle v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 8 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant resigned after filing his OSC complaint. As a result, since the appellant is no longer a Federal employee, the Board is unable to return him to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> with regard to the agency's action of detailing of him to unclassified duties. However, although the AJ issued an order to show cause and provided the appellant with an opportunity to identify some meaningful remedy for the agency's allegedly retaliatory detail, he did not inform the appellant that he could claim an entitlement to any non-<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, even though the appellant specifically asked the AJ to advise him of his rights. Under similar circumstances, we have found that before dismissing an IRA appeal as moot, the AJ should afford the appellant a specific opportunity to raise a claim for consequential damages and he should provide the appellant with sufficient notice to address the issue. <span class="Italic">See Lachenmyer v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 10 (2002). Therefore, because the appellant's resignation did not foreclose all of the possible relief to which he may be entitled if he prevails on his WPA claim, we find the AJ erred by essentially dismissing the appeal as moot based on the current record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the <span class="Italic">Walton</span> decision in 1998, the Board dismissed appeals as moot that included whistleblowing claims if the underlying personnel action was truly canceled and if there was no apparent other viable claim for relief. The Board considered the extent that cancelation of actions deprive it of jurisdiction under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act in <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289, 291-92 (1990). A written reprimand and a five-day suspension, rescinded by the agency following the appeal, were challenged because the appellant felt that the remedy was not complete. He wanted, among other things, a transfer and a continuing stay preventing the agency from taking any personnel action against him until a full evidentiary hearing was held before the Board. The Board declined continuing jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held, in cases arising under its appellate jurisdiction, that an agency's rescission actions, such as occurred here, results in returning the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, and that the Board is thereby divested of jurisdiction over the appeals where the agency completely rescinds the action or the appellant consents to less....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the same result should obtain here. The Act is remedial legislation, intended to improve protections for Federal employees, and should be construed to effectuate that purpose....&#8197;Moreover, there is legislative language that lends some support to appellant's position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Section 16, "Change in Whistleblowing Prohibited Personnel Practice," Joint Explanatory Statement, 135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989), 135 Cong. Rec. S2784 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 1989) ("[m]ere harassment and threats, without any formally proposed personnel action, can constitute a prohibited personnel practice.") Nothing else in the legislative history or in the language of the Act itself, though, supports a finding that the cancelled actions, absent more, provide a sufficient basis for the Board's jurisdiction under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Were the appellant left in a worse position as a result of the cancellation than he would have been in if the matter were adjudicated, his argument might have greater force. That is not the result of our decision, though. By its complete cancellation of the actions, the agency has afforded the appellant relief equivalent to that which he could have received from the Board. Arguments that, because the appellant sought the fuller relief stated above, his appeal should not be dismissed, are misguided. There is nothing to stay. A stay simply "orders the agency to suspend the complained of personnel action...." Here, the action was not simply stayed, but cancelled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred in dismissing his appeals because he was seeking ongoing whistleblowing protection from agency retaliation against him in the future. However, with the exception of the now-cancelled reprimand and suspension actions, the appellant has presented no evidence of a prohibited personnel practice. The Board has said that where, as here, an appellant's allegations are so lacking in specificity that they cannot serve to invoke the Board's jurisdiction under the Act, they neither prevent the appeal from being moot nor provide an additional basis for appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298, 302 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 83, 86 (1993), explained that under <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, if the appellant initiated an IRA appeal concerning a proposed removal and the agency then canceled the removal and issued a proposal and decision to suspend the appellant, the appeal from the proposed removal was moot because there was "no further relief that we could grant the appellant even if we found his allegations of reprisal substantiated." The Board added that "an agency is not precluded from rescinding a proposed action and substituting another action in its place." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Walton</span>, a speculative claim for consequential damages was insufficient to sustain an IRA appeal from a detail that was terminated before the appellant's hearing, <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 386, 387-89 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective August 22, 1994, the appellant was detailed from his Crane Operator Foreman position in the Public Works Department to a "Resume of Duties" position in the Supply Department. On August 26, 1994, he filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that he was detailed due to his whistleblowing activities....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the doctrine of mootness applies to IRA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 54 MSPR 406, 410 (1992); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298, 301-02 (1990); <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289, 291 (1990). Under this doctrine, an appeal will be dismissed as moot if the appellant obtained all the relief he would have obtained had he prevailed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mascarenas v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 60 MSPR 320, 323 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The testimony of the appellant and an agency official during the August 30, 1995 hearing confirms that the appellant was returned to his Crane Operator Foreman duties "[a] month" before the hearing. Because the record thus shows that the appellant's detail has ended, we must examine whether the matter of the detail is moot. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mascarenas</span>, 60 <span id="Page_1053"></span>MSPR at 323 (where the agency terminated the appellant's detail and returned him to his former duties, the matter of the detail was rendered moot); <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 54 MSPR at 411 (where a detail ended, there was nothing to be "undone" by the Board, so that the matter was moot); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">also White v. International Boundary &#x0026; Water Commission</span>, 59 MSPR 62, 65 (1993) (where the appellant was removed a second time after he was reassigned, the matter of the reassignment was moot because the Board could not grant effective relief).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g) (effective Oct. 29, 1994), the Board may award, as part of its corrective action in an IRA appeal, "reasonable and foreseeable consequential" damages[2] including "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, [and] travel expenses...." The appellant, who was represented by an attorney below, requested that the AJ award "consequential damages." The only type of consequential damages to which he even alluded, however, were medical costs. He testified during the hearing that, "[r]ight after the detail started, [he] went to [his] physician" and obtained medications for various conditions. Although the AJ did not preclude him from testifying further or submitting documentary evidence regarding medical costs, he did not do so. There is simply no record evidence showing how any medical costs were incurred because of the detail and, if so, the amount incurred, much less a showing that the costs were "reasonable and foreseeable." 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(g), 1221(g). Thus, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the Board decided to "order[&#8197;] corrective action" here, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g), the corrective action would not include such speculative, unproven consequential damages. We therefore find that the appellant's vague and unsupported claim for consequential damages is insufficient for the Board to fashion a remedy and, thus, does not preclude the dismissal of this appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Taylor</span>, 54 MSPR at 412.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The statutory provision refers to consequential "changes," but it is apparent that consequential "damages" were intended. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(g); Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 8, 108 Stat. 4364-65 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the appellant has not asked that the record of his detail be deleted from his personnel record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 54 MSPR at 411. Unlike facially stigmatizing actions such as a demotion or a suspension, a detail in general and the detail here in particular is facially neutral. Thus, the mere fact that the record of the detail was not deleted from the appellant's personnel records does not, without more, preclude the Board's dismissal of this appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See generally Mascarenas</span>, 60 MSPR at 323; <span class="Italic">White</span>, 59 MSPR at 65; <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 54 MSPR at 411. Under these circumstances, we find that the matter of the appellant's detail is moot. We therefore find it unnecessary to address the appellant's evidence and arguments on petition for review regarding the propriety of the detail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit provided guidance as to actions threatened by agencies and canceled following an IRA appeal. The issue is whether, following cancelation of the threatened action, there is a reasonable likelihood that the threat may reoccur. <span class="Italic">Kagel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 126 F.3d 1455, 1458-59 (Fed. Cir. 1997), involved a threat by the agency to require the employee to resign, or be removed, from his position if his wife did not discontinue business activities considered by the agency to create an appearance of a conflict of interest. To avoid discipline, Kagel's wife suspended the business activities, but Kagel also took his case to the Board. The agency argued that since the conflict was resolved, the appeal was moot. The court disagreed, resolving that the threat would again occur if the wife resumed her business activities and, given the potential for future problems of the same nature that generated the appeal, the case was not moot:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may dismiss an appeal as moot if the appealable action is canceled or rescinded by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Cooper v. Department of the Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The agency's rescission of the appealable action, however, must be complete in order for the appeal to be deemed moot and to relieve the Board of its statutory obligation to decide the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Bruning v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 834 F.2d 1019, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing Kagel's IRA appeal as moot, the administrative judge concluded that "the threat of removal made to [Kagel] in the August 10, 1995, letter has been eliminated and that there is no effective remedy which the Board could provide in regard to his employment status." The administrative judge based that conclusion on the premise that Kagel, "in concert with his wife, chose to contest the August 10 letter-directive by her ceasing employment and seeking relief from a court for the allegedly improper agency action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kagel argues that the administrative judge erred by dismissing his appeal as moot. The terms of the August 10, 1995, directive from the Corps, Kagel contends, make clear that the agency will remove Kagel if his wife resumes her business activities in the Walla Walla District. The government responds that the agency's threat of removal "will recur only <span class="Italic">if</span> Mrs. Kagel decides to resume her...business activities within the Walla Walla District," and that such a possibility does not amount to a "reasonable expectation or likelihood" that the agency would threaten Kagel with removal again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Kagel that Nancy Kagel's temporary cessation of her business activities within the Walla Walla District did not moot Kagel's IRA appeal. The agency has not withdrawn the August 10, 1995, directive or represented that its position, as set forth in that directive, has changed. In addition, according to the administrative judge's findings, the agency "rebuffed" efforts by Kagel's counsel to resolve the dispute informally. Those actions indicate that the agency will likely take the same position with respect to Kagel's employment if his wife returns to her former employment. The threat to remove Kagel if his wife resumes her business thus remains live. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Honig v. Doe</span>, 484 U.S. 305, 318-22, 108 S. Ct. 592, 601-03, 98 L. Ed.2d 686 (1988); <span class="Italic">Vitek v. Jones</span> 445 U.S. 480, 486-87, 100 S. Ct. 1254, 1260-61, 63 L. Ed.2d 552 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the Kagels chose to comply with what the administrative judge labeled the "choices" in the August 10, 1995, directive when Nancy Kagel ceased her business activities in order to eliminate the threat of removal to Kagel. In his August 25, 1995, letter, however, Kagel's counsel advised the agency that Nancy Kagel was discontinuing her business activities within the Walla Walla District "pending a resolution of this matter in the administrative courts or in other courts." That statement indicates that Nancy Kagel's cessation of her business activities in the Walla Walla District is only temporary and that she intends to resume those activities when her husband's situation is resolved. It is unreasonable to conclude that her temporary cessation of work pending resolution of Kagel's appeal is a sufficient ground to avoid resolving Kagel's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government points out that in the event Nancy Kagel resumes her business activities and the agency again threatens Kagel with removal, Kagel can appeal that threat to the Board again. While that is true, it does not further the government's argument. If the agency once again threatened Kagel with removal and his wife again agreed to refrain from doing business in the district until the matter was resolved, the Board presumably would dismiss Kagel's appeal for mootness once again. Thus, what the government is arguing amounts to saying that in order for Kagel to obtain review of his appeal, Nancy Kagel must remain in her business following a threat of removal, and Kagel must allow the agency to remove him. But that position would have the effect of denying Kagel the right to appeal a threatened removal, despite the fact that a threatened removal constitutes an appealable action under the Whistleblower Protection Act....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Bosley v. MSPB</span>, 162 F.3d 665, 669 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (noting the broad remedial powers of Board in an IRA case, the court was reluctant to dismiss an IRA appeal as moot when the possibility existed that the appellant could make out a case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The initiation of paperwork, apparently a SF-52, to terminate an appellant's position, was insufficient to sustain IRA jurisdiction when the agency decided not to process the requested personnel action, <span class="Italic">Shires v. DOD</span>, 60 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the portion of the IRA appeal pertaining to the agency's preparation of the form SF-50 as moot, the administrative judge relied upon the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298 (1990). In these cases, the Board concluded that it would follow its holdings under pre-Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) appellate jurisdiction cases, that an agency's rescission of an action divested the Board of jurisdiction over an appeal. <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, at 291; <span class="Italic">Godfrey</span>, at 302. In doing so, the Board rejected the appellants' assertions that rescission did not provide them with a complete remedy because they sought discipline for agency officials who retaliated against them. <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, at 291-92; <span class="Italic">Godfrey</span>, at 301-02.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these cases, the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency's decision not to process the SF-52 rendered the IRA appeal of this matter moot. Further, the appellant's assertion that she has not received a complete remedy is unavailing for the same reasons discussed in <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>. There, the Board found that neither the language of the WPA, nor its legislative history, supported a finding that the cancelled actions, absent more, provided a sufficient basis for Board jurisdiction under the circumstances presented in those cases. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span>, we find that there would be no further relief that we could grant the appellant even if we found her allegations of reprisal substantiated. We therefore conclude that the administrative judge correctly dismissed this portion of the IRA appeal as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that both <span class="Italic">Mulherin</span> and <span class="Italic">Godfrey</span> involve personnel actions that were effected, rather than just threatened. Although threatened actions may, arguably, not be cancelled in the same sense that effected actions are cancelled, it is illogical for the Board to adjudicate an appeal of a threatened action after the threat has been withdrawn, even though it would not have adjudicated the appeal if the agency had effected the action before cancelling it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 643 (1991), involved a threatened step increase denial. Apparently the threat was withdrawn. The underlying IRA action was moot. That the appellant was then placed on a PIP for unsatisfactory performance <span id="Page_1054"></span>constituted only the "lawful acts required by an employee's less than fully satisfactory performance evaluation" and did "not demonstrate retaliation for whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, 51 MSPR at 645. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Sirgo v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 261, 267 (1995) (threat to terminate a probationer was within the scope of the IRA; the probationer's resignation did not moot the appeal, for there at least remained the possibility that the appellant could prevail upon the Board to direct abatement of the threat); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DHUD</span>, 64 MSPR 314, 319 (1994) (IRA: finding that a performance improvement plan may involve a threatened personnel action). Under <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that the appellant did not receive a WIGI did not support a finding of retaliation. The appellant's complaint concerned a threat. Once the threatening actions were rescinded, there was "nothing left for the Board to 'undo'"; the appeal was properly dismissed. Also commenting on "lawful actions," the Board concluded that by requesting an audit of an appellant's pay records, the agency did not take or threaten a personnel action or decision concerning the employee's pay or benefits. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 50 MSPR 474, 475 (1991) (IRA: considering whether an audit of the appellant's personnel records was a threatened personnel action under the WPA); <span class="Italic">Gergick v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 657 (1990) (IRA: considering the elements of a threatened action under the WPA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mootness of an IRA appeal was also considered in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 54 MSPR 406, 410-12 (1992), concluding that appellant's concerns about his performance appraisal, documentation concerning a detail, and promotion potential, were too speculative to keep the case alive:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, in an IRA appeal, as in any other appealable matter, the agency's cancellation of the appealed action renders the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mulherin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 289, 291-92 (1990); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 45 MSPR 298, 301-02 (1990). In these cases, the Board examined the records and concluded that the appeals were mooted because the employees had been returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and were not left in a worse position as a result of the cancellations than they would have been in if the matters were adjudicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant argues that he was left in a worse position because of the cancellation. Specifically, he contends that he was denied the opportunity to compete for a promotion, was forced to use a large amount of sick leave, was not immediately returned to his position of record following cancellation of the directed reassignment, and was denied a performance evaluation. The agency did not respond to these allegations, except to state that they were not in any way connected to the reassignment. Nor did the administrative judge address the allegations....&#8197;We have reopened the case to address these issues. In doing so, we consider whether the appellant would have had any greater entitlement by virtue of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief he would have received if his appeal had been adjudicated in his favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the appellant's claim with respect to the alleged denial of an opportunity to compete for a promotion is not a basis for concluding that he was left in a worse position. If we were to find merit to the appellant's claim in this regard, we would thereby expand the concept of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as it now exists in analogous situations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Slake v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 207, 215-16 (1992) (the Board did not have jurisdiction over the appellant's claim in an IRA appeal that he was denied an opportunity to compete for a promotion, where the agency cancelled the vacancy announcement for the position). Even where an adverse action is reversed by the Board, an appellant is entitled to a promotion in a compliance proceeding only where some provision of law mandates it or he establishes that he would, in fact, have been promoted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390 (Fed. Cir. 1986). No such showing has been made here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant argues that he was not immediately returned to his position of record following cancellation of the directed reassignment. The argument he makes here with respect to his detail to another position from the date of the cancellation until August 16, 1990, would be declared moot in a traditional compliance case, because the Board could not legally order compliance under these facts, inasmuch as the appellant was eventually restored to his former position. He has not requested that the record of his detail be deleted from his Official Personnel Folder--an action over which the Board would retain jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 517, 519-20, <span class="Italic">appeal after remand</span>, 45 MSPR 401 (1990) (Table). Rather, he claims that the detail was further evidence of reprisal. Since the detail has already ended, however, there is nothing which can be "undone" by the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we find that the appellant's allegation concerning his failure to receive a performance appraisal is too remote from the action at issue here. Specifically, he claims that he was denied a performance appraisal for the year 1989-1990. The cancellation of the action has not left the appellant any worse off than he would have been with respect to his performance appraisal. Had the Board adjudicated the appellant's reassignment and found in his favor, and if the Board had received a petition for enforcement on this issue, we would not have found the agency in noncompliance because it failed to execute a performance appraisal. That failure would properly be seen as having nothing whatsoever to do with the cancellation of the geographic reassignment and thus the Board would not view it as affecting the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. Therefore, the cancellation of the action has not left the appellant any worse off than he would have been with respect to his performance appraisal had we adjudicated his appeal. Hence, the Board is without authority to order the agency to give the appellant a performance appraisal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 37 MSPR 230, 232-33 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant alleges that he was forced to use a large amount of sick leave during the period of time he was reassigned. His arguments in this regard, however, are too speculative as a basis for the Board to retain jurisdiction or to fashion a remedy. The appellant presented no evidence to support this allegation (for example, there is no statement from his treating physician that the appellant was capable of working part time during his convalescence). Moreover, we believe that there is an inherent contradiction in the appellant's current claim that he could have worked had he not been reassigned and his applications for sick leave during this period. Sick leave may be granted to an ill employee only where he certifies that he is incapacitated for the performance of his duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 630.301(b) [now 5 CFR 630.401(a)(2)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the agency's cancellation of the reassignment mooted the appeal and that it was properly dismissed.</p>
