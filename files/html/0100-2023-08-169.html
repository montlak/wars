<p class="Block-Quote2">In consultation with the employees of the Administration and such non-governmental experts in personnel management systems as he may employ, and notwithstanding the provisions of title 5 and other Federal personnel laws, the Administrator shall develop and implement, not later than January 1, 1996, a personnel management system for the Administration that addresses the unique demands on the agency's workforce. Such a new system shall, at a minimum, provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicability of title 5</span>.--The provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system developed and implemented pursuant to paragraph (1), with the exception of--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals to merit systems protection board.</span>--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under the new personnel management system developed and implemented under paragraph (1), an employee of the Administration may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, retroactive to April 1, 1996, the Board shall have the same remedial authority over such employee appeals that it had as of March 31, 1996.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Right To Contest Adverse Personnel Actions</span>.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee of the Federal Aviation Administration who is the subject of a major adverse personnel action may contest the action either through any contractual grievance procedure that is applicable to the employee as a member of the collective bargaining unit or through the Administration's internal process relating to review of major adverse personnel actions of the Administration, known as Guaranteed Fair Treatment, or under section 40122(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Election of Forum</span>.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a major adverse personnel action may be contested through more than one of the indicated forums (such as the contractual grievance procedure, the Federal Aviation Administration's internal process, or that of the Merit Systems Protection Board), an employee must elect the forum through which the matter will be contested. Nothing in this section is intended to allow an employee to contest an action through more than one forum unless otherwise allowed by law.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this section, the term "major adverse personnel action" means a suspension of more than 14 days, a reduction in pay or grade, a removal for conduct or performance, a nondisciplinary removal, a furlough of 30 days or less (but not including placement in a nonpay status as the result of a lapse of appropriations or an enactment by Congress), or a reduction in force action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brock v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211214148">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), construed the statute and its election of remedies provisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA has its own personnel management system and procedures for appealing adverse personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122. Section 40122 provides that FAA employees may contest adverse personnel actions (e.g., removal decisions) through the FAA's internal GFT appeal process or by filing an appeal with the Board (among other options). See &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), (h), (j). The statute further provides that "an employee must elect the forum through which the matter will be contested. Nothing in this section is intended to allow an employee to contest an action through more than one forum unless otherwise allowed by law." &#x00A7; 40122(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 18, 2020, Mr. Brock sent an e-mail to the FAA, electing to proceed with the GFT appeal process. A little over a week later, on May 26, 2020, Ms. Natalie Frazier--a labor and employee relations specialist at the FAA--reached out to Mr. Brock to inform him that the GFT arbitrator pool needed to be replenished and that the FAA was waiting on resumes for potential arbitrators to hear Mr. Brock's appeal. Mr. Brock responded to Ms. Frazier's e-mail on May 28, 2020 (ten days after he sent the FAA an e-mail electing the GFT appeal process), stating: "Since the Southern Region FAA GFT forum will not meet the timeframe to provide a designated pool of arbitrators, I have chose[n the] MSPB venue instead." Mr. Brock filed his appeal with the Board that same day. Ms. Frazier responded the next day (eleven days after Mr. Brock elected to proceed with the GFT appeal process, which was after the allotted time in the FAA Manual for selection of arbitrators), informing Mr. Brock that the resumes for potential arbitrators had been received and further stating: "If you intend to proceed with your GFT appeal, the arbitrator selection for your Tri-Party Panel can now commence. If however you have elected to file an appeal with the MSPB, as indicated in your email below, your GFT appeal will be closed." Mr. Brock responded the same day, asking Ms. Frazier to "please close the GFT appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 27, 2020, the Department of Transportation (DOT) moved to dismiss Mr. Brock's MSPB appeal, arguing that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Brock first filed a GFT appeal, thus precluding his appeal before the Board. An Administrative Judge agreed with the DOT and, in an initial decision, dismissed Mr. Brock's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Brock v. Dep't of Transp</span>., No. AT-0752-20-0542-I-1, 2020 WL 4439058 (M.S.P.B. July 31, 2020). The Administrative Judge found it was "undisputed" that Mr. Brock elected and filed a GFT appeal prior to filing an appeal with the Board, and that his election of the GFT procedure "was both knowing and informed." The Administrative Judge further held that there is "no law, rule, or regulation providing for Board jurisdiction when an appellant abandons their elected forum." This initial decision became the final decision of the Board when Mr. Brock did not petition the full Board for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Mr. Brock chose to proceed with the GFT appeal process, withdrew that appeal, and then filed an appeal with the Board. Mr. Brock argues, however, that his decision to proceed with the GFT appeal process was not knowing and informed and is therefore not binding. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The principle underlying the Board's dismissal is that Mr. Brock cannot proceed with an appeal before the Board because he first chose to proceed with the GFT appeal process. While we have not yet addressed this issue under the statutory scheme at issue in this case (&#x00A7; 40122(i)), in analogous situations related to the Title 5 appeal process (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121), we have held that "[o]nce a timely filing is made to pursue a path [in one specified forum], the other is forever waived." <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 804 F.2d 673, 675 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We have cautioned, however, that "[i]n order to comply with the statute, the agency must properly inform an employee of [their] choices." <span class="Italic">Atanus v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 434 F.3d 1324, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The agency must "clearly express[ ] to [the employee] that [they] had two options, and that one would exclude the other." Id. (emphasis added). In the notice provided to the employee in Atanus, the agency stated in plain language that a "choice of one of the procedures excludes the use of the other." App'x to Resp. Br. at RA-24, <span class="Italic">Atanus v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., No. 05-3123 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 11, 2005). That notice clearly informed the employee that proceeding with one choice "exclude[d] the use of the other." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we held that the employee's choice to file a grievance precluded a later appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Atanus</span>, 434 F.3d at 1326-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, Mr. Brock's decision was not knowing and informed because the FAA failed to let him know that the GFT appeal option was non-functional. Mr. Brock only learned after he chose the arbitration path that the FAA lacked the necessary arbitrators for the proceeding. He promptly withdrew his request and filed a timely appeal with the Board. He had not started to arbitrate and no deadlines had passed. These facts distinguish Mr. Brock's case from situations such as that in <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, where the employee had elected a grievance procedure, prosecuted it through multiple steps, and then attempted to appeal the dismissal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that the statute itself is not clear for the circumstances Mr. Brock was facing. After stating that the employee "must elect the forum through which the matter will be contested," &#x00A7; 40122(i) concludes by stating that "[n]othing in this section is intended to allow an employee to contest an action through more than one forum <span class="Italic">unless otherwise allowed by law." Id</span>. (emphasis added). This language differs from the statute in <span class="Italic">Atanus</span> (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1)), which states that an aggrieved employee may raise a matter by filing an appeal with the Board or the negotiated grievance procedure, "but not both." Thus, unlike the statute in <span class="Italic">Atanus</span>, which specifically states that an employee may not choose to proceed in both forums, &#x00A7; 40122(i) leaves open the possibility that proceeding in both forums in the way that Mr. Brock did here (e.g., by withdrawing one before proceeding with the other) may be permissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the notice Mr. Brock received, Mr. Brock's communications with FAA personnel, and the statutory language, we conclude that the Board's finding that Mr. Brock's decision to initiate the GFT appeal was knowing and informed is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred in finding that Mr. Brock's decision to proceed with the GFT appeal was knowing and informed. We therefore reverse the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result of the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies <span id="Page_277"></span>Appropriations Act (the DOT Act), Board appeal rights for FAA employees were eliminated effective April 1, 1996. <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). In 2000, Congress passed the Ford Act, which restored to FAA employees the Board appeal rights they had as of March 31, 1996. <span class="Italic">Giove v. Department of Transportation</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 560, &#x00B6; 9 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 50 F. App'x 421 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Miller v.

Effective February 14, 2012, the Ford Act provision codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) was amended. <span class="Italic">See Hankins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 7. However, nothing in the Ford Act or its amendment provides that all FAA employees are within the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)-(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, determining that the Board lacked authority to review the discharge of Mr. De Santis during his probationary period, <span class="Italic">De Santis v. MSPB</span>, 826 F.3d 1369, 1370-76 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Aviation Administration hired Frank De Santis in 2013. The FAA fired him less than one month later, while he was still in his probationary period. As now relevant, he appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 210.101, 315.805, and 315.806, that have at all times relevant to this case applied only to employees in the competitive service. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Mr. De Santis was in the excepted service, not in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">De Santis v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 2014 WL 5422590, *2 (MSPB Oct. 10, 2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Board has jurisdiction to hear Mr. De Santis's appeal turns on the meaning of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), which authorizes FAA employees to appeal certain actions to the Board. In 1996, Congress had stripped FAA employees of all Board appeal rights, effective April 1, 1996, but in 2000 Congress enacted section 40122(g)(3) to restore Board appeal rights. Specifically, section 40122(g)(3) allows an FAA employee to appeal "any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under that provision, we conclude, Board jurisdiction over an appeal brought by an FAA employee depends on whether, taking as a given the employee's status in the excepted service at the time of the challenged action, that employee comes within the grants of appeal rights that existed on March 31, 1996. Thus, pre-April 1996 law is applied to actual current facts. We reject the alternative reading under which the Board would disregard the actual current status of the employee and ask what status a person in that position, or a similar position, would have had on March 31, 1996, then would use that counterfactual status in applying the grants of appeals that existed on March 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 40122(g)(3) as we read it, the Board in this case was correct. Mr. De Santis, hired and fired in 2013, was undisputedly an excepted-service employee, and the regulatory appeal rights at issue, unchanged since March 31, 1996, do not apply to excepted-service employees. We therefore affirm the Board's dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act, a comprehensive system for managing the federal work force. Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>). The Civil Service Reform Act created two general classes of positions: those in the "competitive service," which are subject to the extensive provisions of Title 5, and those in the "excepted service," which are exempt from portions, but not all, of Title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102, 2103. Putting aside Senior Executive Service positions and positions involving Senate confirmation, the "competitive service" broadly includes all federal executive-branch civil-service positions other than those "specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2102(a)(1). "[T]he 'excepted service' consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2103(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before April 1996, nearly (but not) all FAA employees were within the competitive service. That changed under the 1996 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (DOT Act), which established an FAA Personnel Management System to "provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location" of FAA employees. Pub. L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347(a), 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122, <span class="Italic">see</span> Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-264, &#x00A7; 253, 110 Stat. 3213, 3237). The DOT Act, which took effect on April 1, 1996, moved FAA employees from the competitive service to the excepted service and also exempted the FAA from all but certain provisions of Title 5 that it enumerated in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). Because the basic Board jurisdictional provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a), was not among the enumerated exceptions to the default Title 5 exemption, this court soon held that FAA employees could no longer appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. MSPB</span>, 127 F.3d 1074, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress restored the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals from FAA employees in 2000 by enacting the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Ford Act). Pub. L. No. 106-181, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307(a), 308(b), 114 Stat. 61, 124-26 (2000) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)-(3)). The Senate Report stated an aim to "reinstate the statutory requirement for the FAA to adhere to merit system principles and restore the right of FAA employees to submit appeals to the [Board]." S. Rep. No. 106-9, at 36 (1999). To do so, the Ford Act added a new category to the list of exceptions (to the FAA's general Title 5 exemption) in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2): "sections 1204, 1211-1218, 1221, and 7701-7703, relating to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H). That addition reestablished the Board's jurisdiction over FAA employee appeals. A further provision added by the Ford Act then defined what appeal rights FAA employees may invoke:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee of the [FAA] may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). The specified date, March 31, 1996, was the day before the DOT Act took effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2012, Congress added a sentence to section 40122(g)(3), which states: "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, retroactive to April 1, 1996, the Board shall have the same remedial authority over such employee appeals that it had as of March 31, 1996." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), added by FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-95, &#x00A7; 611, 126 Stat. 11, 117. That language restored the Board's authority to award back pay to FAA employees under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">Compare Gallo v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 689 F.3d 1294, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Dep't of Transp</span>., No. DE-0752-10-0078-C-1, 2012 WL 3963384, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (MSPB Sept. 11, 2012), <span class="Italic">with Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 551 F.3d 1372, 1375-77 (Fed. Cir. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. De Santis joined the Federal Aviation Administration on September 29, 2013, years after Congress withdrew and then restored Board appeal rights to FAA employees. His position as an Aviation Safety Inspector was an excepted-service position, and he was not "preference eligible." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). Mr. De Santis began his service in the position with a one-year probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA removed Mr. De Santis from his position less than one month later, effective October 25, 2013, on the ground that he violated the agency's rules regarding outside employment and holding a financial interest from a prohibited source. Mr. De Santis appealed to the Board, arguing that his termination was the result of procedural error, whistleblower reprisal, and age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that Mr. De Santis may not invoke 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.805 and 315.806(c) to give it jurisdiction because those provisions apply only to employees in the competitive service. The only question before us is a legal one: whether, as Mr. De Santis and the court appointed <span class="Italic">amicus</span> contend, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) requires that Mr. De Santis be treated as a competitive-service employee for purposes of Board appeal rights because the position he occupied for a brief time in 2013 was (like most FAA positions) in the competitive service on March 31, 1996. We reject that interpretation of section 40122(g)(3), which we interpret instead to require application of pre-April 1996 appeal rights to an FAA employee based on the actual status of the employee's position at the time of the challenged action (which we will call the "current" status), not based on the status of the same position, or of some similar position, before April 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 40122(g)(3) authorizes "an employee of the [FAA]" to appeal to the Board "<span class="Italic">any action</span> that <span class="Italic">was appealable</span> to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) (emphases added). In interpreting that language for purposes of resolving the issue presented to us, we begin by noting what it cannot sensibly mean.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although the words alone might bear the meaning that an FAA employee can now appeal an action whenever that action "was appealable" by <span class="Italic">some</span> FAA employee on March 31, 1996, that interpretation makes no sense. Congress was not providing that a person employed by the FAA on March 31, 1996, who could not have appealed a particular action at that time, could suddenly take an appeal afterwards as long as any other FAA employee, even in a different position, could have done so on March 31, 1996. That would expand Board appeal rights beyond what they were on March 31, 1996, which we have already held Congress was not doing in enacting section 40122(g)(3). <span class="Italic">See Roche</span>, 596 F.3d at 1383. Mr. De Santis and <span class="Italic">amicus</span> do not argue for such an interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, they do not, and could not sensibly, argue that the appealability right of section 40122(g)(3) is personal to the <span class="Italic">individual</span> bringing an appeal. Congress was not giving appeal rights to only individuals who themselves had appeal rights on March 31, 1996. The statute is written to apply to all FAA employees, not just those who actually were employed by the FAA on March 31, 1996. Mr. De Santis himself was not employed by the FAA at that time. By now, twenty years after 1996, a large number of the FAA's current employees must have joined the agency after March 31, 1996, and before long, that will be so for all FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only sensible interpretation of section 40122(g)(3) is that the appeal <span id="Page_278"></span>rights are tied to the <span class="Italic">position</span> of the claimant. That is so even if the "any action" language, taken by itself, may refer to the agency conduct, not aspects of the position held by the claimant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 ("Actions covered" include removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade, reduction in pay, and furlough of 30 days or less); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 4303(a) ("Actions based on unacceptable performance"; "an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) (defining "personnel action"). Section 40122(g)(3) does not say that any FAA employee can now appeal any action. It says that an FAA employee can appeal "any action that <span class="Italic">was appealable</span> to the Board," and that language necessarily invokes the full set of preconditions to appeal, which commonly includes the status of the position involved in the employment action at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3 (Board catalog of appeal rights); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) (defining "employee," applicable to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d)); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.101(b) (specifying that parts 315 through 339 of the chapter apply to all competitive-service positions but not excepted-service positions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical issue, then, is whether it is the actual appealability-relevant status of the claimant's position at the time of the challenged action--excepted v. competitive service, duration, etc.--that is to be used in determining whether the action was "appealable" on March 31, 1996. The answer, we conclude, is yes. It is a straightforward and sensible reading of the statute to take the legal standards for appealability in force on March 31, 1996, and apply those standards to the claimant's actual status whenever the claim happens to arise, whether in mid-1996, mid-2016, or mid-2036. The alternative interpretation urged by Mr. De Santis and <span class="Italic">amicus</span>--in broadly treating excepted-service employees as competitive-service employees and requiring problematic job comparisons--is less sensible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The major practical difference in application between the two interpretations of section 40122(g)(3) involves recent hires. The basic adverse-action appeal rights of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) apply to an "employee," and that term is defined by reference to how recently the individual was hired.[3] Significantly for current purposes, full appeal rights attach sooner for competitive-service employees (one year) than for (non-preference-eligible) excepted-service employees (two years). <span class="Italic">See</span> note 3, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In general, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> except for some additional details that do not detract from the point being made here, section 7511 defines "employee" as: (1) an individual in the competitive service who has completed one year of service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A); (2) a preference-eligible individual in the excepted service who has completed one year of service in the same or similar position, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B); or (3) an individual in the excepted service who has completed two years of service in the same or similar position, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The longer probationary period for most excepted-service employees gives the agency a longer period for evaluation and possible firing without adverse-action review. That greater agency discretion regarding dismissal has a natural logical connection to the looser standards for hiring excepted-service employees. Hiring into the excepted services is not subject to the stricter requirements applicable to competitive-service employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(b) (requiring an individual to pass an examination to enter the competitive service); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 3361 (promotions of competitive-service employees generally depend on passing an examination). Laxer hiring standards are tied to greater firing discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reading of section 40122(g)(3) respects that logical connection implicit in Title 5. Mr. De Santis's alternative reading does not. Mr. De Santis's position would give the greater firing protection of adverse-action appeal rights to those hired under the laxer standards, by treating all or virtually all FAA employees as competitive-service employees for appeal purposes. Such enhanced competitive-service protections would apply to all FAA employees hired after March 31, 1996--all hired as excepted-service employees. That result would run counter to a structural Title 5 policy tying hiring standards and firing discretion. And we see no basis for inferring that Congress so intended when it enacted section 40122(g)(3) on April 5, 2000. Indeed, it is hardly clear that, by then, the probationary-period difference between competitive- and excepted-service employees (one versus two years) mattered for <span class="Italic">any</span> FAA employee who had been hired into the competitive service, since such hiring had stopped four years earlier, on April 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA's expectations with respect to hiring and firing its employees, and of such employees' excepted-service status determining their appeal rights, likely have settled since 2000. The Ford Act has been in place for 16 years, and the FAA and Board have treated its employees as excepted-service employees for Board-appeal purposes during that time. <span class="Italic">See Roche</span>, 596 F.3d at 1377. Indeed, in the only case we have been pointed to in which the claimant initially pressed the position Mr. De Santis now presses, the Board rejected the argument that the claimant qualified as a competitive-service employee due to section 40122(g)(3), and the claimant did not raise that argument on appeal--even though it appears that the argument, if successful, would have been result changing. <span class="Italic">See Roche</span>, 596 F.3d at 1377. The FAA's years of treating its employees as in the excepted service has likely generated expectations, concerning hiring and firing, that deserve weight in the resolution of the statutory issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. De Santis's interpretation suffers from another difficulty: the need for problematic inquiries. Under that interpretation, appeal rights would be determined not based on a straightforward identification of the current actual status of the claimant's position in the excepted- or competitive-service but based on an inquiry into what status the position would have had on March 31, 1996. That might not be a problem for a position that has not changed since 1996, but a current position within the FAA might not have existed on March 31, 1996, and in any event the duties associated with a position may change over time. The creation of new positions and changes in positions presumably will increase over time. Moreover, in 2001, Congress created a wholly new agency, the Transportation Security Administration, and declared that "section 40122 shall apply to employees of the" new agency. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n). The TSA did not exist on March 31, 1996, making it even more problematic for section 40122 to require an inquiry into the status that a person in the same status-relevant circumstances would have had on that date. Our reading of section 40122(g)(3) avoids those problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reading gives a simple role to the language "as of March 31, 1996" in the provision. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). Immediately preceding that language is "under any law, rule, or regulation." What the date does is to identify the precise body of law--the body of law in force on March 31, 1996--that determines current FAA employees' appeal rights. That frozen-in-time body of law then gets applied to an FAA employee based on current actual status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reading also is consistent with Congress's general aim of "restoring" Board appeal rights. That restoration surely was focused on the great mass of Board appeal rights generally shared by competitive- and excepted-service employees alike--including the adverse-action appeal rights that typically become available after a year or two, as well as appeal rights involving prohibited personnel practices, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a). The 1996 DOT Act had taken away all such rights from all FAA employees, and the 2000 Ford Act gave them back. The choice we must make on the narrow issue before us does not materially change the fulfillment of that purpose. We are aware of no specific legislative history suggesting a focus on circumstances where appeal rights differ for competitive- and excepted-service employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For those reasons, we think that current status is what matters for purposes of applying the March 1996 appeal-rights law. Here, Mr. De Santis was hired into an excepted-service position. His status as an excepted-service employee means that he cannot invoke 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.805 and 315.806(c) to appeal his termination because those regulations apply only to competitive-service employees. As he does not identify any laws, rules, or regulations that apply to him as a probationary excepted-service employee, the Board correctly concluded that it lacks jurisdiction to hear his appeal.</p>
