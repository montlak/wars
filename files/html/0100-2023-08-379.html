<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-371"><span class="space">b.</span> Merit Promotion With Internal Candidates Only; Reassignment; Reinstatement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3304(f)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction in the application of veterans preference between competitive examination and merit promotion selection was noted in <span class="Italic">Price v. HUD</span>, 612 Fed. Appx. 596, 597, 599 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies can use two types of selection processes to fill vacancies. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). One process is competitive examination that is open to non-agency employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In a competitive examination, the selecting official chooses from a list of qualified candidates, each given a numerical rating. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As a preferential treatment, the numerical ratings for veterans in competitive examinations are increased. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309). The other selection process is merit promotion, which is typically limited to agency employees and certain other federal employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. VEOA created a new preferential treatment for veterans to compete through the merit promotion process that would have been otherwise closed to them. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106 ("Special selection procedures for certain veterans under merit promotion."). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the veterans' rating bonus available in competitive examinations does not apply in merit promotions. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1382; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_702"></span>Under VEOA, "[a]n agency's simultaneous use of the competitive process and the merit promotion process is not of itself a violation of veterans preference." <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n</span>, 548 F.3d 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008). VEOA provides that eligible veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency...will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). We have explained that VEOA guarantees veterans "only a right to apply and an opportunity to compete" for certain merit promotion vacancies. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383. In competing for merit promotions, VEOA does not provide veterans a numerical rating bonus that may have been available in competitive examinations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. VEOA also says "nothing about the basis upon which the agency could make its selection." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing decisions concerning the impact of VEOA on merit promotion, <span class="Italic">Oram v. DOD</span>, DC-3330-17-0098-I-1 (NP 9/8/2022), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the administrative judge correctly observed, the Board has regularly held that an individual is not entitled to veterans' preference points under the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Boston v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 577, &#x00B6; 4 (2015); <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 11 (2008); <span class="Italic">see Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1380-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Veterans' preference under merit promotion procedures provides only a right to apply and an opportunity to compete in the process of selecting the best qualified candidate. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1383. It does not mandate the method by which the agency makes a selection, nor does it require any given applicant's selection. The appellant has not cited any statute or regulation regarding veterans' preference applicable to merit promotion procedures that the agency violated by failing to hire him for the position.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's additional arguments are also unavailing. The appellant argues that the agency was obligated to follow "principles of preference" in making its selection for Records Management Coordinator. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(2). He explains that the position is one of the "hybrid occupations" enumerated in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3). Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(2), he asserts, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must "apply the principles of preference for the hiring of veterans and other persons established in subchapter I of chapter 33 of title 5" for the positions enumerated in subsection 7401(3). Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(g)(1), he argues, an applicant "need only have the education[,] the experience[,] and the credentials prescribed by the Secretary to be eligible for promotion." The appellant further argues that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(c) dictates that it is the sole selection process to be used for promotions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Records Management Coordinator is a hybrid position under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7401(3), and thus subject to Title 5 competitive service veterans' preference requirements, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3); <span class="Italic">Graves v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners argue that the Board improperly interpreted 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a), by holding that veterans do not receive preference "when seeking promotions or transfers." This statutory provision reads:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a)(1) (1994). Petitioners argue that Congress intended to give veterans preference in promotions because the statute calls for the "maximum employment and job advancement opportunities."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no dispute that the granting of preference to veterans in certain aspects of public employment is an established principle of law. <span class="Italic">Crowley v. United States</span>, 208 Ct. Cl. 415, 527 F.2d 1176, 1182 (1975).

However, veterans are not accorded limitless rights and benefits. <span class="Italic">Crowley,</span> 527 F.2d at 1182. In <span class="Italic">Crowley,</span> the Court of Claims declined to accord veterans' preference under the VPA stating, "[t]here is perhaps no principle more settled in this area of the law than that promotion and non-promotion of employees within a department or agency of Government is a matter of supervisory discretion not ordinarily subject to judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1184.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts also have determined that, under the VPA, veterans' preference "does not apply to an employee's transfer or other intra-agency movement." <span class="Italic">Bates v.

We affirm the proposition established in <span class="Italic">Crowley,</span> namely, that veterans are not accorded any preference under the VPA when seeking promotion or intraagency transfers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, reliance on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a) does not salvage petitioners' argument. This statutory provision was enacted as part of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, 88 Stat. 1593 ("VEVRAA"). Congress originally enacted VEVRAA to guarantee the rights of employees called into military service to return to their old jobs, and to require certain employers to take affirmative action to provide employment opportunities for veterans of the Vietnam War era. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214. It is true that VEVRAA describes the policy of the United States as promoting veterans' "employment and job advancement opportunities within the federal government." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(a)(1). However, VEVRAA, like the VPA, accords veterans' preference only for initial employment. Congress specifically limited the preferences provided by this provision to "appointments." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1). Indeed, the agency regulations enacted pursuant to this section deal exclusively with "appointments." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 307. "The scope of veterans' preference cannot be enlarged by the fiction of treating within-agency movement as initial employment." <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, 939 F.2d at 1523.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mann's first argument is that the agency violated the VEOA by limiting the position to applicants from within the agency's own workforce. The VEOA provides in relevant part that "veterans...may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).[1] We have held that the VEOA guarantees veterans "a right to apply and an opportunity to compete" for agency vacancies that are open to applicants from outside of an agency's own workforce under merit promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">Joseph v.

But the Act does not provide veterans an opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will not accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(4) ensures that veterans will receive notice of their eligibility to compete when positions are open to applicants from outside of the agency's own workforce.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...With regard to the appellant's nonselection under merit promotion announcement 07-45, the AJ correctly observed that veterans' preference does not apply to in-service placement actions such as promotions. <span class="Italic">See Brown v.

As the appellant was not entitled to veterans' preference under this announcement, his non-selection provides no basis for relief under VEOA. With regard to vacancy announcement V117-LY-7, we note that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3327, an agency must notify the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) of competitive examinations and vacancies in the competitive service for which the agency will consider applicants from outside the Federal service, while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330 provides that agencies must notify OPM of competitive service job announcements outside the agency's own workforce. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.102, 330.707. However, even if the agency failed to provide the required notice for vacancy announcement V117-LY-7, as the appellant alleges, he is still not entitled to relief under VEOA, as none of the pertinent statutes and regulations relates to veterans' preference. Finally, absent a viable VEOA claim or other appealable action, we cannot consider the alleged prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See Davis</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 17.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant is a preference eligible who alleged that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights under VEOA by denying him a promotion after VEOA's enactment date of October 30, 1998, and that he had exhausted the DOL complaint procedure. The only remaining jurisdictional question is whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights were violated. In this inquiry, the appellant's claims of violation of his veterans' preference should be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">See Abrahamsen</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Young v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to the order to show cause, the appellant argued that the challenged promotion actions were subject to veterans' preference because the agency's vacancy announcements stated that veterans' preference would be considered in the selection. In particular, the appellant stated that the application for Maintenance Mechanic Leader asked if the applicant was in the military, cautioned that an inaccurate claim for veterans' preference could cause delay in processing the application, asked for the percentage points of preference that the veteran claimed, inquired if the preference was based on a campaign badge or expeditionary medal, and asked for the character of the veteran's discharge. Based on these assertions, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his veterans' preference rights were violated. Accordingly, the appellant met all of the jurisdictional requirements for raising a VEOA claim, and the AJ erred in dismissing this claim on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we still dismiss the appellant's VEOA claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In appraising the sufficiency of an appeal, the Board follows the accepted rule that an action should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the appellant can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. <span class="Italic">Young</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99 &#x00B6; 5. In this case, the record establishes that the vacancy announcements at issue were merit promotions, not subject to veterans' preference, and the agency has presented undisputed evidence that the reference to veterans' preference in the announcements was inapplicable, surplus language. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that veterans usually are not entitled to any preference when seeking promotions or intra-agency transfers. <span class="Italic">See Brown v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-3330-11-0126-I-1 (NP 11/16/2011), VEOA does not apply when an individual is placed into a position through reinstatement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the agency acted within its discretion by reinstating a former agency employee, who had been removed from her position as a GS-11 Internal Revenue Agent (IRA), to the GS-06 Examination Technician (ET) position at issue in this appeal pursuant to a Board mediated settlement agreement of the former IRA's removal appeal. He contends, as he did below, that the record does not establish that the former IRA's appointment to the ET position was lawful because there is no evidence that she "ever passed or was legitimately excepted from competitive examination as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(b) &#x0026; 3302(1) for appointment to federal service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this argument unpersuasive. As the administrative judge noted in the initial decision, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101 an agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any properly authorized method. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6; 11 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007). One such method is reinstatement, which is defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(15) as the "noncompetitive reemployment" of someone formerly employed in the competitive service who "had a competitive status or was serving probation when he was separated from the service." The Board has held that an agency may fill a position through reinstatement rather than competitive examination without violating VEOA. <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 10 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a), an agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously was employed under career or career-conditional appointment. At the time she was removed from her IRA position in February 2010, the individual who filled the ET position pursuant to the settlement agreement occupied a position in the competitive service under a career or career-conditional appointment, making her eligible for reinstatement. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency acted within its discretion and did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it cancelled the external announcement and appointed the former IRA to the vacant ET position pursuant to a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues on review that the former IRA was appointed to the ET position by reassignment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102, not by reinstatement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401. We need not resolve whether the former IRA's appointment was by reassignment or reinstatement, however, as reassignment is also a properly authorized method of filling a vacant position, and the Board has held that an agency does not violate VEOA when it fills a vacant position by reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) (finding no VEOA violation where an agency cancelled a certificate of eligibles and filled a vacancy by lateral transfer of an agency employee whose name did not appear on the certificate); <span class="Italic">see also Villamarzo v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (finding no VEOA violation where the agency cancelled a vacancy announcement and filled the vacant position by reassignment through a non-competitive appointment when an agency employee accepted a voluntary demotion in grade to fill the position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the appellant's apparent contention that he is entitled to corrective action because the agency failed to show that the former IRA's initial appointment to the competitive service was lawful. The propriety of the former IRA's initial appointment to the competitive service is not at issue in this appeal. As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Villamarzo</span>, the matter at issue in a VEOA appeal is not whether a particular agency action is proper and should be sustained. 92 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 5. VEOA gives the Board no authority to adjudicate the merits of any agency action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Instead, VEOA authorizes the Board to determine only whether an agency has, in connection with the action that is the subject of an appeal, violated a statutory or regulatory provision relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant has not shown that any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference prevented the agency from cancelling the vacancy announcements and filling the ET position by appointing the former IRA to the position pursuant to the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA was not violated as to an internal selection process even though the appellant was on military duty for a portion of the time that the vacancies were open, <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. DOJ</span>, DE-3330-15-0509-I-1 (NP 6/23/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's claim that he was absent on military orders during a portion of the time that the vacancy announcements were open does not establish that the agency violated the appellant's rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. As the administrative judge correctly found, although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 provides that certain categories of individuals who, due to military service, were unable to file applications for open competitive examinations during a filing period are entitled to file applications after the closing date for receipt of applications, the vacancies at issue were to be filled through a merit promotion process, rather than open competitive examination or a delegated examining process, and, therefore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 would not apply. <span class="Italic">See Grandberry v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 15 (2008) (finding that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 applies to open competitive examinations and delegated examining vacancy announcements); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312. More importantly, even if 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 were applicable, the administrative judge correctly found that it is not a regulation relating to veterans' preference because it makes no distinction between applicants with veterans' preference and those without it. <span class="Italic">See Grandberry</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 9 (finding that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 is not a regulation relating to veterans' preference); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312.</p>
