<p class="Body-Text">An unfair labor practice charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority does not divest the Board of jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 478, 482-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-20, 2007 MSPB 209 (2007) (removal reversed following remand and second review request, <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 5, 2008 MSPB 249 (2008)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that on May 31, 2006, the appellant filed a ULP charge with the FLRA indicating that she believed the agency had violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (2), and (4). In the narrative section of the form the appellant explained that: (1) On May 30, 2006, she attended a fitness-for-duty examination of a bargaining unit employee; (2) on May 30, 2006, she received a letter from the chief of the agency's Human Resources Management Service (HRMS) informing her that release of the supervisory notes to the employee was not authorized, and instructing her to return the notes by close of business on May 31, 2006; and (3) the notes were: (a) in the health records of the bargaining unit employee, who signed the appropriate form to obtain the records; (b) used by the agency during the fitness-for-duty examination; and (c) provided to her by the employee. The appellant also asserted that she sent an e-mail message to the bargaining unit police officers "warning them that [they] are apparently being RECORDED and transcribed by your Chief in violation of the DVA/AFGE Master Agreement," and that she had received, as President of the American Federation of Government Employees local, written communication from the HRMS chief "threatening to take disciplinary action against me if I communicate with the bargaining unit employees on this issue."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her July 14, 2006 Step-3 grievance of her removal, the appellant asserted that there was no just cause for the action because she obtained the documents in the course of her representational duties, the documents were used by the agency in assessing a bargaining unit employee, the employee (and the union as proxy) is entitled to review such documents, she did not refuse to follow instructions, but merely asked for the legal basis for the agency's order, and there was no basis for the agency to order the union to return documents legally obtained in the course of representation. The appellant also alleged that the action was based on reprisal for protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To better understand the legal issues in this appeal, we briefly review the statutory scheme that underlies the parties' contentions. In 1978, Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) to replace the prior "patchwork" system of laws that had governed federal employment with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 445 (1988). Prior to the CSRA, federal employees could bring employment actions in a variety of administrative and judicial forums, sometimes leading to confusing and contradictory results. <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 132 F.3d 784, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Under the CSRA's simplified and integrated scheme, however, employment matters that involve federal employees' rights to engage in union-related activities generally may be brought before the FLRA as ULP charges, while matters involving such major adverse actions as removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, and furloughs of 30 days or less, are within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116, 7118, 7512-7513; <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> 132 F.3d at 787-88.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Chapter 71 of the CSRA, it is a ULP for a federal agency to "interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right" granted by the Chapter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). It is also a ULP for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in a labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment, and to discipline or otherwise discriminate against an employee because the employee has filed a complaint, affidavit, or petition. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2), (4). A victim of an alleged ULP may petition the General Counsel of the FLRA and, after investigation, the General Counsel may file a complaint with the FLRA on behalf of the party making the allegations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(1). The FLRA may conduct hearings to resolve such complaints. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(6). Once it determines that a governmental employer has committed a ULP, the FLRA is empowered to order broad remedial action that includes forbidding the agency from engaging in similar activity as to all of its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(g)(3); <span class="Italic">Wildberger,</span> 132 F.3d at 787.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA precludes the FLRA from adjudicating certain types of <span id="Page_423"></span>employment actions. Specifically, "[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised [before the FLRA] as unfair labor practices..." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d) (first sentence). The "appeals procedure" relevant to this case is provided by the Board which, under the CSRA, must adjudicate employee appeals from removals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d). Section 7116(d) also provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except for matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(e), in turn, provides that "matters" covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512, which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure, may be raised, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, either under the appellate procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both, and that an employee shall be deemed to have exercised the above option at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal or timely files a grievance in writing, whichever event occurs first. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), arbitration awards in matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure may be reviewed judicially in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, under the first sentence of section 7116(d), that the propriety of the appellant's removal, including "issues" relating to that removal, can properly be raised in an appeal filed with the Board and may not, therefore, be raised as a ULP before the FLRA. Consistent with the integrated scheme contemplated by the CSRA, this sentence of section 7116(d) effectively "dictates the appropriate forum" for the appellant's challenge of her removal. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Commerce v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 976 F.2d 882, 888 (4th Cir. 1992) ("Commerce"). In this case, the appellant was required to challenge her removal under an "appeals procedure," <span class="Italic">id,</span> i.e., under either the negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e). Thus, the arbitrator erred as a matter of civil service law in failing to apply this provision to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the arbitrator erred in interpreting the second sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). The arbitrator held that because the substance of the appellant's <span class="Italic">May 31, 2006 ULP charge</span> did not fall within the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512, the substance of that charge did not fall within the "operating exclusion" of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e), which is set forth in section 7116(d). He then found that, because the appellant filed the May 31, 2006 ULP charge first, she could not challenge her removal through the grievance process because both cases involved the same "predicate facts." However, the requirement in the second sentence of section 7116(d) that an employee choose between filing a grievance or a ULP does not apply in matters, such as the instant removal, that can be raised in either the negotiated grievance or appeals procedures. Thus, the proper question before the arbitrator should have been whether <span class="Italic">the removal</span> fell within the exception to the grievance-or-ULP election requirement of section 7116(d), not whether the <span class="Italic">May 31, 2006 ULP charge</span> fell within that exception. The appellant's removal clearly involves a matter wherein, under section 7121(e), she has the option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure. Thus, in the matter before the arbitrator, the appellant had the option of using the negotiated grievance procedure to challenge her removal. There is nothing in the plain language of section 7116(d) indicating that a removal may not be heard by an arbitrator if any "predicate facts" at issue in the case have previously been raised in a ULP charge. In fact, the arbitrator's approach runs counter to the "integrated scheme" contemplated by the CSRA because it denies the appellant any forum in which to challenge her actual removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding is consistent with the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Commerce,</span> 976 F.2d at 884, which involved an employee (Edward Hanlon) who, upon receiving an informal, written "record of infraction" from his superiors charging him with lodging an excessive number of administrative and judicial employment actions, filed a ULP with the FLRA contesting the "record of infraction." While the ULP was pending, the Department of Commerce removed Mr. Hanlon based on his frequent resort to adversarial administrative and judicial proceedings, and Mr. Hanlon filed a grievance challenging the removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court held that Mr. Hanlon's initiation of a grievance procedure challenging his removal "subsumed" his earlier-filed ULP charge, and that he was required to bring his entire administrative claim under the grievance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court reasoned that the first sentence of section 7116(d) dictated the appropriate forum for Mr. Hanlon's challenge to his removal, which was the grievance/MSPB procedure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 888. The court further noted that because Mr. Hanlon's removal fell within the exception under the second sentence of section 7116(d), he did not fall into the category of those employees who may choose between pursuing an employment action under the grievance procedure or as a ULP charge, and "sole jurisdiction lies in the MSPB." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, based on the above analysis and precedent, which we find persuasive, we conclude that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not preclude the arbitrator in this case from adjudicating the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the record is fully developed and credibility determinations are not necessary for the Board to make factual findings and conclusions, the Board will examine the record evidence and submissions on review to determine whether an arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Sands v. Department of Labor,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 8 (2001). Nevertheless, considerations favoring resolution of an arbitration decision without remand, such as delay and additional cost, "may be outweighed under certain circumstances and remand would then be appropriate." <span class="Italic">Appling v. Social Security Administration,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 375, 379 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, a hearing has been held by the arbitrator in which eight witnesses testified regarding the merits of the agency's charge and the appellant's affirmative defenses. As set forth in the above description of the arbitrator's award, factual findings relating to these issues have not been made. We find that credibility determinations may need to be made in this case, and that the demeanor of the witnesses may be a factor to be considered. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987) (to resolve credibility issues, a Board administrative judge must consider factors that include the witness's demeanor). Arbitrators are in the best position to make credibility determinations having been present to hear the testimony and judge the demeanor of witnesses. <span class="Italic">De Bow v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 6 (2004). Under these circumstances, and given the limited factual review the Board generally conducts in these types of cases, we find that remand of this case to the arbitrator for the issuance of a new award is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Cf. Newman v. Corrado,</span> 897 F.2d 1579, 1581-83 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (rejecting the arbitrator's claim that he was without authority to consider a petition for reconsideration of his decision overturning a removal, and remanding the case to the arbitrator for consideration of that petition); <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Veterans Admin. Medical Center,</span> 892 F.2d 1036, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (reversing and remanding, for a decision on the merits, an arbitrator's dismissal of a grievance for lack of jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Huey v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 782 F.2d 1575, 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reversing an arbitrator's dismissal of a grievance appeal as untimely filed and remanding for a hearing on the merits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, if the FLRA has issued a decision on any issues raised in the ULP charge, the doctrine of collateral estoppel might be applied to preclude those issues from being relitigated. <span class="Italic">See Wynne v. Department of the Army,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 320, 326 (1990) (the arbitrator did not err in applying collateral estoppel where the appellant was convicted of assault in a criminal trial), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 940 F.2d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) The issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action. <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Here, however, there is no indication that any of the issues identified by the arbitrator have been "actually litigated" before the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See Hamiter v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 17 (2004) ("actually litigated" means that the issue must have been contested by the parties and submitted for determination by a court or other neutral adjudicator).</p>
