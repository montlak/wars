<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-300"><span class="space">4.</span> Recovery From Disability</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Street v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 335, 340-43 (1984), arrived at an interesting result concerning the relation between poor performance and disability. An AJ may not consider evidence of recovery from the disability following separation as a mitigating factor following removal for physical inability to perform the job. Recovery was not reasonably foreseen by the agency at the time it selected removal. Although the agency was not faulted for firing the employee, recovery related to whether the agency action enhances service efficiency. After the appellant presented evidence of recovery, the agency action was reversed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the presiding official properly admitted into the record the evidence of appellant's recovery from disability, although such evidence came into existence subsequent to the removal action and was not considered by the agency in effecting his removal. The limitation, which the agency urges, on the presiding official's authority to admit <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence that had not been submitted to the agency "would render nugatory the right of appellants to a hearing pursuant to 5 USC 7701(a) and 1205(a)(1) and our implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1201.24(c)." <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 349, 6 MSPR 404, 413 (1981)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board finds that the presiding official properly heard appellant's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence of his recovery from disability, the Board concurs with the agency that the presiding official erred in considering the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence as a factor in mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Holloman v. Veterans Administration,</span> 11 MSPB 86, 12 MSPR 445 (1982) (the presiding official erroneously relied on the appellant's being granted a disability retirement some three weeks after the effective date of the removal in mitigating the penalty to a suspension because the appellant's offenses were unrelated to the disability retirement determination, the agency was not a party to the disability application and could not have been expected to have known its outcome at the time it removed him, and such evidence is not a factor that should generally be considered in reviewing an agency-imposed penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>).[20] In the instant case, appellant's recovery could not have been reasonably foreseen by the agency at the time it selected the penalty of removal and his <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence does not pertain to the factors that are generally considered in reviewing an agency-imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;Further, evidence of an appellant's physical or mental disability should be analyzed generally as an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination challenging the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the adverse action, rather than as a mitigating factor<span class="Italic">. See Smith v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 15 MSPR 611 at 612-13 (1983) (the presiding official erred in considering the appellant's alleged mental handicap as a basis for mitigating the penalty); <span class="Italic">McClarty v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 15 MSPR 199 at 201 (1983) (the presiding official erred by analyzing the appellant's claim of alcoholism as a possible mitigating factor rather than as a claim of handicap discrimination based on alcoholism).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, however, that appellant's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence is relevant and material to the determination of whether the action effecting appellant's separation is taken "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a). The "efficiency of the service" is the ultimate criterion for determining both whether any disciplinary action is warranted and whether the particular sanction may be sustained, and those determinations are distinct and must be separately considered. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPB at 329-30, 5 MSPR at 302-03. In the instant case, there has been a unique intervening substantial change in appellant's physical condition after decision at the agency level and upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the presiding official. The <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence submitted by appellant is directly material to the sole charge on which he was removed, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, physical disability, and it is related to the physical condition which formed the basis for his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant had been examined by the agency's medical officer and was treated by two personal physicians prior to the removal action, none of them diagnosed his urological condition or found him physically unable to perform the duties of his position until the agency's physician conducted the July 1983 fitness for duty examination. Shortly after appellant was removed he diligently obtained new medical assistance that led to his recovery from his urological problems and he timely presented this evidence at the hearing before the presiding official. The presiding official found that appellant's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> medical evidence and his testimony were credible and established that he was currently physically able to perform the duties and responsibilities of his position despite the discomfort caused by his lumbar spine problem....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concurs with the presiding official that the agency showed by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position at the time he was separated. The Board also finds, however, upon consideration of the unique circumstances of this case that appellant's <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence was timely submitted for consideration by the presiding official at the regional office hearing and that the evidence is of sufficient weight to be determinative of the outcome. The Board does not impugn the judgment of the agency based on the facts that it knew at the time it effected appellant's removal. The Board, nevertheless, finds that the adverse action taken by the agency resulting in appellant's separation is not "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 MSPB at 329-30, 5 MSPR at 302-03.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Street</span> is based on the assumption that the agency fails to rebut the appellant's assertion that she can return to the job as a result of recovery during the period between the adverse action and the Board hearing. If the evidence from the agency or from the appellant demonstrates that the appellant could not return to full duty in her position because of the continuing effects of her illness, <span class="Italic">Street</span> offers the appellant no comfort. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 646, 654 &#x00B6; 17 (2003). <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> was unclear, however, distinguishing <span class="Italic">Street</span> on the basis of the statement that "[i]n this appeal, in contrast, when the <span id="Page_2866"></span>agency attempted to return the appellant to her position, she claimed that she continued to have restrictions on her ability to lift; [s]he made it clear that she was unable to return to full duty in her position of record because of the continuing effects of her illness."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rationale of <span class="Italic">Street</span> was explained and reaffirmed by <span class="Italic">Wren v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 28, 31-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-15, 2014 MSPB 20 (2014), emphasizing the need for clear evidence of recovery from the date of removal to the time of the Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not cited by the administrative judge, there is a line of Board case law that stands for the proposition that, even when an agency proves by preponderant evidence that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position at the time he was removed, the removal action may be rescinded on the basis that such action would not promote the efficiency of the service, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), where the evidence clearly and unambiguously demonstrates that the appellant has recovered during the pendency of a Board appeal such that he is able to perform the essential duties of his position. The first case so holding was <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 335 (1984), where the employee recovered from his disabling condition within 2 months of his removal. This holding was applied to reverse a removal action in <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 676 (1988), where the employee recovered within 3 months of the effective date of his removal, and was reaffirmed when the Board denied the Office of Personnel Management Director's request that the Board reconsider and reverse this line of precedent, <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991). Recently, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 8 (2013), the Board stated that post-removal evidence of recovery must clearly and unambiguously establish the appellant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position in order to warrant reversal of a removal for physical inability to perform. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Casillas v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 627, 633-34 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The holdings in <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> were based on several premises: (1) the Board has "<span class="Italic">de novo</span>" review authority and may consider evidence that was not available to the agency when it made its decision; (2) the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) is the "ultimate criterion" for determining both whether any discipline is warranted and whether a particular penalty may be sustained; (3) inherent in an action effecting a removal for physical inability to perform is that such inability will be permanent or at least long-enduring rather than temporary; and (4) as the "last voice" in the Executive Branch, the Board must avoid the "manifest absurdity" of upholding a removal for physical incapacitation when intervening events show that the appellant is no longer incapacitated and, thus, removal cannot promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. at 610-13; <span class="Italic">Street</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 340-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reviewing court recently issued a decision in <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Although <span class="Italic">Norris</span> did not involve a removal for inability to perform, we believe that the opinion nonetheless supports the Board's approach with regard to the admissibility and potential relevance of post-removal evidence in such cases. In <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, the court framed the issue as "whether the arbitrator was obligated to consider new, post-removal evidence in mitigation of the penalty that was not before the deciding official," 675 F.3d at 1355, and it resolved that question in the affirmative. In so ruling, the court emphasized the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> nature of Board proceedings, as did <span class="Italic">Street</span> and <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, and further stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Given the Board's duty to conduct an independent assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine the reasonableness of the penalty, we see no reason to distinguish between requiring the Board to consider new evidence relating to the agency's decision on the merits of the underlying misconduct and requiring the Board to consider new evidence regarding the reasonableness of the penalty imposed. Thus we think new evidence, even on the question of penalty, should be considered by the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1356 (citation deleted). The court concluded that "the arbitrator erred in holding that 'post-removal...good conduct is not relevant to the issue before the arbitrator.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. The court thereafter remanded the case to the arbitrator with instructions to consider the appellant's post-removal evidence in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty imposed, while explicitly declining to express any opinion as to the weight to be given that evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. As noted above, the Board has, in cases involving removal for physical inability to perform, said that post-removal evidence of recovery must clearly and unambiguously establish the appellant's ability to perform the essential functions of the position to warrant reversing a removal. Therefore, we must examine whether the appellant's proffered post-removal medical evidence meets that standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing the probative weight of medical opinion, the Board considers whether the opinion was based on a medical examination, whether the opinion provided a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from mere conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with the appellant's treatment. <span class="Italic">Slater v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 15 (2008); <span class="Italic">see also Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 17 (2012) (a medical opinion unsupported by medical evidence, e.g., a diagnosis, clinical findings, etc., is not very persuasive). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that Dr. Bronnimann's May 2012 report does not clearly and unambiguously establish that the appellant had in fact recovered sufficiently from his condition at that time as to enable him to engage in the work-related travel necessary to his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Bronnimann's May 2012 letter contains nothing but a bare opinion--that the appellant can engage in work-related travel as long as the travel duration is no more than 2 weeks at a time. This opinion is unsupported by clinical findings or any discussion of the basis for the opinion, and contradicts Dr. Bronnimann's May 2011 opinion, noted above, that the appellant should not engage in any work-related travel. The appellant admitted at the hearing that Dr. Bronnimann had not examined him since March 2011, which was the basis for Dr. Bronnimann's previous opinion that the appellant should not engage in any work-related travel. We note that the administrative judge did not discuss the contrary opinions of Dr. Boulet or Dr. Carnett, also noted above. The only other opinion discussed by the judge in the initial decision was that of Dr. Knowles, whose opinion was viewed as less persuasive than that of Dr. Bronnimann because he was not a treating physician and had not conducted an examination of the appellant. Both Drs. Boulet and Carnett had examined and treated the appellant, and both concluded that he was not able to engage in significant work-related travel. Dr. Carnett conducted his last examination in May 2011, 2 months later than Dr. Bronnimann's last examination. In his response to the agency's petition for review, the appellant pointed out that there was evidence of telephone conversations between him and Dr. Bronnimann after the doctor's last physical examination. The existence of telephone conversations between Dr. Bronnimann and the appellant, in which the appellant expressed his own opinion that his medical condition had improved, could not be considered adequate to justify a change in Dr. Bronnimann's opinion about the appellant's medical condition, especially where Dr. Bronnimann's later report did not include any indication of his reasoning process in reaching his conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 7 (2013), where we concluded that a new medical report did not outweigh the great weight of consistent reports over a 2-year period that the appellant was medically unable to perform the essential duties of her position, the conclusory opinion expressed in Dr. Bronnimann's May 2012 report does not outweigh the consistent reports of other doctors (as well as Dr. Bronnimann's own 2009 and 2011 reports) over more than a 2-year period that the appellant was unable to engage in substantial work-related travel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that, even considering Dr. Bronnimann's May 2012 report, the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant was medically unable to perform the duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a mixed case such as this, i.e., one in which an individual alleges that a personnel action that is directly appealable to the Board was taken against him because of discrimination, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2), the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 are straightforward: "the Board shall...decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures...." Regardless of whether the agency's removal action against the appellant was being reversed on the merits, the appellant was entitled to an adjudication of his claim that the agency committed disability discrimination by failing to provide a reasonable accommodation for his medical condition. As discussed above, the administrative judge did not determine whether the agency discriminated against the appellant by failing to provide him a reasonable accommodation; he instead reserved any questions about whether an accommodation was available to a possible compliance proceeding if there were questions concerning back pay due to the appellant. It was error for the administrative judge not to adjudicate the appellant's claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the present record is insufficient to make a determination as to whether the agency could have provided the appellant an effective accommodation. A remand to provide a fuller record and adjudication is appropriate in such circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Kitaura v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 270, 271 (1999); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 486, 493 (1998); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 74, 79 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Should the administrative judge determine on remand that the agency committed disability discrimination, he shall order an appropriate remedy. If the administrative judge should determine that the agency did not commit disability discrimination, he will need to address the reasonableness of the removal penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Owens v. DHS</span>, 2023 MSPB 7, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2023), confirmed the continuing viability of <span class="Italic">Street</span> and its progeny. Just as the hearing before the MSPB was concluding on the removal for inability to perform the duties of appellant's position for <span id="Page_2867"></span>medical reasons (a work-related injury), the Labor Department certified that appellant had fully recovered. Over the dissent of Member Leavitt, the Board determined, reversing the removal, distinguishing restoration rights (discussed in Chapter 14) from the "efficiency of the service" standard for pending adverse action appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the merits of the appeal, the agency does not challenge, and we discern no reason to disturb, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant fully recovered from his work-related injury while his removal appeal was pending before the administrative judge. Instead, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant is entitled to restoration to his previous position as a result of his recovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of this argument, the agency relies on the Office of Personnel Management regulations governing the restoration rights of employees who recover from a compensable injury, which are found at 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 5-7. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a), an employee who fully recovers from a work-related injury within 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to restoration to his former position or an equivalent one. By contrast, an employee who separated due to a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date compensation eligibility began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time Government employment), is entitled to agency-wide priority consideration for his former position or an equivalent one if he applies for reappointment within 30 days after the cessation of compensation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). The agency argues that, because the appellant did not fully recover from his work-related injury within 1 year from the date he became eligible for compensation, he is entitled to priority consideration only, not restoration to the position from which he was removed for medical inability to perform. Therefore, the agency asserts, the initial decision should be reversed inasmuch as it orders the agency to restore the appellant to his former position effective April 23, 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument addresses restoration rights, but not the propriety of the appellant's removal. Therefore, it is unavailing. It is well settled that the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) is the "ultimate criterion" for determining both whether any discipline is warranted and whether a particular penalty may be sustained. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 7 (2014); <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 611 (1991). The Board has held that when an appellant presents unambiguous evidence of complete recovery from the medical condition that resulted in his removal before the administrative judge has issued an initial decision in his removal appeal, the removal action does not promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Casillas v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 627, 634 (1994); <span class="Italic">Morgan</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. at 613 ("Thus, when it is apparent that the appellant's inability to perform is temporary in nature and, in fact, that the appellant has recovered even before the Board can render an initial decision in an appeal, the Board correctly and properly refuses to hold that the agency's removal action is for the efficiency of the service."). The Board has consistently followed this rule since it was first established in <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 335, 340-43 (1984), nearly 40 years ago. As noted above, it is undisputed that the appellant fully recovered from his work-related injury before the administrative judge issued his initial decision in this appeal. Given these circumstances, we find that the administrative judge correctly reversed the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sanders v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 144, 149-50, 153-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11, 19-21, 2015 MSPB 7 (2015) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. DHS</span>, 625 Fed. Appx. 549 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP)), emphasized that evidence of post-removal recovery must be clear and, although the decision did not say as much, convincing. Sanders, a Customs and Border Protection Officer, was removed for inability to perform the essential duties of his position when psychiatric fitness examinations concluded that he could not work in a stressful law enforcement environment. While the appeal was pending before the AJ, two other psychiatrists examined Sanders and concluded that he was fit for duty. The AJ credited the later reports and reversed the removal. The Board, on PFR, decided that the evidence from the psychiatrists credited by the AJ was not sufficiently clear to overcome the agency's medical evidence--the agency's medical evaluations were considered more complete--and removal was affirmed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reversing the removal action on the ground that new medical evidence showed that the appellant was able to perform the duties of his position, the administrative judge relied on a line of precedent that began with <span class="Italic">Street v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 335 (1984). These cases hold that, even where an agency proves by preponderant evidence that the appellant was unable for medical reasons to perform the duties of his position when he was removed, the removal action will be reversed on the basis that such action does not promote the efficiency of the service if, during the pendency of the Board appeal, the appellant presents new medical evidence showing that he has recovered such that he is able to perform the essential duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 8 (2013); <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 610-13 (1991); <span class="Italic">Street</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 340-43.[6] In a recent case, the Board stated that this line of precedent applies "where the evidence clearly and unambiguously demonstrates that the appellant has recovered during the pendency of a Board appeal such that he is able to perform the essential duties of his position." <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 6 (2014). The Board noted that this line of precedent was consistent with a then-recent decision by our reviewing court in which the court ruled that the Board must consider new, post-removal evidence in mitigation of the penalty that was not before the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency argues that the <span class="Italic">Street/Morgan</span> line of cases should not be applied to agency removal actions based on psychiatric reasons because psychiatric assessments are less definitive. The agency cites nothing to support its theory that actions based on psychiatric conditions should be viewed differently, and we discern no reason to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is not on all fours with the <span class="Italic">Street/Morgan</span> line of precedent in that the post-removal medical report issued by Drs. Gower and Werner does not "clearly and unambiguously" find that the appellant recovered from the psychiatric conditions noted in the original reports issued by Drs. Skop and Prunier. <span class="Italic">See Wren</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 6. It does, however, indicate that at the time of Drs. Gower and Werner's August 2013 assessment of the appellant, he did not suffer a psychiatric condition, including those identified in Drs. Skop's and Prunier's assessment. Because this is probative, but not necessarily dispositive, evidence of whether the appellant currently suffers from a psychiatric condition, we conclude that the <span class="Italic">Street/Morgan</span> doctrine applies and the evidence should be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant was unable to perform the essential duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not cite any particular legal standard or test for determining whether the agency proved its charge that the appellant was unable to perform the essential duties of his position. The Board has held, however, that where an employee occupies a position with medical standards or physical requirements and the finding that he was unable to perform was based on medical history, the agency is required to show the following in order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform: (1) the disabling condition itself is disqualifying; (2) its recurrence cannot be ruled out; and (3) the duties of the position are such that a recurrence would pose a reasonable probability of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 8 (2014); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206. The appellant's CBPO position had physical requirements, and thus the standard set forth above is applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while Drs. Gower and Werner's post-removal medical evidence is probative and thus must be considered, after carefully weighing the totality of the evidence, we conclude that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the appellant's condition disqualifies him from his CBPO position, its recurrence cannot be ruled out, and the duties of the CPBO position are such that a recurrence would pose a reasonable probability of harm. Thus, we find that the appellant is physically unable to perform the duties of his position.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In its petition for review, the agency contends that the Board must give deference to an agency's determination that an employee does not meet the fitness-for-duty standards of a position because "the [a]gency is in a better position than the [B]oard to determine whether medical evidence supports or disproves an employee's ability to properly perform the essential duties of his position." In support of its position, the agency cites the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1251-52 (Fed. Cir. 1999), in which the court found that the Board must give deference to an agency's penalty determinations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 15-17. We are unaware of a Board or Federal Circuit decision holding that the Board must defer to an agency's determination of an employee's medical ability to perform the essential duties of his position. The agency does not cite any such authority for that proposition in its petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The removal penalty does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recently observed that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors do not apply in an adverse action based on inability to perform because of the nondisciplinary nature of the agency action. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 18. The standard to be applied in such cases is whether the penalty of removal exceeded the "tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 14 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 122 Fed. Appx. 513 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). When, as here, an employee cannot perform the essential duties of his position, the Board must generally examine whether the agency has any vacant positions within the employee's restrictions to which the employee could be assigned. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 19. The Board has recognized an exception to this general rule when the employee has refused to cooperate with the agency's attempts to accommodate the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2868"></span>Here, the record shows that the agency offered the appellant the opportunity to apply for any available positions for which he might qualify, including outside of his current commuting area. The appellant rejected this offer. Accordingly, the agency did explore the possibility of reassigning the appellant to another position, but he rebuffed the agency's effort. Under these circumstances, we find that the removal penalty does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
