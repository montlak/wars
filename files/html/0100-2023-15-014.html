<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and FCC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-188.html">71 FLRA 962</a>, 962-63 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring), offered general guidance on stays of FSIP proceedings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Panel asserted jurisdiction over the disputed articles and some of the unopened articles.&#x2003;However, the Panel refused to assert jurisdiction over the nine unopened articles involved in the negotiability petition pending Authority resolution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Panel's direction, the parties participated in additional mediation but were unable to reach a full agreement. Consequently, the Panel directed the parties to provide it with written submissions regarding the remaining articles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 27, 2020, the Union filed a motion to stay the Panel proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Union has not shown that a stay of the Panel proceedings is warranted.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7119(c)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) establishes the Panel as "an entity within the Authority"[3] and "authorizes [the Panel] to investigate 'promptly' any negotiation impasse and to 'take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse.'"[4] Panel orders are not directly reviewable by the Authority or the courts.[5] Instead, the Statute provides an avenue for parties to challenge a Panel order. Specifically, it is a ULP for an agency or a labor organization "to fail or refuse to cooperate in impasse procedures and impasse decisions."[6] A party that fails or refuses to comply with a Panel order, and is consequently charged with a ULP, may then challenge the Panel's order.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1499 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Brewer</span>) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5)(A), (B)(iii)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d at 1500.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly acknowledged that it is guided by the principle that administrative "tribunals may properly stay their own orders when they have ruled on an admittedly difficult legal question and when the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained."[8] In considering whether the equities of a case warrant staying a Panel order, the Authority has examined, among other things, whether granting or denying a stay would: advance the purposes of the Statute;[9] be consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient government;[10] deprive the moving party of meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its positions;[11] and respect the statutory framework for the resolution of impasses and other types of disputes.[12] The Authority has applied the power to stay very "narrowly,"[13] finding "unusual circumstances" warranting a stay in only two cases: <span class="Italic">SSA</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>.[14] In both of those cases, not only did the equities warrant a stay, but the parties at impasse were litigating difficult legal issues that were pending judicial resolution and intertwined with the Panel's assertion of jurisdiction.[15]</p>

<span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 40 FLRA 1048 (1991) (vacating a stay following judicial resolution of the controlling dispute), considered whether FLRA could stay a FSIP directive that the parties take a dispute to interest arbitration. The dispute involved proposals concerning certain wages and fringe benefits that were before the courts on negotiability issues. FLRA determined in the 1988 decision that it had jurisdiction to grant the stay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first consider whether, as a general matter, the Authority is empowered to stay its orders. As to this question, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705 states in relevant part that "[w]hen an agency finds that justice so requires, it may postpone the effective date of action taken by it, pending judicial review." The authority given to an administrative agency to stay its orders under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705 when "justice so requires" is less restricted than that of a reviewing court to postpone the effective date of an agency's order or otherwise maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>; the reviewing court may take such action only "to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provisions of the Statute are also instructive.&#x2003;Section 7105(a)(2)(I) of the Statute states that the Authority shall take actions which are necessary and appropriate to effectively administer the Statute. Section 7101(b) of the Statute states that its provisions should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government. Therefore, in addition to assigning the Authority with specific enumerated responsibilities in other subsections of 7105, the Statute provides the Authority with the flexibility to take actions consistent with the effective administration of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, we are asked to stay two orders of the Panel....&#8197;The Panel's orders were issued in proceedings which resulted directly from Authority negotiability decisions involving the same parties and the same proposals and which are now before the court of appeals. The underlying dispute--the Agency's obligation to bargain over the proposals--has been and continues to be the subject of extensive litigation. The Panel's orders did not resolve the negotiation impasses presented to it, but rather directed the parties to submit their disputes to interest arbitration for a binding decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in [<span class="Italic">Commander, Carswell AFB, Texas and AFGE Local 1364</span>, 31 FLRA 620 (1988)]...indicates that consideration of duty to bargain questions by third parties like the Panel and interest arbitrators is appropriate only where the duty to bargain questions have been resolved by precedent and the answers to those questions are well settled. Before directing a matter to interest arbitration, the Panel should itself determine whether such an action is appropriate in light of any pending duty to bargain questions. <span class="Italic">Carswell</span> is not intended to suggest that interest arbitration is appropriate where, as in the unusual case before us, the underlying duty to bargain issue has been brought to the Panel's attention, arises directly from an Authority negotiability determination which is now before the court of appeals, and cannot reasonably be viewed as well settled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, where we have been afforded the necessary flexibility by statute, where an action of a component of the Authority is involved, where the Panel and the Authority cases are inextricably linked, and where the underlying situation involves protracted judicial and administrative litigation which has consumed considerable time and resources, we find that we have the authority to consider the Agency's stay motions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether to grant the stay requests, we are guided by the principle that administrative "tribunals may properly stay their own orders when they have ruled on an admittedly difficult legal question and when the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained." <span class="Italic">Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Commission v. Holiday Tours</span>, 559 F.2d 841, 844-45 (D.C. Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this guidance, we find that stays of the Panel's orders directing interest arbitration are warranted at this time....&#8197;[T]he underlying issue in dispute...is an "an admittedly difficult legal question."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties have been actively litigating the issues involved in these cases before the Authority and the courts for over 7 years.&#x2003;During this time, no bargaining has occurred. For the third time during the course of this protracted dispute, Authority decisions involving these matters are pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in our view, the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained. The underlying issue is a matter in litigation, and is subject to the negotiability procedures developed for resolution of these matters....&#8197;A requirement that the parties engage in interest arbitration during the same time that the negotiability of the same proposals involved in the interest arbitration is being litigated before the courts is inconsistent with the effective administration of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the unusual circumstances of this case, we find that the public interest would best be served by delaying further interest arbitration proceedings until the court of appeals issues its decision. In this manner, the statutory framework for the resolution of the negotiability disputes, including the role of the judicial review process, would be respected. Following issuance of the court's decision, appropriate motions to govern the course of the impasse proceeding should be filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are mindful that Congress did not intend Panel decisions resolving negotiation impasses to be directly reviewable by the Authority....&#8197;In the instant case, we emphasize that we are not reviewing the merits of a final Panel order involving the resolution of a collective bargaining impasse. We conclude only that the Panel's orders...should not be effectuated at this time because to do so could frustrate the statutory procedures, including the role of the judicial review process, for the resolution of negotiability disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent">A stay of a Panel proceeding was denied to an agency that argued the issues involved in a ULP charge filed by the union were intertwined with the issues in the Panel case. FLRA concluded that the "unusual circumstances" in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> were not presented by the petitioning agency. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 34 FLRA 137, 137 (1990); <span class="Italic">see AFSCME Local 2830 and DOJ, Office of Justice Programs</span>, 59 FLRA 802 (2004) (union did not establish "unusual circumstances" necessary to stay FSIP proceedings pending resolution of negotiability case, ULP case, and unit clarification proceeding). A stay of a Panel proceeding was sought but the matter was dismissed as moot when the Panel subsequently determined it would relinquish jurisdiction following an arbitrator's decision that the parties were not at impasse. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 63 FLRA 26 (2008).

The Panel's decision is reviewable, first before the Authority, then in court, in an unfair labor practice proceeding," (citations omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is not affected by the Union's assertion of constitutional challenges to the Panel's jurisdiction, as these are issues that can be raised before the Authority through the same statutory proceedings.[13] And while the Authority is empowered to stay Panel decisions "in very narrow circumstances,"[14] it has "found, only once, that a stay of a Panel order was warranted."[15] Citing our decision in that case--<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA 1311 (1988) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>)[16]--the Union asserts that "'unusual circumstances' exist in the instant case warranting a stay" of the Panel's assertion of jurisdiction.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, an agency requested that the Authority stay a Panel order directing the parties to submit their issues at impasse to interest arbitration for a binding decision.[18] The disputed proposals concerned bargaining&#8209;unit employees' wages and benefits,[19] and the parties had been actively litigating the negotiability of those proposals for several years.[20] Indeed, at the time of the agency's request to stay the Panel's order, two of the Authority's negotiability decisions--involving the same parties and "substantively identical proposals"--were pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[21]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1138-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the agency's request, the Authority determined that it was empowered to stay the Panel's order pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705, which provides that "[w]hen an agency finds that justice so requires, it may postpone the effective date of action taken by it, pending judicial review."[22] The Authority also found that, because "the underlying issue is a matter in litigation, and is subject to the negotiability procedures developed for resolution of these matters,"[23] it was appropriate to stay further action by the Panel until the court issued its decision regarding the negotiability of the contested proposals.[24]</p>

(further concluding that a "requirement that the parties engage in interest arbitration during the same time that the negotiability of the same proposals involved in the interest arbitration is being litigated before the courts is inconsistent with the effective administration of the Statute").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's request in the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> in two crucial respects. Unlike the request in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Union is not asking the Authority to stay the Panel's proceedings while the parties to the dispute litigate a court action that is potentially dispositive of their issues before the Panel. Indeed, as of the date that the Union filed its motion, no case related to the parties' dispute before the Panel was pending between the parties in any judicial forum.[25]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;While the Union notes in its motion that another union has challenged, through a pending federal court action, the Panel's jurisdiction on grounds similar to those asserted by the Union, it specifically notes that its "claims in the instant case are related, <span class="Italic">but are separate and distinct from</span>" the claims brought by the other union in its court action. Member Abbott observes that, conversely, the Union goes on to note that its interest in the other union's civil action has been recognized by that court, such that it has been granted permission to submit an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief in the other union's action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And, unlike in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Union is asking the Authority to stay further Panel proceedings "until such time as the <span class="Italic">Authority</span> rules on the Union's objection[s]" regarding the Panel's jurisdiction. But, as noted, Panel orders are not directly reviewable by the Authority. It necessarily follows that we cannot stay further proceedings by the Panel pending a ruling on objections that we are not empowered to make.</p>

In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority stayed a Panel order directing parties to interest arbitration while two of the Authority's negotiability decisions--involving the same parties and "substantively identical proposals"--were pending in federal district court.[9] A stay was appropriate because interest arbitrators could not apply well-settled Authority precedent, as required by <span class="Italic">Commander, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas</span>, until the federal district court resolved the pending appeals of the Authority's negotiability decisions.[10] Since <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority has applied its power to stay Panel orders "narrowly."[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority granted a stay of the Panel's order where the Union was a direct party to pending litigation in federal district court arising from the same bargaining dispute before the Panel.[12] Because of the pendency of parallel proceedings in federal district court, the Authority found that implementing the Panel's order at that time would not advance the purposes of the Statute.[13]</p>

FSIP</span> (<span class="Italic">AALJ</span>).[17] In <span class="Italic">AALJ</span>, a party objected to the Panel's order by challenging the constitutionality of Panel appointments. But the Union fails to show how any difficult legal issues present in <span class="Italic">AALJ</span> are intertwined with the Panel's order here. The Union did not raise the constitutionality questions now pending litigation in <span class="Italic">AALJ</span> during its own challenge to the Panel's order. And unlike both <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Union here is not a party to the dispute pending judicial resolution.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also looked to the "equities of the case" to determine whether a stay "would respect the statutory framework for the resolution of negotiability disputes" and "advance the purposes of the Statute."[18] Here, the Union states that "implementing the Panel's decision without first resolving the Panel's lawful composition [would] be irreversible[.]" But, in its motion, the Union recognizes that the statutory framework provides an avenue for Authority review when, after failing or refusing to comply with a Panel order, a party is charged with a ULP. The Union fails to argue why this avenue of relief is unsatisfactory. Further, granting the Union's motion would widen a traditionally narrow Authority power by inviting parties outside of federal district court litigation to halt unrelated Panel orders. For these reasons, the Union fails to show that the "equities of the case" warrant a stay.[21]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Since <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority has applied the power to stay a Panel order very "narrowly,"[16] granting a stay in only one other case. In <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, the Authority granted a union's motion to stay a Panel order where "parallel proceedings" were pending in federal district court.[17] The Authority concluded that implementation of the Panel's order "would not advance the purposes of the Statute."[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union argues that the Authority must stay the Panel proceedings. The Union cites <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> and relies on a recently filed complaint with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which questions the constitutionality of the Panel's composition. But, as both <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> establish, a moving party must exhibit more than the mere existence of a parallel proceeding pending judicial review. Specifically, the moving party must also show how "the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained"[20] and that a stay would be "consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient Government."[21] The Union fails to argue either point. Instead, it repeatedly alleges that the Authority should grant the stay because the parties were never at impasse. That allegation fails to "respect the statutory framework for review of Panel orders."[23] As noted above, Panel orders--including Panel determinations regarding impasse[24]--are "not directly reviewable by the Authority."[25] The ULP procedures of &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute and the judicial review provisions of &#x00A7; 7123 offer the Union the means of having that claim adequately adjudicated.[26] Thus, granting a stay based on the Union's allegation that the parties were not at impasse would "interject the Authority prematurely into the carefully developed system of review."[27] Moreover, granting a stay would be inconsistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government as it would only delay the conclusion of the parties' bargaining, which has been ongoing for the last five years.[28]</p>

This extraordinarily protracted and contentious bargaining history, which the Agency highlights throughout its brief opposing the stay and which the Panel notes repeatedly in its decision, was lacking in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, where the parties had been bargaining for less than two years (inclusive of ground rules) at the time the Authority issued its stay. <span class="Italic">See U.S. SSA, Office of Hearing Operations</span>, 20 FSIP 001, at 2 (2020). The parties' "ineffective and inefficient" bargaining history, which required two different rounds of Panel intervention and fifty-five different sessions with three different mediators, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Comm</span>., 20 FSIP 021 at 1-2, provides ample reason to deny the Union's stay request. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA at 1136 (noting that the Authority's power to issue stays derives from its duty to take such other "actions which are necessary and appropriate to effectively administer the" provisions of the Statute, and interpret the Statute's provisions "in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government,"). In balancing the equities of this case, the Authority cannot turn a blind eye to the prolonged and contentious manner of the parties' bargaining history, as doing so would undermine the Statute's purposes of promoting constructive labor-management relationships and "the effective conduct of public business." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA at 1139 (noting that actions which "would likely only engender further administrative and judicial litigation" do not "advance the purposes of the Statute.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The timing of the Union's motion further militates against a stay. In this regard, the Union asserts that staying the Panel's order is "imperative." However, the Union waited more than three months after the Panel asserted jurisdiction to request a stay.[30] The Union does not explain that delay--nor does it contend that circumstances prevented it from requesting a stay back in March 2020.[31]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;The Union's actions in its District Court lawsuit further undermine its argument that a stay is urgently required. Unlike the union in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, which promptly moved for a preliminary injunction in District Court four days after filing its initial Complaint and obtained an expedited briefing schedule, <span class="Italic">see</span> Docket <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Admin. Law Judges v. Fed. Serv. Impasses Panel</span>, No. 1:20-cv-1026, (D.D.C. filed Apr. 20, 2020), the Union here has not moved for a preliminary injunction or taken any other action in District Court to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in the nearly two months since it first filed its lawsuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> Docket, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org. v. Federal Service Impasses Panel et al</span>, No. 1:20-cv-01563 (D.D.C. filed June 15, 2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;We are also troubled by the timing of the Union's constitutional arguments. There is no indication that the Union had similar concerns over the Panel's composition when the parties utilized the Panel's services in 2016 to resolve their ground-rules dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, because the Panel issued an order, the Authority is unable to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> that the Union seeks in its motion to stay the Panel <span class="Italic">proceedings</span>. Therefore, it is unnecessary to address the Union's assertion that "once [a Panel] decision on the merits is issued, there is no incentive for the parties to reach an agreement voluntarily." Nevertheless, we take the opportunity to remind both parties that they had nearly five years and 146 bargaining sessions to "reach an agreement voluntarily." Providing them with more time would not advance the purposes of the Statute or represent an effective administration of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in response to the dissent, we note that the Authority's precedent makes clear that no litigant is entitled to a stay. Instead, stays are only granted where "the equities of the case suggest the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained."[34] Far from being a statutory entitlement of individual parties, the Authority's ability to grant stays derives from its broad supervisory powers to "take such other actions as are necessary and appropriate to effectively administer the provisions of" the Statute[35] and to interpret the Statute "in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."[36] To reflexively stay the Panel's proceedings whenever a party had filed a lawsuit in federal district court collaterally attacking the Panel's jurisdiction, regardless of the equities or any other conceivable circumstance, "would likely only engender further administrative and judicial litigation"[37] and eviscerate the Panel's ability to perform its statutory duty "to make swift decisions in order to end disputes in which the negotiation process between a federal agency and its employees has failed."[38] Such a simplistic rule, advocated by the dissent, would in no way "advance the purposes of the Statute"--instead, it would disserve the Statute by charting a clear path for litigious parties to delay Panel processes at will.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 63 FLRA 183, 185-86 (2009), denied a stay of a Panel decision determining the course of ground rules bargaining, with reference to and elaboration on the 1988 <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority's Decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Union relies on <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, a case in which the agency requested stays of orders issued by the Panel, which orders directed the parties to submit the issues in dispute to interest arbitration. The disputed issues in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>concerned the agency's obligation to bargain over wages and money-related fringe benefits, which the Authority noted had been the subject of extensive and continuing litigation, including cases then pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA at 1137. The Authority further noted that, in addition to the cases pending before the D.C. Circuit, numerous other cases involving the obligation to bargain over wages and money-related fringe benefits were pending in other United States courts of appeals, and other related unfair labor practice cases were also pending at various stages of the administrative process. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1134.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>that it was empowered to stay the disputed Panel orders because: (1) the Authority was afforded <span id="page_1188"></span>the necessary flexibility by statute; (2) an action of a component of the Authority was involved; (3) the Panel and Authority cases were inextricably linked; and (4) the situation involved protracted judicial and administrative litigation that had consumed considerable time and resources. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1138-39. The Authority cited 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 705, as granting an administrative agency the power to postpone the effective date of its actions, pending judicial review, when justice so requires. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1136. In addition, the Authority determined that the Statute empowers it to take actions that are consistent with the effective administration of the Statute based on &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(I), which empowers the Authority to "take such...actions as are necessary and appropriate to effectively administer the provisions of [the Statute,]" and from &#x00A7; 7101(b), which directs that the provisions of the Statute are to "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the linkage of Panel and Authority cases, the Authority noted that the disputed Panel orders were issued in proceedings which resulted directly from Authority negotiability decisions involving the same parties and the same proposals and that, as set forth above, the negotiability decisions were pending before the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1137. The Authority further noted that the disputed Panel orders did not resolve the impasse, but, instead, directed the parties to submit their disputes to interest arbitration for binding decision. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In the Authority's view, the orders were not appropriate because they disregarded duty-to-bargain questions that could not be considered well-settled under<span class="Italic"> Commander, Carswell Air Force Base, Texas</span>, 31 FLRA 620 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Carswell</span>). <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1137-38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority acknowledged the principle that administrative "tribunals may properly stay their own orders when they have ruled on an admittedly difficult legal question and when the equities of the case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1138 (quoting <span class="Italic">Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm'n v. Holiday Tours</span>, 559 F.2d 841, 844-45 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). In applying this principle, the Authority determined that the underlying issue of the negotiability of wage and money-related fringe benefit proposals was a difficult legal question and that the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> should be maintained because implementation of the Panel's orders directing interest arbitration would likely engender further administrative and judicial litigation and would not advance the purposes of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1138-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the "unusual circumstances" of the case, the Authority also found that the public interest would best be served by delaying further interest arbitration proceedings until the court of appeals issued its decisions. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1139. In particular, the Authority found that a stay would respect the statutory framework for the resolution of negotiability disputes, including the role of the judicial process. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Authority recognized that Congress did not intend Panel decisions resolving negotiability impasses to be directly reviewable by the Authority. However, the Authority emphasized that it was not reviewing the merits of the Panel orders, but, instead, was only acting to prevent effectuation of the Panel orders at that time. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Consequently, the Authority ordered the Panel orders stayed until the D.C. Circuit ruled in the related negotiability cases. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1140.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B. Authority decisions applying <span class="Italic">NTEU</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Agency, the Authority has applied <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> to resolve two subsequent requests for stays of Panel proceedings. In <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, the agency requested that the Authority stay the Panel's order in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service</span>, 90 FSIP 42, which directed the parties to meet with a Panel member to resolve issues concerning the parties' ground rules negotiations. The agency asserted that a stay was warranted because it had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the union and the issues raised in the charge were inextricably intertwined with the issues in the Panel case. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, 34 FLRA at 137. The Authority summarily denied the agency's request for a stay on the ground that the "unusual circumstances" present in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> were not present in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span> <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, the union asserted that the Authority should stay the Panel's assertion of jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, </span>04 FSIP 27 because there were three cases pending before other components of the Authority, which were inextricably linked to the impasse matters before the Panel. <span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, 59 FLRA at 802. As in <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, the Authority summarily denied the union's request for the stay, concluding that the"unusual circumstances" similar to those present in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> were not present in<span class="Italic"> AFSCME</span>. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">C. Application of Authority Precedent</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the only case in which the Authority has granted a request for a stay of a Panel proceeding, "unusual" and "unique" circumstances involving a Panel order that was not appropriate under <span class="Italic">Carswell </span>intertwined with difficult legal issues pending judicial resolution were present. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 32 FLRA at 1132, 1139. Neither <span class="Italic">AFSCME </span>nor <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. </span>involved these circumstances and, as a result, the Authority rejected reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>and summarily denied the requests for a stay. <span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, 59 FLRA at 802; <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, 34 FLRA at 137. The denials of these requests demonstrate how narrowly the Authority has applied <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case now before the Authority, we conclude that the Union has not demonstrated that there is a Panel order that both is not appropriate under <span class="Italic">Carswell </span>and is intertwined with difficult legal issues pending judicial resolution. Consequently, consistent with the narrow application of <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>in<span class="Italic"> Customs Serv.</span> and<span class="Italic"> AFSCME</span>, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>provides no basis on which to grant the requested stay. We likewise conclude that the Union fails to demonstrate that the equities of this case suggest that the <span class="Italic">status quo </span>should be maintained. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the equities warranted a stay because further litigation would not advance the purposes of the Statute and a stay would respect the statutory framework for the resolution of negotiability disputes. Without addressing the individual arguments of the Union, what they collectively fail to show is how a stay would advance the purposes of the Statute and respect the statutory framework for the review of Panel orders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This matter involves the resolution by the Panel of a negotiation impasse under the statutory authority of &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7119 establishes the Panel as an independent entity within the Authority and commits to the Panel the broad authority to make decisions to resolve negotiation impasses. <span class="Italic">Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d at 1499. That broad authority denies direct review of Panel orders by either the Authority or the courts. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1499-1500. To grant the stay in the circumstances presented would undermine the framework of the Statute for the resolution of impasses and would interject the Authority prematurely into the carefully developed system of review. <span class="Italic">See NATCA, AFL-CIO v. Fed. Serv. Impasses Panel</span>, 437 F.3d 1256, 1265 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Moreover, the record does not show that, even if the Union's view of the Panel's order is correct, a denial of the request will deprive the Union of meaningful and adequate means of vindicating its position. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1264-65. In particular, as the Union acknowledges, the unfair labor practice procedures of &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute and the judicial review provisions of &#x00A7; 7123 offer the Union the means of having its claims adequately adjudicated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the issuance of a stay is not warranted in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, we deny the Agency's request for sanctions similar to the remedies ordered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3732</span>. The remedies in<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 3732</span> were ordered as the result of an unfair labor practice hearing before an administrative law judge, who concluded that the respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(5) of the Statute and recommended that the Authority order the respondent to cease and desist and to take certain affirmative action. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3732</span>, 16 FLRA at 330-32. The Authority adopted the judge's conclusion and recommended order. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 318-320. This case, a proceeding to resolve a request for a stay of a Panel decision, is not appropriate for what is essentially a request by the Agency to adjudicate an allegation that an unfair labor practice has been committed.</p>
