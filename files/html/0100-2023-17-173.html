<p class="noindent">The treatment of government-wide regulations issued after contracts are in effect was explored in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 983, 985 (1982), a negotiability case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first issue before the Authority concerns the negotiability of those portions of Article 2 sections 1A and B, Article 32 section 10A and Article 40 section 3 which establish that whenever provisions contained in the negotiated agreement conflict with Government-wide or agency-wide rules or regulations issued after the date the agreement became effective, the agreement provisions will prevail. The Authority, in agreement with the Union, concludes that these provisions are consistent with the language of the Statute and its legislative history. In this regard, section 7116(a) provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Sec. 7116. Unfair labor practices</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The conference committee report concerning this section stated as follows: [2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The conference report authorizes, as in the Senate bill, the issuance of government-wide rules or regulations which may restrict the scope of collective bargaining which might otherwise be permissible under the provisions of this title. as in the House, however, the Act generally prohibits such government-wide rule or regulation from nullifying the effect of an existing collective bargaining agreement. The exception to this is the issuance of rules or regulations implementing section 2302. Rules or regulations issued under section 2302 may have the effect of requiring negotiation of a revision of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement to the extent that the new rule or regulation increases the protection of the rights of employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;H. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 155 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, while the duty to bargain under section 7117 of the Statute does not extend to matters which are inconsistent with existing Government-wide rules or regulations or agency-wide rules or regulations for which a compelling need is found to exist, once a collective bargaining agreement becomes effective, subsequently issued rules or regulations, with the exception of Government-wide rules or regulations issued under 5 U.S.C. 2302 (relating to prohibited personnel practices), cannot nullify the terms of such a collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the provisions here in dispute are within the duty to bargain under the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In May 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 13,837 (the executive order).[3] Addressing official time under &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute, the executive order required agencies to: (1) "strive for a negotiated [official-]time rate of [one] hour or less" per bargaining-unit employee each fiscal year (the one-hour rate); (2) with exceptions not relevant here, schedule employees to "spend at least three-quarters of their paid time...each fiscal year[ ] performing agency business" (the three-quarters mandate); and (3) avoid implementing the executive order in a way that "abrogate[d] any collective[-]bargaining agreement in effect on the date of th[e] order."[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In July 2018, while renegotiations were ongoing, the Agency sent the Union memoranda stating that the Agency would immediately implement certain provisions of the executive order, including the one-hour rate and the three-quarters mandate. The memoranda also stated that the Agency had "terminated" provisions of the parties' agreement that conflicted with those executive-order provisions. The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency's implementation of the executive order violated the parties' agreement, the Statute, and the executive order itself. The grievance proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator held that the Agency's decision to terminate its compliance with Articles 2 and 48 had no "reasonable basis" in the executive order, the most recent rollover agreement, or the extended agreement. He rejected the Agency's comparison to correcting illegal overtime payments. The Arbitrator noted that, in the overtime-payments decision, the controlling regulations existed before the parties' agreement went into effect, but, in the current dispute, the executive order issued <span class="Italic">after</span> the extended agreement went into effect. Because the Agency acted based on unreasonable interpretations of the pertinent authorities, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency committed "clear and patent" breaches of Articles 2 and 48, which he found went to the "heart" of the extended agreement. Consequently, he held that the Agency committed ULPs by repudiating Articles 2 and 48, in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. And for the same reasons, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the executive order's prohibition on abrogating existing agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the executive order was a government-wide regulation that the Agency had the authority to implement immediately upon its issuance.[21] Because the award faulted the Agency's immediate implementation, the Agency argues that the award should be set aside as contrary to law. However, the Agency's argument ignores &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s clear prohibition on enforcing rules and regulations that "conflict with any applicable collective[-]bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed."[23] The Arbitrator found that, under the plain wording of the continuance clause, the extended agreement was in effect before the President issued the executive order.[24] Thus, &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) prohibited immediate enforcement of the executive order where it conflicted with provisions of the extended agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency notes that the President issued the executive order in accordance with his authority to regulate the civil service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301.[25] The Authority has recognized in negotiability disputes that executive orders issued pursuant to statutory authority "are to be accorded the force and effect" of a "law" enacted by Congress.[26] However, recognizing that an executive order has the force and effect of law does not mean that the executive order is beyond the reach of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement bar. Indeed, the Authority has recognized that several types of <span class="Italic">regulations</span> are accorded the force and effect of law, but they remain regulations that are subject to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement bar, rather than statutes that are beyond the reach of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7).[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority recently recognized that the executive order at issue in this case is a government-wide regulatory action that is subject to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement bar.[28] And that holding was consistent with guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on implementing the executive order. In particular, OPM advised agencies to treat the executive order as a regulation for purposes of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7): "[A]ll relevant provisions of the [executive order] become operative and enforceable <span class="Italic">at the conclusion of a current term</span> of a [collective-bargaining agreement]."[29] Thus, neither the Authority's recent precedent on &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7), nor OPM's guidance on implementing the executive order, supports treating the executive order like a statute, rather than a regulation subject to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement bar.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency argues that &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) did not apply in this case because the Authority has held that &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s prohibition on enforcing newly issued regulations applies "for the express term of the agreement during which the [g]overnment-wide regulation was first prescribed, but no longer."[30] But the award is consistent with the Authority's previous applications of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) because, when the President issued the executive order, the parties were in the midst of an "express term" of their agreement--that is, the term coinciding with their ongoing renegotiations--and that term will run "until a new agreement is negotiated."[31] We reject the Agency's argument to the contrary.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Separately, the Agency asserts that it did not repudiate the agreement in violation of the Statute, or abrogate the agreement in violation of the executive order, because "management cannot be bound by a [contract] provision that conflicts with law."[32] However, the Agency relies on a decision in which the Authority found that an agency need not abide by a contract provision that conflicted with <span class="Italic">statutory law</span>.[33] As already explained, unlike rules and regulations, statutes are not subject to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement prohibition. But the executive order is not a statute, and &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7) prohibits the enforcement of any rules or regulations, including executive orders, that conflict with preexisting collective-bargaining agreements.[34]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;Exceptions Br. at 17 (citing <span class="Italic">GSA, Wash., D.C</span>., 50 FLRA 136, 138 (1995) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 50 FLRA at 138 (finding agency did not violate the Statute by refusing to honor a contract provision in conflict with the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act of 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;As stated in note 17 above, this case does not implicate the exception to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7)'s enforcement bar for rules and regulations that implement a ban on prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency repeats the argument that it presented to the Arbitrator about how the Agency's actions in this case were supposedly analogous to an agency immediately suspending overtime payments that government-wide regulations prohibited.[35] However, the Arbitrator correctly explained that the overtime-payments case differed from the instant dispute because the controlling regulations in the overtime-payments case existed <span class="Italic">before</span> the agreement between those parties went into effect. Here, the executive order was issued <span class="Italic">after</span> the extended agreement went into effect, and, consistent with &#x00A7; 7116(a)(7), the extended agreement controlled for the remainder of its express term. Thus, we reject this argument on the same basis as the Arbitrator.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;Exceptions Br. at 18 (citing <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, 70 FLRA at 630).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;Although the Agency's contrary-to-law exception also includes a challenge to the Arbitrator's remedy directing the restoration of official time to the Union, the premise of this remedial challenge is that the parties' agreement was not extended but, instead, permanently expired. Exceptions Br. at 19 ("Article 48...[was] no longer in effect,...and therefore, cannot provide a remedy above [the executive order's limits]."). For the reasons set forth in note 24 above, the Authority's Regulations bar consideration of the Agency's expiration argument. Thus, the Regulations also bar the Agency's remedial challenge because it depends entirely on the expiration argument. We dismiss the remedial challenge accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the reasons above, we deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
