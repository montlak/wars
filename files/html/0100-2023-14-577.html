<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DOD, DCA Central Region</span>, 54 FLRA 218, 219 (1998), declared negotiable a proposal to geographically swap employees holding similar positions to protect senior employees against RIF:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At least thirty (30) days prior to issuance of RIF Notices, bargaining unit employees with the lowest retention standing for their competitive level in the bargaining unit will be reassigned to the RIF affected bargaining unit location, reassigning the higher retention standing unit employee(s) to non-RIF affected unit location.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R-45</span>, 54 FLRA at 222-28:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As plainly worded, the proposal would require the Agency to reassign employees to locations within the bargaining unit, based on the employees' "retention standing" prior to issuing a RIF notice. The locations to which reassignments would be made depend on Agency decisions about locations that would be affected by a RIF. The Union states that the reference to "retention standing" is intended to incorporate the factors establishing retention standing set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501. The Union also states that the proposal does not involve the filling of vacancies, and that the proposal only involves the "swap" of employees within the bargaining unit who are qualified and who occupy identical positions. The Union's explanations are consistent with the wording of the proposal and, therefore, we adopt them. <span class="Italic">See Laurel Bay</span>, 51 FLRA at 737 (when a proposal is silent as to a particular matter, a union statement clarifying the matter is considered consistent with the proposal's plain wording so long as the statement otherwise comports with the proposal's wording).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, consistent with the plain wording of the proposal and the Union's statements of intent, the proposal would require the Agency, prior to conducting a RIF, to place qualified bargaining unit employees with the lowest retention standing in the entire unit, as determined under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501, in identical affected positions at the location where the Agency intends to conduct the RIF. The effect of the proposal would be that employees in identical positions would be swapped from one unit location to another based on their retention standing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Interfere With</span> <span class="Italic">Management's Right To Assign Employees Under</span> <span class="Italic">Section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to determine the qualifications and skills needed to perform the work of the position, including such job-related individual characteristics as judgement and reliability, and to determine whether employees meet those qualifications. The right to assign employees also includes the discretion to determine which employees will be assigned to particular positions. In addition, the Authority has determined that proposals requiring an agency to place an employee into a vacant position in another location at the election of the employee, without regard to whether the agency intends to fill that position, interferes with management's right to assign.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority has found that management's right to assign employees under 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute is not abridged by proposals involving only the decision as to the location where employees, who are assigned to positions and who management has already determined possess the required qualifications, will perform duties previously assigned to their positions. <span class="Italic">See ATF</span>, 43 FLRA at 1458. For example, in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 6 FLRA 508, 517 (1981) <span class="Italic">(IRS)</span>, which examined a proposal that required the agency to select employees for reassignments based on tenure of employment, the Authority held that because the proposal involved the reassignment of employees from one location to another without an accompanying change in the duties performed by the employees, it did not affect management's right to assign employees. The Authority noted that employees affected by the proposal had already been "chosen by the [a]gency to perform duties substantially similar to those required in the new assignments" and were essentially being moved to perform those duties in another location without any other change<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal at issue in this case, as described above, requires the Agency to reassign employees, based on their retention standing, from one bargaining unit location to another, where they will perform identical duties in an identical position. As such, the reassignment required by the proposal only involves the location in which an employee will perform the duties of his or her position. The proposal does not require the Agency to fill a position at another unit location at the election of the employee without regard to whether the Agency wants that position filled; the position at that location already exists and is occupied. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">ATF</span>, 43 FLRA at 1458. Further, contrary to the Agency's assertion, the proposal does not require the Agency to make determinations regarding selection based on criteria that are not related to the position to which the employee will be reassigned. The proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine whether the employee possesses the skills and qualifications needed to perform the duties of the position at the new location, because the Agency has already made that determination when it assigned the employee to the same position at another location. <span class="Italic">Cf. Overseas Education</span>, 53 FLRA at 908. Additionally, the proposal does not impair the Agency's discretion to make a determination at any time that, based on its needs regarding a particular position, it is necessary to reassign a particular employee. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Health Care</span> <span class="Italic">Financing</span>, 44 FLRA at 1490.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we conclude that the proposal, which involves only the reassignment of employees from one bargaining unit location to another without a change in the duties performed by the employee, does not affect management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 6 FLRA at 517.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Interfere With</span> <span class="Italic">Management's Right To Select Employees From Any</span> <span class="Italic">Appropriate Source Under Section</span> <span class="Italic">7106(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that proposals requiring management to fill vacancies from a single source directly interfere with management's right to select employees from any appropriate source. <span class="Italic">See International Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 3 and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, <span class="Italic">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 51 FLRA 451, 458-59 (1995) (proposal requiring the agency to fill a vacant position that was abolished by a RIF with a former incumbent of the position interferes with management's right to select employees from any appropriate source); <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers Association</span>, <span class="Italic">OEA/NEA and U.S. Department of Defense, Stateside Dependents</span> <span class="Italic">Schools, Laurel Bay Schools, Laurel Bay, South Carolina</span>, 49 FLRA 679, 683 (1994) (proposal requiring the agency to permit reassigned employees to return to a former location if a position is vacant at that location interferes with management's right to select from any appropriate source).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the plain wording of the proposal and the Union's explanation, the proposal does not relate in any way to the filling of vacancies. Rather, it requires the Agency to reassign existing employees to existing positions that are already occupied by an employee at a different bargaining unit location. As the proposal neither obligates management to fill, nor prevents management from filling, vacant positions, we conclude that the proposal does not interfere with management's right to select employees from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Is Not Inconsistent With 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501 because it requires the "reassignment of bargaining unit employees prior to a RIF solely on the basis of lowest retention standing[.]" The Agency does not explain this allegation, and the basis for the contention is unclear. In particular, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501, which provides that employees' retention standing must be determined on the basis of their "tenure of <span id="page_1048"></span>employment, veteran preference, length of service, and performance" ratings, concerns retention standing following the issuance of a RIF notice and the proposal concerns actions taken prior to issuance of such notice. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501(a). However, even if we were to construe the Agency's argument as a claim that the proposal conflicts with the regulatory requirements regarding whether an employee is entitled to a position during a RIF, we have construed the proposal as incorporating 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501 and, therefore, the proposal is not inconsistent with that section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency supports its contention with regard to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501 by citing to <span class="Italic">Laborers' International Union</span> <span class="Italic">of North America, AFL-CIO-CLC, Local 1267 and Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency, Defense Depot Tracy, Tracy, California</span>, 14 FLRA 686 (1984) <span class="Italic">(Laborer's International)</span>. However, nothing in <span class="Italic">Laborer's International</span> provides a basis for finding the proposal outside the duty to bargain. In <span class="Italic">Laborer's International</span>, the Authority found that sections of a proposal were intended to govern RIF retention rights of employees because they required the agency, during a RIF, to offer vacant shifts to employees only on the basis of seniority. The Authority held that such sections were inconsistent with Office of Personnel Management "RIF regulations" because the proposal failed to consider all the requirements for retention standing set forth in the regulations. 14 FLRA at 688. In contrast, the proposal at issue here does not require the Agency to retain employees on a basis other than that set forth in section 351.501. In fact, consistent with that regulation and <span class="Italic">Laborer's</span> <span class="Italic">International</span>, the proposal does not affect the Agency's ability to retain or RIF employees on the basis of their retention standing as established pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency has not asserted any other basis for its contention that the proposal is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.501, we conclude that the proposal is not outside the duty to bargain on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Is Not Inconsistent With 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the proposal is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402, which sets forth the requirements for establishing a competitive area. However, the Agency's arguments in this regard are misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is nothing in the plain wording of the proposal or the Union's explanation indicating that the proposal affects the Agency's determination as to appropriate competitive areas within the bargaining unit. The proposal requires action prior to the issuance of the RIF notice and places no constraints on the terms of that notice, including the competitive area. Specifically, the proposal, which makes no reference to competitive areas, requires the Agency to reassign employees who have the lowest retention standing in the bargaining unit to the RIF affected bargaining unit location prior to issuing a RIF notice. The Agency is free to determine what the competitive area is for the purposes of the RIF. Further, nothing in the proposal prevents the inclusion of both unit and nonunit employees in the competitive area as established by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's assertion that the proposal will affect the "retention privileges of bargaining unit employees based on labor representation considerations[,]" we are unable to discern the basis for the Agency's argument because the Agency fails to explain this contention. Nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402 involves either "retention privileges" or "labor representation considerations." Moreover, the assertion alone, without further elaboration, is not persuasive. There is nothing in the proposal, as construed above, that affects the factors upon which retention privileges are determined. Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency has not asserted any other basis for its contention that the proposal is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402, we conclude that the proposal is not outside the duty to bargain on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an arrangement in <span class="Italic">AFGE and VA</span>, 55 FLRA 1154, 1156 (1999), was a proposal requiring the agency to fill available contracting positions at other locations with qualified contracting specialists who would otherwise lose their positions when the agency centralized its contracting offices. Seniority rather than agency merit selection procedures was an acceptable basis for filling the positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. The purported arrangement must be "tailored" to compensate employees suffering adverse effects flowing from the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union,</span> <span class="Italic">Chapter 243 and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent</span> <span class="Italic">and Trademark Office, </span>49 FLRA 176, 184 (1994). If a proposal is intended to be an arrangement, then the Authority balances the parties' respective interests to determine whether the proposed arrangement is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard, </span>21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that because the Agency is closing contracting offices, "employees will either lose their jobs or have an opportunity to be placed into another position." The Authority has found that proposals requiring management to fill vacancies with employees who have lost, or are threatened with the loss of, their jobs constitute arrangements for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to select. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2635</span> <span class="Italic">and Naval Communications Unit, Cutler, East Machias,</span> <span class="Italic">Maine, </span>30 FLRA 41, 43 (1987). The proposal is tailored because it would ameliorate the adverse effects only for employees who would otherwise lose their jobs. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal constitutes an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights, we conclude that the effects of the proposal on the Agency's rights under section 7106(a) are not significant. In this regard, nothing in the proposal would affect the location of positions, or Agency decisions regarding how it will conduct its operations under the reorganization. Similarly, the proposal would not require the Agency to fill positions it does not intend to fill. Additionally, the proposal would not require management to fill the positions with employees it has determined are not qualified to perform the duties of the positions. With respect to use of seniority to make selections, we note Authority precedent holding that, where management has authority to determine that employees are equally qualified for work assignments, a proposal requiring selection based on seniority does not affect management's rights to assign employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See American Federation</span> <span class="Italic">of Government Employees, Local 1138, Council 214</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, 645 Air Base Wing, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, </span>51 FLRA 1725, 1730 (1996). No reason to depart from this precedent is argued or established in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the benefits to employees from the proposal are significant. Put simply, the proposal would allow employees who might otherwise lose their jobs to continue their employment with the Agency, at least for 1 year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the benefits to employees outweigh the burdens the proposal imposes on the exercise of management's rights. Accordingly, the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's rights, and is within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 2024 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, </span>37 FLRA 249, 256 (1990).</p>
