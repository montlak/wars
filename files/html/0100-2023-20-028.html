<p class="Body-Text">The Board got it right in <span class="Italic">Blowing The Whistle: Barriers to Federal Employees Making Disclosures</span> (MSPB 11/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While observing wrongdoing is the first step in the whistleblowing process, not everyone who sees wrongdoing chooses to tell anyone else what they have observed. To blow the whistle, someone has to make some noise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061761464f3d129711759">464 F.3d 1297</a><span class="Italic">,</span> 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006) ("When a disclosure is of protected subject matter, it is more likely than not to be critical of management, perhaps highly critical.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But some people get carried away with whistleblowing and the results can be adverse. In <span class="Italic">Church v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 737, 739, 6 MSPB 615 (1981), a removal was sustained despite the AJ's conclusions that the appellant was subjected to harassment for disclosures and complaints of mismanagement and bad working conditions. His complaints about the harassment contributed to his removal. The AJ also concluded, however, that the appellant was grossly insubordinate and provocative toward his supervisors, that he did little work, and that he spent nearly all of his time preparing numerous grievances and lawsuits against his supervisors. The Board decided that the removal was based on legitimate considerations. <span class="Italic">Church</span> also cited <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Alexander</span>, 607 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1979), determining that it was nonretaliatory to transfer an employee who spent 35% of his working hours preparing EEO complaints. The quantity of the complaints and the time spent preparing them were factors taking the matter out of the usual retaliation standards. The EEO complaints became the employee's principal occupation. In another decision from the Tenth Circuit, the court suggested that, in assessing a removal penalty, the Board and an employing agency could properly consider the negative reaction of coworkers toward an employee who continually reported their minor transgressions when the effect of that reporting was animosity between the appellant and his coworkers, leading to a violent confrontation with an employee. <span class="Italic">Duran v. MSPB</span>, 707 F.2d 1174 (10th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 361, 367-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-23 (2004), sustained removal of an employee who turned monitoring of employees (leading to her reports of misconduct) into an occupation that her managers attempted to stop:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that none of the appellant's disclosures was protected because she revealed trivial matters, such as whether her co-workers were arriving at work on time, whether they were taking longer than 15-minute breaks, and whether they were taking smoking breaks, and that these matters were none of the appellant's concern. The Board's case law is clear that time and attendance abuse is a violation of law, rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. DiGiorgio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 6 &#x00B6; 14 (1999); <span class="Italic">Frederick v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 563, 570 (1994). Even if some of the appellant's disclosures concerned trivial matters, there is no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception for the violation-of-law aspect of the protected disclosure standard<span class="Italic">. Berkley v. Department of the Army</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 341, 352 (1996). The appellant made specific allegations of time and attendance abuse that were based on her personal observations and supported by documentation. We find that the appellant had a reasonable belief that her disclosure evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, and her disclosure therefore was protected. We also find that the deciding official was aware of the appellant's disclosures and that the disclosures occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor<span class="Italic">. See Carey v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 676 &#x00B6; 13 (2003). Thus, the appellant has met her burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of persuasion now shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action absent any disclosure<span class="Italic">. Redschlag</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6; 70; <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. at 114; <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 237. When determining whether the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board considers the following factors: the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers, but who are otherwise similarly situated<span class="Italic">. Redschlag</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6; 70; <span class="Italic">Shaw</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. at 115; <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 240. We find that the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant absent any protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant was ordered to stop monitoring the comings and goings of her co-workers and to stop discussing her co-workers' activities in the office. She clearly disobeyed this order. Mr. George testified that, on September 20, 2001, when most of the employees were out of the office attending a picnic, he decided to stay behind to get some work done. While he was in his cubicle, he heard the appellant enter the work area and start flipping through some papers in a nearby cubicle. Mr. George testified that he told the appellant that there was no one there because everyone was at the picnic. The appellant then entered his cubicle, sat down in his desk chair, and asked him questions about what two co-workers were working on during the weekends. When Mr. George replied that they were working on certain data entry activities, the appellant then asked Mr. George what he was doing. The appellant also asked Mr. George questions about the two co-workers signing out a government vehicle, and she expressed her view that it was unnecessary for them to both take the vehicle on that occasion. Mr. George testified that the conversation made him feel uncomfortable, so he reported it to his supervisor, who directed Mr. George to put his account of the conversation in an email, which he did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant denied that this conversation ever took place. We agree with the AJ that Mr. George's testimony is more credible than the appellant's testimony on this issue. The appellant has presented no evidence or argument on review that persuades us that the AJ's credibility finding is incorrect, and we see no reason to disturb it<span class="Italic">. See Weaver</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 133-34. We conclude, therefore, that the September 20 incident occurred as described by Mr. George and as summarized by the agency in the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Mr. Henke had little motive to retaliate against the appellant. At the time he issued the removal notice, he had been in his position for less than six months. He had not been in the Farmington office for more than 10 years prior to that. Thus, the alleged misconduct reported by the appellant in June 2001 in no way reflected upon his management of the office because it concerned alleged activities that occurred when he was not even employed at Farmington.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, there was no evidence that the agency treated similarly-situated employees who were not whistleblowers more favorably than it treated the appellant. There is simply no evidence that anyone with a prior disciplinary record similar to that of the appellant committed similar misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, the appellant's protected activity is related to the agency's action. It was the appellant's June disclosures which triggered the issuance of the Notice to Cease and Desist, and it was her violation of that order that led to her removal. We find, however, that the agency has convincingly explained that the appellant was not removed because of her whistleblowing, but because of the disruptive nature of her investigatory monitoring of her co-workers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Otteni testified quite convincingly that his intent in issuing the Notice to Cease and Desist was not to prevent the appellant from whistleblowing, but to get her to stop spending so much time on monitoring her co-workers and to spend more time performing her duties. Mr. Otteni explained that the appellant's activities were causing disruption in the I&#x0026;E division, the atmosphere in the office was hostile and anxious, work was not being performed, and a group of employees approached him about filing a complaint about the appellant's "snooping." Mr. Otteni testified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There was this animosity between Ms. Grubb and other folks in the office that she was working with, so I wanted that to stop. I wanted her to do the work she was being paid to be doing. I wanted the other employees to go back to work and to stop being sort of paranoid by being watched and just do their job, and it got to the point where I felt there was nothing that I could do, short of this cease and desist, to get people to earn their pay. I mean, it was out of hand, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Otteni further testified that the appellant was clearly spending an inordinate amount of time documenting her co-workers' activities. This testimony is fully supported by the volume and detail of documentation that the appellant produced concerning her co-workers' alleged misconduct. It is obvious from the records that the appellant herself produced that she was keeping extremely detailed records, down to the minute on a daily basis, of when her co-workers arrived at the office, took a break, went to lunch, and left the office. The appellant also monitored the vehicles in the agency's parking lot to document the employees' comings and goings and their alleged misuse of government vehicles. <span id="Page_3673"></span>Under the circumstances, we find Mr. Otteni's rationale for issuing the Notice to Cease and Desist fully supported by the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, Mr. Otteni left the Farmington Field Office and was not involved in the decision to remove the appellant. Instead, Mr. Henke, who had no personal or professional stake in the appellant's disclosures or any consequences they might have produced, conducted an independent review of the situation. Mr. Henke testified that the atmosphere in the I&#x0026;E division was very tense and that employees were very suspicious of one another and did not communicate. Mr. Henke also explained why he did not permit the appellant to discuss the content of her protected disclosures during her reply to the proposed removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because of the subject of the proposed removal, you know the validity of [the appellant's] allegations, had no bearing on [the appellant's] conduct. This was not about [her] allegations. It was about [her] conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When the appellant questioned Mr. Henke as to how she could report wrongdoing without violating the Notice to Cease and Desist, Mr. Henke testified as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I think we're mixing apples and oranges here. [The appellant] was never under orders to not follow the chain of command [in reporting alleged wrongdoing]. Okay? What [the appellant] was under orders to do is to stop investigating of the misconduct that [the appellant] had repeatedly alleged [her] coworkers of [sic]. Okay?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[...]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nothing in the Cease and Desist Order was to say if you see a crime committed in the workplace you weren't to follow the chain of command in that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this testimony and all of the evidence of record, we find that the agency did not remove the appellant because of her protected activities. The agency removed the appellant because her monitoring activities were disruptive to the workplace in that the appellant was spending a significant amount of her time investigating her co-workers rather than performing her duties. Moreover, the appellant's activities were upsetting to her co-workers to the extent that they, too, were spending an inordinate amount of time discussing her activities instead of performing their duties. As a result, the agency ordered her to stop monitoring the activities of her co-workers, but the appellant disobeyed the order, which upset Mr. George, a new employee to the division who was trying to fit in and who did not want to get involved in the office conflict. After reviewing the record as a whole, we are left with the firm conviction that the agency removed the appellant because she disobeyed the Notice to Cease and Desist, and not because of her protected activity. We find, therefore, that the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant absent any whistleblowing on her part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the AJ that the penalty of removal is reasonable. The appellant has four prior suspensions within the two years prior to the notice of proposed removal. Those prior suspensions all involve charges of disobeying supervisory instructions, disruptive conduct in the workplace, disrespectful behavior towards supervisors, and/or unprofessional behavior. The agency's attempts to correct the appellant's behavior through progressive discipline clearly have not worked, and the appellant displays little potential for rehabilitation<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Murry v. General Services Administration</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 554 &#x00B6; 9 (removal was reasonable penalty for disrespectful behavior towards a supervisor in light of the appellant's prior disciplinary record for similar offenses, her lack of remorse and failure to take responsibility for her misconduct, and her poor potential for rehabilitation), <span class="Italic">rev. dismissed</span>, No. 03-3297 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 12, 2003); <span class="Italic">Render v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 441 &#x00B6; 17 (2001) (removal was reasonable penalty for charges of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, failure to follow instructions and disrespectful behavior, in light of the appellant's prior disciplinary record for similar offenses, her lack of remorse and recognition that her conduct was improper, and her poor potential for rehabilitation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee's job is to perform the duties of his position, not to convert his job into a continuing confrontation with management. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nagel v. DHHS</span>, 707 F.2d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1983). 5 USC 2302(b)(8) does not authorize "spying" on fellow employees. An appellant who was observed recording the conversations of fellow employees and photographing them was not engaged in protected whistleblowing under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and the employee made no disclosures. <span class="Italic">Risner v. FAA</span>, 7 MSPR 480, 486, 7 MSPB 342 (1981). The employee was legitimately removed for failing to comply with several requests to stop his activities and failing to report for a fitness-for-duty examination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Blunt or provocative language does not remove a disclosure from protection for a whistleblower, as in <span class="Italic">Durr v. VA</span>, 104 MSPR 509, 512 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 19 (2007) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Durr v. MSPB</span>, 297 Fed. Appx. 966 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), further remand for readjudication by AJ, <span class="Italic">Durr v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 195, 2013 MSPB 12 (2013)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We grant the appellant's petition for review, however, to address his argument regarding his disclosures about the agency's computer system. On June 18, 2003, the appellant left the following voice mail message with the agency's Information Resources Management Help Desk:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is Dr. Durr. I have a full clinic and only four rooms. I have this computer that has not worked now for ten days. This is bullshit. If the computers will not work, I will have to close the clinic.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the appellant was blunt or intemperate, standing alone, does not bring this disclosure outside the protection of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1304-06 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The problem with the voice mail message is that it is not specific. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (an employee who discloses a "substantial and specific danger to public health or safety" is protected from retaliation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite Robert Whitmore's highly unprofessional and intimidating conduct, which may well ultimately justify some adverse personnel action, he is nevertheless a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> whistleblower. Mr. Whitmore is therefore entitled to the full scope of protection afforded by the Whistleblower Protection Act, which ensures for him and whistleblowers everywhere that they need not fear retribution for disclosing to the public such vital information concerning an agency or official as "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or...gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Congress decided that we as a people are better off knowing than not knowing about such violations and improper conduct, even if it means that an insubordinate employee like Mr. Whitmore becomes, via such disclosures, more difficult to discipline or terminate. Indeed, it is in the presence of such non-sympathetic employees that commitment to the clear and convincing evidence standard is most tested and is most in need of preservation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Language may become sufficiently offensive that it loses protection. <span class="Italic">Oliver v. DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 465, 472 (1987), seemed to endorse protection of some internal disclosures of mismanagement, but suggested that employees making those disclosures lose their protection if they are unduly uncivil in their presentations. Oliver's disclosures were of matters protected by law; they were directed against the proposing and deciding officials; and they were the subject of the adverse action. Yet the disclosures lost their protection, and were a basis for discipline, when they accused the officials of "lacking in personal integrity and moral authority, dishonest, incompetent, and appallingly ignorant" and "being not qualified for their positions, of instituting management practices 'akin to lunacy,' of possessing paranoid assumptions, and of having a lynch mob mentality." <span class="Italic">See Dabner v. EPA</span>, CH-4324-17-0458-I-1 (NP 4/28/2023) ("Wrongful or disruptive conduct is not shielded by the presence of a protected disclosure, and the character and nature of a disclosure can still be a legitimate basis for discipline. <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 673, &#x00B6; 12 (2011)."). [<span class="Italic">Oliver</span> is discussed at greater length in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-215.html#sec8-214">Prohibited Personnel Practice Analysis</a>" under "<a href="0100-2023-15-210.html#sec8-209">Critical Statements.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD,</span> AT-1221-10-0662-W-1 (NP 9/30/2011), considered disclosures unprotected that were, although covered, sufficiently lacking in civility to establish clear and convincing evidence to support a short suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note that the agency does not challenge the administrative judge's findings that the appellant made protected disclosures and that some of those disclosures were contributing factors to his suspension. Thus, we will proceed to the issue of whether the agency met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same actions in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of whistleblowing, the Board will consider the following factors: The strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing the first factor, the administrative judge found that the agency had "scant reason" for the appellant's one-day suspension. We disagree. The charge against the appellant was supported by 11 specifications, which consisted of statements from emails that the appellant sent to his supervisors and other agency officials during a seven-week period, i.e., from January 28, 2009, through March 16, 2009. Thus, the alleged misconduct in this case was not an isolated incident but, rather, was frequently repeated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the emails at issue, the appellant accused his superiors of lying, being untrustworthy, and engaging in "dirty work" against him. Specifically, in a January 28, 2009 email to his commanding officer, the appellant stated, "You have shown me nothing in a commanding officer I can trust. I do not <span id="Page_3674"></span>trust you." In his March 3, 2009 email to Nanette Nelson, the appellant's first-level supervisor and the proposing official, the appellant accused Ms. Nelson of doing the "dirty (retaliatory) work" of Joseph Tessier, the appellant's second-level supervisor and the deciding official. In other emails, the appellant accused Ms. Nelson of lying about her motives, asserted that her actions were "way over the line," and alleged that Ms. Nelson's superiors had a negative influence on her and that she was "beginning to exhibit the same negative characteristics." Given the tone and content of the appellant's emails, we find that the agency had ample reason to suspend him for one day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the administrative judge based his conclusion to the contrary, at least in part, on his assessment that the appellant "tried to make his points in a courteous way, and to treat with civility management officials he obviously holds in contempt." In our view, however, the appellant's emails do not reflect any effort on his part to be civil or courteous to management officials. We fail to see how accusing his supervisor of doing someone else's dirty work could be deemed anything but rude and disrespectful. While the appellant certainly could have chosen to convey his concerns to management in a courteous or civil manner, he elected not to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also seems to have based his finding that the agency had scant reason to suspend the appellant for one day on his determination that the agency should have taken other steps to address the appellant's misconduct. In that regard, the administrative judge found as follows: "In my mind, a reasonable supervisor in Ms. Nelson's position would likely send a senior civil servant with poor interpersonal skills and ineffective writing skills to remedial training before even contemplating discipline."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility or to decide what penalty it would impose. Rather, the Board must assure that management's judgment has been properly exercised and the penalty selected by the agency does not exceed the maximum limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6; 10 (2004); <span class="Italic">see also Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1252 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Congress has vested discretionary authority in employing agencies to manage their workforces). The Board has long recognized that disrespectful conduct is a proper basis for imposing discipline. The Board has held that disrespect towards supervisors, especially on a continuous basis such as in this case, is a serious offense because it undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee discipline. <span class="Italic">Gaines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 11 (2003). Thus, we find that the agency acted reasonably by suspending the appellant for one day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in concluding that the agency had scant reason for its personnel action, the administrative judge emphasized that the appellant was writing to advise management of perceived fraud, waste, and abuse; not to attack management or otherwise engage in ad hominem attacks. To the extent that the administrative judge found that the appellant's rude and disrespectful emails did not warrant a one-day suspension because the purpose of the emails was to advise management of perceived fraud, waste, and abuse, we disagree. The Federal Circuit has held that the Whistleblower Protection Act is not a "weapon in arguments over policy or a shield for insubordinate conduct" and that "[p]olicymakers and administrators have every right to expect loyal, professional service from subordinates who do not bear the burden of responsibility." <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (2006) ("wrongful or disruptive conduct is not shielded by the presence of a protected disclosure"). Thus, even if the purpose of the emails was to advise management of perceived fraud, waste, and abuse, this purpose is not sufficient to insulate the appellant from discipline for his misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second factor to consider in determining whether the agency met its burden of proof is the strength of any retaliatory motive on the part of the officials who were involved in the decision in question. <span class="Italic">See Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323-24. In this case, the relevant agency officials are Ms. Nelson and Mr. Tessier. The administrative judge made no findings regarding this factor with respect to Mr. Tessier. As for Ms. Nelson, the administrative judge found that she would have had a "powerful motive to retaliate" against the appellant because one of his protected disclosures specifically accused her of pressuring him to rewrite a report to delete references to problems with an aircraft program, and, in essence, accused her of making a false statement regarding her role in the matter. The administrative judge noted that "[t]hese are serious allegations of wrongdoing which, if proven, could warrant Ms. Nelson's own discipline."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that Ms. Nelson may have had a motive to retaliate against the appellant. However, considering the strength of the agency's evidence discussed above, it appears, on balance, that the agency officials' primary motive for issuing the appellant a one-day suspension was their concern over his disrespectful and rude conduct rather than any animus or ill will. Accordingly, we find that any evidence of motive to retaliate on the part of the relevant agency officials does not outweigh the strength of the evidence in support of the agency's suspension decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge made no findings as to the third factor--i.e., whether the agency proved that it would have suspended a similarly-situated, non-whistleblower employee for the same misconduct. There appears to be no evidence that a similarly-situated employee received a lesser penalty for the same misconduct. While the appellant contends that non-whistleblowers were treated differently because one of his co-workers was not disciplined after telling the appellant's third-line supervisor that "the C5 team would not tolerate backstabbers," the non-whistleblower's conduct is not the same as the appellant's because, unlike the appellant, his co-worker made one remark to one person, rather than a series of disrespectful and rude statements to multiple parties. Accordingly, the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is not a significant factor for the Board's analysis in the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Weighing the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors against one another, we find that the agency established by clear and convincing evidence that it would have suspended the appellant for one day notwithstanding his protected disclosures. Although Ms. Nelson had a clear motive to retaliate, the agency had a strong basis to suspend the appellant for one day because of his rude and disrespectful conduct. For these reasons, we reverse the initial decision and deny the appellant's request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duggan v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20180226111">883 F.3d 842</a>, 844, 846-47 (9th Cir. 2018), determined that language was sufficiently intemperate to be unprotected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 14, 2013, Cusi informed the audit team that she, Downer, and other supervisors were focused on providing "guidance on team norms." She added that she was concerned that everyone in the branch should understand "the nuances of being candid and being respectful." Petitioner emailed back, copying the whole team:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your response below is so arrogant and beyond the pale, like telling victims they asked for it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In fact, you were the one who was disrespectful to us by, without provocation or acceptable reason, calling us "unprofessional" multiple times just because we deigned to call you on your rote, poorly reasoned and dangerous mgmt. concepts....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your statement "nuance of being candid" below is just an oxymoron.... Accept your mistakes and learn from them but do not try to disguise them by blaming those who made none.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is just too low to blame the victims for their victimization. So, your response below is again disappointing and insulting, as it is you that need "to improve" your conduct, and change the toxic environment you have created.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We adopt the Federal Circuit's test for determining whether, in a given case, an agency has carried its burden. In <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the court listed three factors to consider: (1) "the strength of the agency's evidence in support of" the action taken; (2) "the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of" the decision-makers; and (3) "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against" similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the proposed 10-day suspension and the resulting performance rating of only "minimally successful" in the area of communication, we also adopt the Federal Circuit's holdings to the effect that an employee may be disciplined for the <span class="Italic">way</span> in which he or she communicates a protected disclosure. That is, an employer is entitled to demand basic civility even in this context. As the Federal Circuit has explained, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2) does not require "that the adverse personnel action be based on facts completely separate and distinct from protected whistleblowing disclosures." <span class="Italic">Watson v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, "wrongful or <span class="Italic">disruptive conduct</span> is not shielded by the presence of a protected disclosure." <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (emphasis added). To be sure, an employer may not punish an employee merely for being blunt or critical of management when making a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1305-06. For that reason, the court in <span class="Italic">Greenspan</span> ruled in favor of the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1299. But the court there declined to consider whether the employee's behavior went beyond blunt to become "disruptive" or "disrespectful," because the agency had not relied on such behavior as a ground for the discipline imposed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1304-05. Finally, we note that the Federal Circuit definitively put to rest Petitioner's argument here, that the manner in which an employee communicates a protected disclosure cannot be disciplined. In <span class="Italic">Kalil v. Department of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071300479f3d82111300">479 F.3d 821</a>, 825 (Fed. Cir. 2007), the court emphasized that <span class="Italic">Greenspan</span> does <span class="Italic">not</span> mean that "once a disclosure qualifies as protected, the character or nature of that disclosure can never supply support for any disciplinary action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next apply the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> standards against that backdrop. Considering the record as a whole, the evidence in support of the personnel actions is strong. Nearly all witnesses other than Petitioner characterized his <span id="Page_3675"></span>behavior at the January 22 meeting as disruptive and disrespectful; indeed, the team could not complete its discussion of the intended topics because of his conduct. And the Board permissibly concluded that the February 14 email conveyed a nasty and condescending tone that went well beyond mere bluntness or a critique of management practices. Accordingly, the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor supports the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Huang v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210115143">844 Fed. Appx. 942</a> (9th Cir. NP), declined to overturn a Board ruling that no whistleblower reprisal occurred when the employee was disciplined for a threat of litigation against the supervisor who issued a PIP to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Huang was placed on two Performance Improvement Plans ("PIPs") in quick succession from 2017 to 2018. During the second PIP, she sent her supervisor Matthew Loghry three emails in which she complained that he was improperly administering her PIP, told Loghry she would be "making a whistleblower complaint," and threatened Loghry to "drop the PIP" or she "will sue" and "more likely than not, I'll win, and you'll get fired." DHS suspended Huang for fourteen days with the specification that her conduct was unbecoming of a law enforcement officer.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing a Board decision concerning a whistleblower retaliation claim, we "must set aside the Board's decision on the merits if it is: '(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.'" <span class="Italic">Duggan v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 883 F.3d 842, 843 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c)). "Substantial evidence in this context is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 846 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;The Board did not err in assessing the strength of the agency's evidence in support of suspension. Huang argues her emails were not sufficiently threatening to warrant a suspension and that the Board reviewed her emails in a vacuum. Our role is not to reweigh the evidence but to assess whether the Board's conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Bieber v. Dep't of Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2002). It was.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All decision-makers for the DHS credibly testified that they believed the email was disruptive and inhibitory to effective workplace management. The abrasive tone of Huang's emails and unmistakable personal threat against Loghry inarguably invite legitimate disciplinary action by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Duggan</span>, 883 F.3d at 846-47 ("[A]n employee may be disciplined for the way in which he or she communicates a protected disclosure....[T]he Board permissibly concluded that the...email conveyed a nasty and condescending tone that went well beyond mere bluntness or a critique of management practices. Accordingly, the first <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor supports the Board's decision." (emphasis omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Huang's attempt to compare her extortionate email--which she warned Loghry not to share with anyone--to an attorney demand letter or settlement offer is farfetched. Huang was attempting to coerce Loghry into dropping the PIP, not because of her own improved performance, but because Loghry should be fearful that she would sue and he would lose his job. She does not explain which public or private right she was attempting to vindicate by complaining to Loghry about his administration of her PIP. Indeed, the Board found her emails to Loghry not even to be legitimate whistleblower complaints, a finding she does not contest. Nor did Huang show that it was a usual or accepted course of conduct at DHS to resolve internal workplace disagreements through furtive, personal threats of litigation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Detrich v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/07-3100.pdf">251 Fed. Appx. 679</a>, 680-81 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), suggested by way of <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that management cannot attempt to completely control channels of communication of protected disclosures and discipline individuals who fail to follow the reporting chain of command. One charge in <span class="Italic">Detrich</span> was "failure to follow instructions/inappropriate conduct for sending e-mails containing allegations of abusive treatment by management outside of the chain of command and in violation of an established e-mail policy." Although the point was not preserved for a dispositive holding by the appellate court, the circuit panel noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We have substantial doubt as to the validity of that policy under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.) ("WPA"). The WPA does not permit an agency to discipline an employee for disclosing protected information merely because that information has been reported outside the chain of command. An agency cannot require that protected disclosures be made only to supervisory personnel. <span class="Italic">See Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The balance between workplace harmony and spirited dissent is a difficult one that allows for a degree of flagrancy--but not too much--if an employee is to avoid discipline for even arguably protected speech and conduct.
