<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-110"><span class="space">4.</span> Law of the Case; Mandate Rule</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">One more litigation or issue preclusion doctrine that occasionally crops up in Board litigation is the "law of the case." The notion is that when, in the course of an appeal or some component of an appeal, the Board makes a decision on a particular issue, e.g., the manner that overtime earnings will be calculated as to a back pay obligation, the Board will not revisit the issue later in the course of the same proceeding. The doctrine is intended to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing case. <span class="Italic">Mangano v. VA</span>, 109 MSPR 658, 668-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24, 2008 MSPB 202 (2008) ("[A]n administrative judge is required to follow the Board's remand instructions."). The law of the case means, in essence, that the disposition of an issue in an appeal remains the disposition throughout the case at the level that the issue was decided. Avoided is constant reexamination of the issue through repeated direct or indirect requests for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. DOJ</span>, 92 MSPR 176, 180 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (stating the rule and exceptions: new and substantially different evidence, and a contrary decision by the controlling authority, showing prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 425, 426 (1998) ("The law of the case doctrine was developed to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing legal proceeding."); <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 235, 240 (1997) ("Under the law of the case doctrine, a tribunal will not reconsider issues that have already been decided in an appeal, unless there is new and material evidence adduced at a subsequent trial, controlling authority has made a contrary decision of law, or the prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice."); <span class="Italic">Normoyle v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 65 MSPR 80, 82 n.2 (1994) (referring to Moore's Federal Practice &#x00B6; 0.404[1] (2d ed. 1993): "a decision on an issue of law made at one stage of a case becomes a binding precedent to be followed in successive stages of the same litigation"); <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 53 MSPR 78, 81 (1992) ("Under the 'law of the case' doctrine, we will not reopen what has been previously decided in this case.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The law of the case doctrine was summarized, <span class="Italic">MacLean v. DHS,</span> 116 MSPR 562, 569-70 &#x00B6; 16, 2011 MSPB 70 (2011) (vacated and remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">MacLean v. DHS</span>, 714 F.3d 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2013), <span class="Italic">circuit decision aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">DHS v. MacLean</span>, 135 S. Ct. 913 (2015)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law of the case doctrine refers to the practice of courts in refusing to reopen what already has been decided in an appeal, and of following a prior decision in an appeal of the same case. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 552 (1993). These rules do not involve preclusion by final judgment, but instead regulate judicial affairs before final judgment. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 339 (1995). There are three recognized exceptions to the law of the case doctrine: The availability of new and substantially different evidence; a contrary decision of law by controlling authority that is applicable to the question at issue; or a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">Hudson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge's determination that a manifest injustice would result if the reasonableness of the penalty were not reexamined in light of this new information. If the Board were to refuse to consider this information, it would in effect be rewarding the agency for incorrectly stating that Mr. McCainey was not a suitable comparator because he had not been convicted, and for failing to produce evidence that is plainly material to the reasonableness of the penalty until late in the proceedings.

In fact, OPM failed to challenge the administrative judge's finding by filing a petition for review of the initial decision.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his cross petition for review, the appellant requests that the Board reconsider its finding that the agency proved the requisite nexus between disciplinary action against him and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Doe,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6; 13. In response, the agency argues that the law of the case doctrine precludes the appellant from re-litigating the issue of nexus, and that the appellant's so-called cross petition for review is actually a motion for reconsideration of the Board's earlier decision, which the Board lacks the authority to consider.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the law of the case doctrine does preclude us from reconsidering the appellant's arguments concerning whether the agency established a nexus between disciplinary action against him and the efficiency of the service. The law of the case doctrine was developed to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing lawsuit; it thus regulates judicial affairs before final judgment, not preclusion by final judgment. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 339 (1995).

Nonetheless, there are three recognized exceptions to the law of the case doctrine: (1) the availability of new and substantially different evidence; (2) a contrary decision of law by controlling authority that is applicable to the question at issue; and (3) a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice. <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 553 (1993). In his cross petition for review, the appellant has produced no new and substantially different evidence bearing on the issue of nexus, and he has cited no contrary decision of law by controlling authority that is applicable to the issue. Further, the appellant has not shown that the Board's prior decision in this case was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice, which requires a showing of "exceptional circumstances," <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> "clear error" that convinces the adjudicating tribunal that the prior decision was in error. <span class="Italic">Dow,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 10.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he law of the case doctrine refers to the practice of courts in refusing to reopen what has been decided and of following a prior decision in an appeal of the same case.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have already noted the lack of new evidence relating to the laches issue. Further, there has been no contrary decision of law regarding laches. Nor is there a showing that the Federal Circuit's decision on laches is clearly erroneous or would work a manifest injustice. In practice, although courts often refer to the manifest injustice exception, that exception is rarely invoked. 18 Wright, Miller &#x0026; Cooper, <span class="Italic">id</span>., 4478. Courts have consistently held that disregarding the law of the case under the manifest injustice standard requires "exceptional circumstances." <span class="Italic">See</span> e.g., <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 740 F.2d 1071, 1082-83 (D.C. Cir. 1984).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we entertained the agency's argument that it would suffer economic prejudice as a result of the back pay award to the appellant, such argument is not sufficiently persuasive to show error or manifest injustice in declining to bar the enforcement petition by laches. The Federal Circuit considered whether entitlement to back pay shows economic prejudice in the laches context in a case involving an alleged wrongful discharge of a military officer and rejected that argument on a number of grounds, noting, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "if back pay constitutes prejudice then virtually every suit could be said to be presumptively 'prejudicial' because most successful military claimants receive back pay." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cornetta v. United States</span>, 851 F.2d at 1381. As in <span class="Italic">Cornetta</span>, in the civilian context, the sovereign has consented to be sued and to award back pay, 5 USC 5596; claimants must be reimbursed for damages they have sustained. Although there is no definitive precedent specifically finding no economic prejudice in awarding civilian employees back pay, there is no reason to conclude that the result would not be similar to that in <span class="Italic">Cornetta</span> if the matter were litigated. In any event, in accordance with the mandate rule, we follow the Federal Circuit's remand order to decide <span id="Page_1547"></span>the instant petition on its merits, and we decline to consider the agency's new theory of laches.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;It has been held, without specific mention of the law of case doctrine, that where an argument could have been raised on an initial appeal, it is inappropriate to consider that argument on a second appeal following remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Northwestern Indiana Telephone Co., Inc. v.

According to the court, "This widely-accepted rule furthers the important value of procedural efficiency, 18 C. Wright and A. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE &#x0026; PROCEDURE 4478 (1981), and prevents the 'bizarre result' that 'a party who has chosen not to argue a point on a first appeal should stand better as regards the law of the case than one who argued and lost,'" <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Laffey v.

Similarly, we find that it would be inappropriate to consider the agency's new argument regarding laches here when it has already lost on that matter. The agency could have, and should have raised its theory of economic prejudice in the first court proceeding; rather, it chose to argue only defense prejudice. In effect, the agency has waived its right to advance its new legal theory.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The mandate rule or law of the case doctrine was noted in <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant previously filed a petition for review in which she successfully argued that she performed active duty for other than training purposes beginning on November 21, 1990. The Board remanded the appeal for a finding on whether the appellant met the minimum service requirement for preference eligibility or was exempt from it. 105 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15. As the appellant observes in her reopening request, on remand the AJ again found that all of the appellant's active military duty was for training. Under the "mandate rule," however, a lower court has no power to deviate from the instructions of its reviewing appellate court. <span class="Italic">Briggs v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,</span> 334 U.S. 304, 306 (1948). Likewise, an AJ has no power to deviate from the instructions of the full Board. <span class="Italic">Roach v. Department of the Army,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 14 (2000); <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 670, 677 (1994). A variation on the mandate rule is the law of the case doctrine, which holds that an AJ is bound by the findings and conclusions of the full Board in an earlier phase of ongoing litigation. It is error for an AJ to make findings and conclusions that are inconsistent with the law of the case. <span class="Italic">Timmers v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 10 (2007); <span class="Italic">Pawn v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, where, as here, the appellant has established a key element of her case to the satisfaction of the full Board, she should not be forced to file a second petition for review with the Board to reargue the very same point. The AJ's failure to adhere to the Board's decision remanding this appeal contravened the appellant's "basic procedural rights," and accordingly, reopening is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Cf. Sellers v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6; 7 (2004) (despite the untimeliness of the appellant's petition for review, the Board reopened the appeal to prevent manifest injustice because an error below concerning the appellant's preference eligible status adversely affected his "basic procedural rights").</p>
