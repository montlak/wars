<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-116"><span class="space">b.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Nolo Contendere</span></span> and <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Alford</span></span> Pleas</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In criminal cases a defendant may plead <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> (no contest) to charges, meaning that the individual denies the factual specifications but accepts legal responsibility for the charge. Alternatively, the individual pleads guilty without admitting or obtaining a finding as to the underlying facts, a procedure described in <span class="Italic">North Carolina v. Alford</span>, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). Under <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, there appears to be no distinction between a plea of <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> and a guilty plea, 400 U.S. at 37:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can we perceive any material difference between a plea that refuses to admit commission of the criminal act and a plea containing a protestation of innocence when, as in the instant case, a defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has had some difficulty determining and describing how a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> or <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea will collaterally estop an employee from contesting adverse action charges paralleling the criminal charges leading to the plea.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Faucher v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 203, 206-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-10, 17, 19 (2004), considered an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea and examined the evidence (or quality of admissions) received by the state court judge. The record assembled in state court did not support a conclusion that the appellant admitted the misconduct; it was more as though he acknowledged the existence of the criminal charges. The discharge was sustained based on other evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition, the agency asserts that the administrative judge erred by failing to follow the Board's guidance regarding the application of collateral estoppel as it applies to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea in practice before the Board. In <span class="Italic">North Carolina v. Alford</span>, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed.2d 162 (1970), the Supreme Court found that the express admission of guilt following a criminal indictment is not a constitutional requisite to the imposition of a criminal penalty and that an individual accused of a crime may voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent to the imposition of a prison sentence, even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in acts constituting a crime<span class="Italic">. Alford</span>, 400 U.S. at 37, 91 S. Ct. 160. Thus, the Court allowed as constitutional guilty pleas coupled with claims of innocence. Such pleas are generally referred to as <span class="Italic">Alford</span> pleas. The Board has held that an appellant charged with a crime for which he was prosecuted and convicted pursuant to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, despite his claim of innocence, may be collaterally estopped from denying in the course of his Board appeal that he is guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted<span class="Italic">. Loveland v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 484, 490 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, the principle of collateral estoppel does not preclude the appellant from denying his guilt because the record shows that he was not convicted of any crime. Massachusetts charged the appellant with indecent [assault and battery] on a person 14 or over. The appellant entered an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea that was accepted by the criminal court. As noted above, in accepting the appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea on August 29, 2001, the court noted that the criminal count against the appellant was continued without a finding until March 22, 2002, and specified the conditions of probation imposed on the appellant. Those conditions were that the appellant was to submit to an evaluation to determine if sex offender counseling is appropriate. If the evaluation determines it is not then no counseling is necessary. There is no indication in the record before the Board that the appellant failed to meet the conditions of his probation or that the court ever convicted the appellant based on his <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea. Absent such a conviction, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant was not collaterally estopped from denying the allegations against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent application of the principle of collateral estoppel to the facts of this case, the agency's case rests on the relative credibility of the appellant and Ms. Reynolds. There were no witnesses to the instances of misconduct charged by the agency except the appellant and Ms. Reynolds. In short, Ms. Reynolds stated that the appellant committed the misconduct and he denied that he did so. Thus, this appeal can be correctly characterized as a he-said/she-said case<span class="Italic">. See Vicente v. Department of the Army</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 80 &#x00B6; 7 (2000). Thus, the resolution of this case depends on an assessment of the appellant's and Ms. Reynolds' relative credibility<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To resolve credibility issues, the trier of fact identifies the factual questions in dispute, summarizes the evidence on each disputed question, states which version he believes, and explains in detail why he found the chosen version more credible, considering such factors as: (1) the witness' opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness' character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement by the witness; (4) a witness' bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness' version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness' version of events; and (7) the witness' demeanor<span class="Italic">.

The Board itself has stated a similar rule, namely, that it does not owe deference to the administrative judge's credibility determination where his findings are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's Alford plea is not a significant factor in assessing the appellant's credibility</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that, even if the appellant was not collaterally estopped by reason of his <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea from denying his misconduct before the Board, the administrative judge improperly weighed the fact of the appellant's guilty plea. We therefore have considered whether the administrative judge gave insufficient weight to the appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea as a <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> factor. In <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 400 U.S. at 38, 91 S. Ct. 160, the Court cautioned that pleas coupled with claims of innocence should not be accepted unless there is a factual basis for the pleas...and until the judge taking the plea has inquired into and sought to resolve the conflict between the waiver of trial and the claim of innocence<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 38 n.10, 91 S. Ct. 160. The Court noted further that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly provide that a court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. (citations omitted). Massachusetts rules provide similarly that a judge shall not accept a plea of guilty, unless he is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the charge<span class="Italic">. Aetna Casualty &#x0026; Surety Company v. Niziolek</span>, 481 N.E.2d 1356, 1364 n.7 (1985). However, while the Massachusetts judge taking the plea must satisfy himself that there is a factual basis for a charge, he need not find that the defendant actually committed the crime to which he is pleading guilty<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1364; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Commonwealth v. Green</span>, 750 N.E.2d 1041, 1043 (2001) (the judge allowed Green to enter an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea to each of the charges, whereby he admitted only that the Commonwealth could prove the offenses charged beyond a reasonable doubt); <span class="Italic">Commonwealth v.

App.Ct. 907 748 N.E.2d 982, 984 n.1 (2001) (before accepting an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, the trial judge should be sure that the defendant intelligently concludes that his interests require entry of a guilty plea and that the record before the judge contains strong evidence of actual guilt), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 434 Mass. 1108, 757 N.E.2d 729 (Mass. 2001) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the court in <span class="Italic">Aetna</span> stated that a defendant's guilty plea and any other admissions made during the plea-taking colloquy with the judge are admissible as evidence in subsequent civil litigation<span class="Italic">. Aetna v. Niziolek</span>, 481 N.E.2d at 1364. In this case, because of its he-said/she-said nature, the appellant's admissions and the court's evidentiary basis for accepting the <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea appear to amount to no more than recognizing the existence of Ms. Reynolds' accusations. There is no evidence that the court heard additional evidence or made any additional findings. Further, there is no evidence that the appellant made any other admissions regarding the facts underlying the criminal charge. Thus, evaluating the appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea under the <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> factors, it is not a prior inconsistent statement as to his version of what happened between him and Ms. Reynolds or evidence contradicting the version of events that he presented at the hearing. Under the circumstances of this case, the appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea is not a significant factor in assessing his credibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, as we have found above, the appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea in court regarding the criminal charges that were brought against him is not a significant factor in assessing his credibility, we take into account the appellant's decision to enter the plea rather than to face a possible guilty verdict for the same conduct which is at issue in this appeal. The administrative judge's credibility determination erroneously failed to discuss this and the other significant evidence relevant to a <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> determination in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's misconduct was serious and repeated, and he was on notice that the agency had a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment. The appellant's misconduct is particularly egregious because he was an informal supervisor to Ms. Reynolds, who was only 20 years of age at the time of the misconduct, and he occupied a position of trust when he was working with her<span class="Italic">. See Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 425, 433 (1994) (agencies are entitled to hold supervisors to a higher standard of conduct than non-supervisors because supervisors occupy positions of trust and responsibility). Moreover, the appellant's misconduct became a matter of public record through the criminal action against him. Additionally, the appellant's denial of the charges against him reveals no potential for rehabilitation. Although the appellant has five years of <span id="Page_1554"></span>service and no prior disciplinary record, we find that these mitigating factors do not outweigh the seriousness of the aggravating factors. We find that the agency considered all the relevant factors, exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness, and properly imposed the penalty of removal for the sustained offenses<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. DOJ</span>, 5 MSPR 77, 82 n.5, 5 MSPB 150 (1981), a border patrol agent was suspended after he entered a no contest plea to charges of off-duty disorderly conduct and trespass. Under the conditions of his plea, the criminal charges and plea were deferred for six months. At that time, the charges would be dismissed if there were no intervening similar charges or incidents. Concerning the effect of the plea on the agency's burden of proof of the underlying misconduct, the Board noted a lack of correspondence between what was covered in the no contest plea and the specification in the adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...But because a plea of no contest was accepted on the trespassing and disorderly conduct charges, there has never been proof of the allegations of drinking mentioned in the sheriffs report. The no contest plea entered by the employee on the trespassing and disorderly conduct charges does not bind him in this case.

The convictions were the result of <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> pleas. The Board determined that if the charges against the appellant were based on the convictions resulting from the plea rather than on the underlying misconduct, the plea in criminal court would estop the appellant from contesting the conviction before the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our view, the clear weight of authority provides that there is no valid distinction between a conviction upon a plea of nolo contendere and a conviction after a guilty plea at trial, where the basis of the agency action is the uncontested conviction and not any admission of the underlying conduct implied by the plea. Therefore, a conviction as the result of a nolo plea stands on the same footing as any other conviction with regard to its use in subsequent proceedings....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board next addressed <span class="Italic">nolo</span> pleas in the <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> litigation, leading to a change in the law. Crofoot pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false pretenses after the appellant was indicted for the felony of defrauding the government concerning an alleged on-the-job injury. The agency's parallel adverse action charges specified the underlying conduct of the criminal action and charged Crofoot with falsification and also with notoriously disgraceful conduct based on his indictment and guilty plea to the misdemeanor. <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 21 MSPR 248, 250-53 (1984) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 761 F.2d 661 (Fed.

GPO</span>, 823 F.2d 495, 498 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>) (MSPB decision partially overruled or modified by <span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 484 (1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>), rebuffed the agency's attempt to estop Crofoot from litigating the falsification charge, concluding that the factual basis recited by Crofoot as a condition of acceptance of his plea by the criminal court did not establish a basis for estopping Crofoot from forcing the agency to its burden of proof. The Board sustained Crofoot's removal on the basis of the charge of disgraceful conduct that was based on his indictment and conviction. As to Crofoot's ability to contest the factual basis of the falsification charge, the Board reasoned that "[s]ince no factual determination on the underlying conduct has been made, the issue has not been actually litigated and collateral estoppel does not prevent appellant from litigating the issue in a subsequent action":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was removed from his position of Photocomposition Keyboard Operator based upon charges of failing to report for duty without prior approval and without an excuse acceptable to supervisors, notoriously disgraceful conduct, and falsehood. With respect to the unexcused absence charge, the agency specified eighteen instances of unapproved leave. With respect to the notoriously disgraceful conduct charge, the agency specified that appellant was indicted for the felony of defrauding the government concerning an alleged on-the-job injury, that the trial resulted in a "hung jury," and that appellant then agreed during plea bargaining negotiations to plead guilty to the misdemeanor charge of false pretenses. The agency's falsehood charge essentially specified the underlying conduct of the criminal action. In this regard, the agency specified that appellant claimed an on-the-job injury and was placed in sick injured administrative leave, but an investigation revealed that appellant was not at work when he sustained the injury. The agency also specified that appellant pled guilty to a misdemeanor for this action. Appellant appealed the removal action to the Board's Washington, D.C. Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the presiding official found that the agency proved the unauthorized absence and notorious conduct charges. With respect to the falsification charge, the presiding official found that appellant was collaterally estopped from denying his culpability for this offense because of his guilty plea in the prior criminal proceeding. The presiding official, therefore, found that the agency also proved this charge. The presiding official then found that a nexus exists between the sustained charges and the efficiency of the service, and that the removal penalty did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness. The presiding official, therefore, sustained the agency action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant contends that he is not collaterally estopped from denying the falsification charge. Appellant also asserts that the agency did not establish a nexus between his misdemeanor conviction and the efficiency of the service, and that the agency lacks authority to discharge an employee for alleged abuse of compensation law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a judgment on the merits in one suit precludes the relitigation of the same issues in a second suit, regardless of whether the two suits were based on the same cause of action, if certain requirements are met. First, the issue in the second suit must be identical to the issue in the prior action. Second, the issue must have actually been litigated in the prior action. Third, the determination in the prior action must have been necessary to the resulting judgment. <span class="Italic">See Chisholm v. Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Agency,</span> 656 F.2d 42 (3rd Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Payer v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the</span> Army, 19 MSPR 534 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that the requirement that the issue must have actually been litigated in the prior action has not been met in this case because of the nature of his plea in the prior criminal proceeding. Appellant pled guilty under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">North Carolina v.</span> <span class="Italic">Alford,</span> 400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed.2d 162 (1970), under which the defendant denies the relevant facts of the offense but agrees to accept legal responsibility in order to avoid the risk of a more severe penalty. Under this plea, the trial court does not make factual findings but merely imposes a sentence after finding a factual basis for the plea. <span class="Italic">See Alford, supra.</span> Appellant asserts that an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea is analogous to a plea of <span class="Italic">nolo contenders</span> and that both pleas do not estop a subsequent denial since no facts are actually litigated in the previous criminal proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The actual litigation requirement means that the issue must have been contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court. <span class="Italic">See Otherson v. Department of Justice,</span> 711 F.2d 267, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In <span class="Italic">Otherson,</span> the court applied this rule to the appellant's criminal conviction upon a stipulated record. The appellant and the prosecutor had agreed, following a mistrial on a felony charge, to proceed without a jury on a lesser misdemeanor charge on the basis of the stipulation that certain witnesses would testify as they had at the felony trial. The court noted the general rule that when a particular fact is established not by judicial resolution but by stipulation of the parties, that fact has not been actually litigated for purposes of collateral estoppel unless the stipulation clearly manifests the parties intent to be bound in future actions. The court found, however, that since appellant only stipulated what certain testimony would be, and not what the ultimate facts were, the trial judge was left the responsibility to evaluate the testimony and determine whether the government established its case. Thus, the underlying facts were subject to a judicial determination and the charge was, therefore, actually litigated for collateral estoppel purposes, despite the absence of a hearing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 274-75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the issue of whether appellant committed the acts which were the basis of the falsification charge was not contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court. Under appellant's <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, he maintained his innocence and the judge imposed a sentence without making a factual determination on the underlying conduct.[1] Since no factual determination on the underlying conduct has been made, the issue has not been actually litigated and collateral estoppel does not prevent appellant from litigating the issue in a subsequent action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The judge, however, first determined that a factual basis existed for the plea. A factual basis, however, is not a judicial determination upon the issue, but merely an evaluation of the evidence to ensure that the defendant is making a free and intelligent choice in entering the plea. Absent a factual basis, the judge should not accept the plea. <span class="Italic">See Alford, supra,</span> at 38, 38 n.10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is also consistent with previous Board decisions on the issue of collateral estoppel. For example, the Board cited to <span class="Italic">Alford, supra,</span> in stating that the appellant's no contest plea in the previous criminal proceeding did not bind him in the subsequent Board proceeding. The Board noted that the no contest plea was an implied admission of the offense for the purpose of that proceeding only. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 MSPB 150, 152 n.5 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the Board has held in another case that convictions based upon pleas of <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> are entitled to collateral estoppel effect in later Board proceedings, the effect is limited to cases where the basis of <span id="Page_1555"></span>the agency action is the uncontested conviction and not any admission of the underlying conduct implied by the plea. <span class="Italic">Bryant v. United States Postal Service,</span> 12 MSPB 282 at 283 (1982). In the present case, the agency has based the falsification charge on the underlying conduct and not upon the conviction. Thus under <span class="Italic">Bryant</span>, the prior <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea conviction is not entitled to collateral estoppel effect as to the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, resolution of the present case is consistent with the Board's recent holding in <span class="Italic">Payer v. Department of the Army,</span> 19 MSPR 534 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Payer,</span> the Board held that the actual litigation requirement is satisfied if the issues clearly constituted matters in issue or points controverted, upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered. In that case, the presiding official based his decision in the first action upon a documentary record rather than a hearing. The presiding official, however, made a determination on the contested issues based upon the record before him and, therefore, satisfied the actual litigation requirement. <span class="Italic">See Otherson, supra; McCord v. Bailey,</span> 636 F.2d 606 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (hearing not required to be held for collateral estoppel to apply where the hearing would serve no purpose). As stated earlier, the prior verdict in the present case was not rendered upon matters in issue or points controverted since the judge made no judicial determination on whether appellant committed the conduct charged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Crofoot appealed to the Federal Circuit, arguing that his conviction did not establish notoriously disgraceful conduct. In <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 761 F.2d 661, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal Circuit injected its views concerning <span class="Italic">nolo</span> pleas and remanded the appeal to the Board for additional consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although there is a dearth of case law which delineates the collateral consequences of a conviction pursuant to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, we think that at least the same consequences should attach to such a conviction as to a conviction under a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea, considered analogous to the <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea by the Supreme Court.... In an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, as in a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea, the defendant "voluntarily, knowingly, and understandingly consent[s] to the imposition of a [criminal penalty] even if he is unwilling or unable to admit his participation in the acts constituting the crime."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several courts have held that the fact of a <span class="Italic">conviction</span> pursuant to a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea gives rise to a variety of collateral consequences in subsequent proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Qureshi v. INS</span>, 519 F.2d 1174 (5th Cir. 1975) (<span class="Italic">nolo</span> conviction as basis for deportation of aliens); <span class="Italic">Sakoloff v. Saxbe</span>, 501 F.2d 571 (2d Cir. 1974) (<span class="Italic">nolo</span> conviction as grounds for revocation of physician's certification of registration to distribute regulated drugs); <span class="Italic">George v. Black</span>, 732 F.2d 108, 110 (8th Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">nolo</span> conviction as grounds for conducting a civil health commitment proceeding)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At note 1 of its opinion, the court ventured to suggest that "an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea of guilty might arguably warrant more severe collateral consequences than a <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> plea, because a court that receives the former, but not the latter, must independently determine that the plea has a factual basis."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board was left with the task of determining the consequences of Crofoot's plea as to the disgraceful conduct charge, <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 31 MSPR 442, 445 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further disagree with appellant's assertion that it is improper to draw an inference of untrustworthiness or dishonesty from his plea and conviction because of the nature of the plea. In <span class="Italic">Bryant v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPB 282, 14 MSPR 109 (1982), the Board found that convictions based upon a plea of <span class="Italic">nolo</span> <span class="Italic">contendere</span> stand on the same footing as any other conviction with regard to later proceedings and that such a conviction alone can justify a loss of confidence in an employee's trustworthiness....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...finding of untrustworthiness is...warranted in the present case for the following reasons: (1) a plea of <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> is similar to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea; (2) appellant was convicted for an offense involving dishonesty; (3) appellant's conviction arose from his employment at the agency; and (4) the agency expressed a legitimate concern that it could no longer trust appellant because of his conviction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once again into court and Crofoot's removal was affirmed. On the recurrent issue of the effect of an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, the court determined in <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 823 F.2d 495, 498 (Fed. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The <span class="Italic">Alford</span> doctrine allows a defendant to plead guilty to a crime without admitting that he engaged in the conduct that forms the basis for the conviction. "An <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea[, however,] is a guilty plea"...and may appropriately be considered by the agency in its determination to remove an employee. [citing <span class="Italic">Graybill</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circuit in which the petitioner was convicted requires that the court find that there is a "high probability" that the defendant has committed the underlying offense before it may accept an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea.... In light of this requirement, the fact that the petitioner was convicted of the crime of false pretenses following an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea could reasonably cause the agency to lose confidence in the petitioner's trustworthiness and to conclude that his removal would promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result, under the <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> series, was that a conviction resulting from an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea could support adverse action, depending on the crime and the nexus between the crime, the conviction, and the appellant's position or the efficiency of agency operations. As to the nature of the proceeding leading to a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea, <span class="Italic">Parrish v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 459, 463 n.4 (1982), suggested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board finds that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is applicable to the criminal charges so that appellant, by his prior criminal conviction, may not deny the charge upon which the agency's adverse action is based. <span class="Italic">See Chisholm, supra.</span> Inasmuch as appellant was found guilty on a plea of <span class="Italic">nolo contendere</span> so that no trial transcript, evidence or pleadings exist which would clarify that the charge on which he was removed was in fact litigated and necessarily decided adversely to him in the criminal prosecution, the agency's extrinsic evidence of the criminal conviction presented to the presiding official constituted a sufficient and adequate record of the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During the years that the court and the Board were considering Crofoot's removal, the court decided <span class="Italic">Graybill v. USPS</span>, 782 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1986), involving the removal of an employee who entered a guilty plea to several counts of criminal child abuse and of engaging in sexual intercourse with a minor. As to Graybill's argument that he should have been allowed to prove his innocence of the criminal charges to the Board, the court decided that state law is to be examined to determine the preclusive effect of a state criminal conviction. The court concluded that state law permitted collateral estoppel to be applied in a civil proceeding following a criminal conviction and that the elements were met to permit estoppel to be applied against Graybill.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The effect of a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea was also explored in <span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 484, 490-91 (1987), involving removal of an employee who entered a guilty plea to a charge of misdemeanor theft of government property in the amount of $100 or less. The civil service charges against the employee were submitting a false claim to the government of approximately $10,500 and making false statements concerning matters under official investigation. The Board implied that the distinction between a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> and a guilty plea was heading toward extinction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel, the <span class="Italic">Graybill</span> court refused to distinguish between an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea and a regular guilty plea containing an express admission of guilt. 782 F.2d at 1573 n.1. Further, in light of <span class="Italic">Alford,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Ashe v. Swenson</span>, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S. Ct. 1189, 25 L. Ed.2d 469 (1970), it rejected Graybill's arguments that it would be fundamentally unfair to allow for use of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in this case. In <span class="Italic">Ashe,</span> 397 U.S. at 444, 90 S. Ct. at 1194, the Supreme Court noted that "[T]he federal decisions have made clear that the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Federal Circuit, thus, has yet to expressly overrule the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> not to afford collateral estoppel effect to <span class="Italic">Alford</span> pleas, it has, in its own <span class="Italic">Crofoot</span> decision and in <span class="Italic">Graybill,</span> progressively narrowed the distinction between <span class="Italic">Alford</span> pleas and regular guilty pleas--containing clear admissions of guilt--for purposes of applying that doctrine. The generally accepted rule is that a judgment of conviction, based upon a plea of guilty, "is conclusive in a civil suit...of all the issues that would have been determined by a conviction after a contested trial."[5]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold, therefore, that an appellant before the Board may be collaterally estopped from denying that he is guilty of <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">crimes for which he was convicted</span> pursuant to an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea.[6] As emphasized, however, we hold that the appellant may be precluded from denying only the offenses for which he accepted legal responsibility under the <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, and may not be precluded from denying the more serious offenses with which he may have been charged or at least threatened, the avoidance of which motivated his plea to the lesser charge.[7]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Raymond v. Department of the Army,</span> 34 MSPR 476 (1987), in which the Board upheld an administrative judge's decision to afford collateral estoppel effect to an appellant's plea-bargained guilty plea on a misdemeanor charge. The Board required, however, that the agency prove by preponderant evidence its more serious allegations against the appellant, which had previously been the basis of the felony charge that the appellant ultimately avoided by means of the plea bargain. There, the Board held that the appellant was not estopped from denying the agency's more serious allegations against him since he had not pleaded guilty to them and they thus were not "actually litigated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 479. Because the appellant's guilty plea in that case was not coupled with his protestation of innocence of the charges, it was not technically an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 481 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that the appellant's conviction on the charge of misdemeanor theft (conversion by false pretenses) of government property worth $100 or less, based on his <span class="Italic">Alford-</span>type plea, is not entitled to collateral estoppel effect as to the more serious misconduct--never <span id="Page_1556"></span>"actually litigated" at trial or by guilty plea--alleged in the agency's notice of proposed removal, namely submitting false claims against the Federal government in the amount of $10,000, and making false statements concerning matters under official investigation. Consequently, we also find that the administrative judge erred in holding that the appellant was precluded from denying his guilt as to those graver charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet there remained a vestigial distinction between the <span class="Italic">nolo</span> and guilty plea, and that distinction will depend on the meaning of a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea under state law. If the agency bases its removal on a loss of trust based on a guilty plea when, in fact, a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea was entered, the agency cannot sustain its charge when the two pleas have different implications under state law. In <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Dept. of Army</span>, 61 MSPR 426, 429-30 (1994), the employee pleaded <span class="Italic">nolo</span> to three drug-related felony charges. He was then removed from his job as a lock and dam operator based on the charge of loss of trust in his ability to perform his job by reason of his guilty plea to three felony criminal charges. Because of the distinctions in state law between a guilty and a <span class="Italic">nolo</span> plea, the Board could not affirm the removal based on an inference drawn from a plea that was mistakenly characterized by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the charge at issue requires the agency to prove that it lost trust in the appellant's ability to perform his job due to his guilty pleas. Both the structure and language of the notice of proposed removal indicate that the appellant's guilty pleas were critical components of the charge. As quoted earlier, the agency specifically stated that it was proposing the appellant's removal because his guilty pleas caused it to lose trust in his ability to perform his duties. Thus, the stated charge did not simply refer to a general loss of trust due to any criminal activity or conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the reasons and circumstances included in the notice to support the charge repeatedly refer to the appellant's guilty pleas as the basis for its loss of trust. In this regard, the notice states that the appellant's "guilty plea indicates...that you cannot be trusted to exercise good judgement," and that the agency "cannot trust any individual who has pled guilty to three felony charges with the operation of a lock and dam." We, therefore, conclude that this charge requires the agency to prove that the appellant pled guilty to the stated criminal charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 415, 417-20 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that proof that the appellant pled nolo contendere does not satisfy the agency's burden. Both state and Board law recognize a distinction between the two pleas. Oklahoma law enumerates four kinds of pleas to an indictment or information--guilty, not guilty, nolo contendere, and a formal judgment of conviction or acquittal of the offense charged which is specially pleaded either with or without the plea of not guilty. 22 Okla. Stat. Ann. &#x00A7; 513 (1993). Thus, a plea of nolo contendere is not equivalent to a guilty plea.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we find that the initial decision's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bryant v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 12 MSPB 282, 14 MSPR 109, 111 n.2 (1982), for the proposition that a nolo contendere conviction stands on the same footing as any other conviction with regard to use in subsequent pleadings, is misplaced. That precedent speaks only to convictions that result from guilty pleas as compared to convictions that result from nolo contendere pleas. It does not address the similarities or differences between the pleas themselves as distinct from any convictions that might be later entered by a court. Moreover, Oklahoma law does not <span class="Italic">see</span> these two pleas as the same because a plea of nolo contendere does not admit guilt. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Oklahoma</span>, 744 P.2d 1280 (Okla. Crim. App. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision also incorrectly concludes that a conviction was entered against the appellant, and that the conviction was the basis of the agency's charge. As discussed above, the agency charged that the appellant's conduct in "pleading guilty" was the basis for its losing trust in him. In no way did the proposal letter charge the appellant with being "convicted." Although the deciding official apparently inadvertently referred to the appellant's "conviction," that was not a part of the agency's charge, and we do not accept it as part of the charge. Moreover, the appellant has not been "convicted" of anything. After his nolo contendere plea was accepted by the court, the appellant was placed into a deferred adjudication program that will result in no conviction ever being entered into his record if he successfully completes his rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that the agency is required to prove that the appellant pled guilty, because its charge is based upon the fact of the pleas, rather than the effect of the pleas or the underlying misconduct, and the record establishes that the appellant pled nolo contendere, as opposed to guilty, to the criminal charges at issue, we conclude that the agency has failed to meet its burden of proof. Thus, the charge against the appellant cannot be sustained.</p>
