<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-116"><span class="space">9.</span> Disciplinary Cases</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 37 FLRA 1346, 1361-65 (1990), considered the negotiability of a proposal that management furnish the union with copies of the notice of proposed action, the final action taken, and the decision in any subsequent appeal, even when the union was not designated as a representative in a disciplinary action. The contract proposal included a statement that the information would be treated as sensitive and that it would be used only for purposes authorized by the contract and the Reform Act. Under the proposal, the union would provide the employer with a list of representatives designated to receive the notices. The proposal was nonnegotiable because it compromised privacy interests of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The provision does not provide for the information to be sanitized in any way, either by removing the names of the affected employees or omitting any other identifying material....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has found that the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, generally prohibits disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent....&#8197;However, the Privacy Act's bar to disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of such information is required by...FOIA. Under the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552, information must be disclosed unless it falls within one of the enumerated exceptions. Of relevance here is exemption (b)(6), which authorizes withholding information in "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 USC 552(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether requested information is exempt from disclosure...an individual's right to privacy must be balanced against the public interest in having the information disclosed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the balancing test here, we find that employees' privacy interests outweigh the public interest in disclosure. Consequently, disclosure of the information would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of the employees' personal privacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, there are few workplace matters that evoke such significant privacy interests as disciplinary and adverse actions that are proposed to be taken, or are taken, against employees. These actions generally connote negative conduct or performance on the part of an employee. The personal embarrassment as well as the stigmatizing effect these actions have must be weighed heavily in assessing the employee's privacy interest. Even if the disciplinary or adverse action does not proceed beyond the proposed stage, the employee's name has been connected with some alleged deficiency or wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, when faced with a proposed or impending disciplinary or adverse action, an affected employee has a choice of possible actions. The employee may remain silent, for example, and accept the action. In that case, the employee may make an initial approach to management in an effort to resolve the matter. If the employee desires representation, the employee may seek the assistance of his or her union representative or the assistance of counsel or some other party. In any event, the choice is that of the employee. An element of the employee's decision as to who will serve as representative may involve a decision as to who will have access to information that may be embarrassing or stigmatizing to the employee. Notwithstanding the Union's assertion here that it would limit access to the "sensitive" information, if the employee chooses not to have the Union act as his representative, the choice may have to be based, at least in part, on a decision not to disclose the information to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not hold that the Union has no interest in information pertaining to disciplinary and adverse actions.&#x2003;Clearly, it does. In fact, the Union has a significant interest in the information as it may be used to determine whether to pursue grievances on behalf of unit employees, to assist in the representation of employees, to administer the...agreements, to ensure that management is complying with various laws, rules, and regulations, and to use as a basis for future negotiations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that our conclusion here does not foreclose the Union from requesting specific information, including information that is unsanitized, under section 7114(b)(4)....&#8197;The Authority would then balance the competing interests in determining whether disclosure of the information is consistent with law....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note the General Counsel's and the Union's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, [32 FLRA 62]. The two relevant provisions in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span> provided that copies of disciplinary and adverse action decision letters would be sent to the union. The Authority determined that release of the decision letters was authorized without regard to whether the information was relevant and necessary under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute or whether the union represented the affected employee. 32 FLRA at 69. The Authority further found that release of the information did not conflict with the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have stated, a balancing test assessing employees' privacy interests and the public's interest in disclosure must be utilized in order to determine whether the disclosure of information is authorized by law. Such a balancing test takes into account the facts and circumstances unique to each case. Here, in the context of a proposal requiring blanket disclosure of all proposed and final disciplinary and adverse actions, we <span id="Page_379"></span>have found that the balance tilts in favor of protecting employees' privacy interests. In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, involving proposals different from the one here, the balance was found to tilt in favor of disclosure....&#8197;As each case must be decided on its own facts, we do not here overrule <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>. However, to the extent that <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span> suggests that, in every case, the union's interest in disclosure of information relating to disciplinary and adverse actions will outweigh the affected employees' privacy interests in the information, we will not adhere to it.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1177 (1992), concerning Proposal 11. Nonnegotiable, for violation of privacy interests, was a proposal that "[t]he employer shall at or about the time it issues a proposed disciplinary or adverse action letter inform the union that a proposal has been issued and the name of the employee." <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 738-41 (1992), determined to be nonnegotiable provisions that the union receive copies of disciplinary documents regardless of whether the union was the designated representative. The FLRA decision did not prevent the union from requesting specific information, including information that is unsanitized and that concerns employees who have not designated the union as their representative. Then, FLRA observed, it would "determine whether disclosure of the information [was] consistent with law," citing <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 37 FLRA 1346, 1364-65 (1990). In a decision predating <span class="Italic">FAA TRACON</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, an employer was directed to supply specific information on specific employees' disciplinary cases so that the union could police a contract, even though the employees who were the objects of the information requests had not designated the union as their representative<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345</span>, 25 FLRA 1060, 1061 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA recapitulated its views on contract requirements concerning disclosure of disciplinary information to unions in <span class="Italic">FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 1410, 1422-25 (1991) (Proposal 3), seeking management's agreement to release of disciplinary and adverse action notices and supporting documentation at various stages of proceedings against employees. FLRA determined, as it relied on Privacy Act implications of individualized and blanket releases of information to support nondisclosure as to employees who have not designated the union as their representative:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that Provision 3, with the exception of section 5.a and b, obligates the Agency to provide certain information to the Union in its role as the designated representative of a bargaining unit employee against whom disciplinary or adverse action is proposed. We find that the Union's assertion is consistent with the plain wording of Provision 3....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1987,...codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301, prohibits disclosure of an employee's drug test results, except in certain circumstances not applicable here, "without the prior written consent of such employee[.]" Further, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7361(b) provides that 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 290ee-3 is applicable to the confidentiality of records maintained as part of drug abuse prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs for Federal employees. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 290ee-3(a) authorizes the release of records, except in circumstances not relevant here, only "in accordance with the prior written consent of the patient with respect to whom such record is maintained[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2 of part A of Provision 3 requires the release to the designated Union representative "of the information being relied upon" in proposing a disciplinary action. As a disciplinary action may be proposed on the basis of drug abuse, "the information being relied upon" in such a situation could include the results of a drug test. Section 2 does not, as plainly worded or interpreted by the Union, encompass the statutory requirement that drug test results may be released only with prior written consent of the employees tested. Accordingly, we find that section 2 would obligate the Agency to release test results without the requisite consent. Consequently, to the extent that section 2 of part A of Provision 3 would require release of drug test results without prior written consent, it is inconsistent with Federal law and nonnegotiable..., even when the Union is an employee's designated representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's position that Provision 3 is nonnegotiable because it does not meet the requirements of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute cannot be sustained. Section 7114(b)(4) establishes a statutory "floor," not a "ceiling," on the type of information an agency may agree to release to a union....&#8197;Concerning the information an agency may agree to release, the Authority stated that "'nothing in section 7114(b)(4) prevents a union from negotiating with an agency for the disclosure of information concerning the conditions of employment of unit employees beyond what it is entitled to under the Statute,' provided that the disclosure is otherwise not legally barred."...&#8197;As proposed disciplinary and adverse actions are matters concerning conditions of employment of unit employees, the Union is authorized to negotiate for release of such documents under section 7114(b)(4), provided, of course, that the release is not otherwise precluded by law....&#8197;In this case, we find that the release of information concerning disciplinary and adverse actions proposed against employees represented by the Union is not barred by law, except to the extent that release of drug test results must legally be conditioned upon prior written consent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's position, the Privacy Act does not preclude release of the information sought by the Union as an employee's representative. The Privacy Act generally prevents disclosure of personal information about Government employees without their written consent. In accordance with section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2), information must be released if so required by the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552. Exemption (b)(6) of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6), requires withholding of information in "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." Under circumstances where the employee who is the subject of the records has designated the Union as his or her representative, we find that the Union's access to the relevant records would not be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Accordingly, Provision 3's requirement that the Union, as an employee's designated representative, be provided with documents concerning a proposed disciplinary or adverse action does not conflict with the Privacy Act. Provision 3, therefore, is negotiable to the extent it concerns the Union as the designated representative of a unit employee, but not to the extent that section 2 of part A would compel release of drug test results without the affected employee's prior written consent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now examine section 5.a and b of the provision's Part A, which, based on the Union's arguments and explanation, pertains to circumstances where employees have not designated the Union as their representative....&#8197;It is well established that a union is entitled to information concerning disciplinary and adverse actions even where it is not designated as the personal representative of the employees involved. Such information is necessary for the exclusive representative to exercise its representation functions and, therefore, is disclosable under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question here is whether the Agency is precluded by law from furnishing unsanitized information which would include personal data identifying employees who do not seek Union representation.&#x2003;Stated differently, the question is whether blanket release of information identifying such employees is barred by section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute because disclosure is prohibited by law, specifically the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the Privacy Act generally prohibits disclosure of personal information about Federal employees, absent the employees' written consent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). In addition, information must be withheld, under exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA, if it is contained in "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether requested information is barred from disclosure by FOIA exemption (b)(9), an individual's right to privacy must be balanced against the public interest in having the information disclosed. The same balancing test must be applied in cases involving the review of negotiated provisions as is applied in resolving disputes resulting from a request for data under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute....&#8197;Moreover, the public interest to be examined, when applying the balancing test required by exemption (b)(6), is that embodied in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the balancing test here, we find that employees' privacy interests in proposed and final disciplinary and adverse actions and the public's interest in disclosure of the information to the Union are significant. On balance, however, we find that the public interest in blanket, unsanitized disclosure of all proposed and final disciplinary and adverse actions to the Union, without an expressed, particularized need for the information, is insufficient to outweigh the employees' strong privacy interests....&#8197;Accordingly, we conclude that the disclosure required by Provision 3 would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the affected employees' personal privacy...prohibited by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We emphasize that, under our decision, the Union is not foreclosed from requesting specific information, including information that is unsanitized and that concerns employees who have not designated the Union as their representative, under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In the event that such a request were disputed, the Authority would then balance the competing interests in determining whether disclosure of the information is consistent with law....</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis is straightforward, and favors the union, when the information request concerns an employee represented by the union in a particular proceeding. Under <span class="Italic">DOJ, Office of Justice Programs and AFSCME Local 2830</span>, 45 FLRA 1022, 1026 (1992), when "the Union, acting as the former employee's representative involving a matter that happened while the individual was a unit employee, had requested only information that concerned the employee personally":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the Privacy Act does not preclude release of information concerning an employee when the information is sought by <span id="Page_380"></span>a union as the employee's representative. <span class="Italic">Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California,</span> 38 FLRA 1410, 1423 (1991). In such circumstances, the union's access to the relevant records would not be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As there is no dispute in this case that the Union was acting as the former employee's representative involving a matter that happened while the individual was a unit employee, we find that the Privacy Act waiver was not necessary for the release of the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the Respondent's delay of close to five months was unreasonable in the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Labor, Wash., DC and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE</span>, 39 FLRA 531, 536-43 (1991), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 51 FLRA 462 (1995) (following a 1991 court remand) [1995 decision discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-11-063.html#sec3-64">Geographical or Organizational Limitations on Right to Information Concerning Comparable Discipline</a>"].</p>
<p class="noindent">Yet in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FDC Houston and AFGE Local 1030</span>, 60 FLRA 91, 94-95 (2004), the agency was required to turn over files of investigations that supported discipline against unit members:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that disclosure of the investigatory files is barred by the Privacy Act.&#x2003;The Privacy Act regulates the disclosure of any information contained in an agency "record" within a "system of records," as those terms are defined in the Privacy Act, that is retrieved by reference to an individual's name or some other personal identifier. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4), (5). With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent. Therefore, if an employee has consented to the release of the requested information, the Privacy Act interposes no bar to that disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the correctional officers have not consented to the release of the files to the Union.&#x2003;Moreover, in <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span>, the Authority held that an employee's designation of the union as his or her representative in connection with a particular matter is not sufficient to constitute consent by the employee to disclosure of information pertaining to that employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(b). <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 1150. The holding in <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span> is consistent with court precedent. <span class="Italic">See Abramsky v. United States Consumer Products Safety Comm.</span>, 478 F. Supp. 1040 (D.C. S.D. N.Y. 1979). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2047, AFGE v. Defense General Supply Center</span>, 423 F. Supp. 481 (D.C. E.D. Va. 1976), <span class="Italic">aff'd </span>573 F.2d 184 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even in the absence of the correctional officers' consent, the investigatory file may still be disclosable if disclosure is not otherwise barred by the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Administration Medical Center, Jackson, Miss.</span>, 32 FLRA 133, 137-38 (1988) (Privacy Act prohibition of disclosure without consent not applicable if disclosure is required under FOIA). More particularly, if disclosure of the requested information would not result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, it is disclosable even in the absence of the consent of the person who is the subject of the information. In this connection, the Respondent claims that disclosure of the information in the investigatory files constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the Privacy Act. An agency asserting that disclosure of particular information constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the Freedom of Information Act so as to be prohibited by the Privacy Act is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information sought is contained in a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 345 (1995) (<span class="Italic">New York TRACON</span>). If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve that public interest. <span class="Italic">See MacDill AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 1151 (citing <span class="Italic">New York TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 345).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the investigatory files constitute "records" within a "system of records" under the Privacy Act. The question then becomes whether disclosure of the investigatory files is otherwise barred by the Privacy Act so as to be "prohibited by law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. More particularly, it is necessary to examine, under the Authority's framework for analyzing Privacy Act claims, whether the Respondent has demonstrated that disclosure of the investigatory files would implicate employee privacy interests and the nature and significance of those interests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on <span class="Italic">FEMTC</span>, the Judge ruled that disclosure of the investigatory files to the Union, as the designated representative of the employees, would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the employees' personal privacy. In <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span>, however, the Authority held that the status of the union as an employee's representative does not lessen the employees' privacy interests in personal information. The Authority expressly stated in <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span> that it would no longer follow <span class="Italic">FEMTC</span> to the extent that it rests on unions having a special status because of their relationship to the individuals about whom such information is sought. <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 1153. Consequently, the Judge erred in finding that, given the Union's status as the correctional officers' designated representative, the disclosure of the investigatory files did not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question then becomes, applying the framework established in <span class="Italic">New York TRACON</span>, whether the Respondent has met its burden of demonstrating that the correctional officers' privacy interests would be affected by the disclosure of the investigatory files. We note initially that, in denying the Union's request for those files, the Respondent made no reference to any employee privacy interests that would be implicated, despite the Union's articulation in its request of the public interest that would be served by disclosure of the information. Moreover, in presenting its case to the Judge, the Respondent asserted no privacy interests on the part of any employees in arguing that the investigatory files were not disclosable, even though it noted that the Union's request did not specify that the files be sanitized. The Respondent also consistently noted to the Judge the "sensitivity" of the information contained in the files, but made no attempt to articulate the nature of that "sensitivity." Only in its brief to the Judge did the Respondent raise concerns about the correctional officers' privacy interests in their disciplinary records. As noted above, the Authority has refused to consider legal arguments raised for the first time in a brief to a judge. <span class="Italic">See PBGC, </span>59 FLRA at 52.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, at the time that the Respondent refused to disclose the investigatory file, it advised that the disciplinary files are available to the employees or their representative at any stage of the disciplinary process. The Respondent does not claim that the disclosure of the investigatory file would reveal the employees' private matters that are not already available to the Union through this disclosure. In this regard, an <span class="Italic">in camera</span> examination of the investigatory file and the disciplinary files, which were made a part of the record for inspection by the Judge and Authority, indicates that the investigatory file does not contain information concerning the private matters of the employees other than those private matters in the disciplinary files. <span class="Italic">See generally United States Dep't of Commerce, Bureau of the Census</span>, 24 FLRA 630, 632 (1986) (reviewing documents provided to a judge and the Authority <span class="Italic">in camera</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review dismissed sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hanlon v. United States FLRA</span>, 859 F.2d 971 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Respondent has failed to sustain its burden under <span class="Italic">New York TRACON</span> to establish that disclosure of the investigatory file would implicate the correctional officers' privacy interests. As such, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">MacDill AFB</span>, where the Authority agreed with the Respondent that there were substantial privacy interests in the disputed data. <span class="Italic">See MacDill AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 1152. Consequently, while the Judge's decision misconstrues the law with respect to the effect of an employee's designation of a union as a representative on an employee's privacy interests under the Privacy Act, we deny the Respondent's exception and sustain the Judge's order requiring the Respondent to provide those files to the Union.</p>
