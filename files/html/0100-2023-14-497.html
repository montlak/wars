<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-498"><span class="space">B.</span> PARKING AND VEHICLES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals regarding distribution of parking spaces to employees in the unit are generally negotiable if they are consistent with law, rule, and regulation. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 53 FLRA 1334, 1338-39 (1998) (Proposal 1), expresses FLRA's more recent analysis of parking space proposals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly determines the conditions of employment of non-unit employees, including supervisors, is outside the duty to bargain.[5] <span class="Italic">American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 32 and U.S. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 505-13 (1995) <span class="Italic">(OPM), aff'd sub nom. American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997). However, the fact that a proposal affects non-unit employees is not sufficient to remove it from the duty to bargain. In this regard, "[n]early every bargaining proposal, if accepted, will have some effect on non-unit personnel<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 815. That a proposal has an indirect effect on non-unit employees may relate to its reasonableness or merits, but does not render the proposal outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> and <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441 n.8. Accordingly, proposals that directly implicate the working conditions of unit employees, and that are otherwise within the duty to bargain, are not removed from the duty simply because they also affect non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;However, "an agency is fully empowered to bargain over, and to choose to agree to, a contract proposal that directly implicates the working conditions of its supervisors" because such proposals address permissive subjects of bargaining<span class="Italic">. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3302 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>, 52 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1996) <span class="Italic">(AFGE, Local 3302)</span>. Accordingly, "[o]nce an agency and a union agree to such a proposal, it is enforceable provided that it is otherwise consistent with the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 682.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The precise line between proposals that have an indirect effect on non-unit employees, and proposals that have a direct effect may be difficult to discern, but nothing on the face of this proposal indicates a direct effect on non-unit employees. The Union's proposal would require the Agency only to provide a proportionate number of parking spaces to unit members. It would not directly determine the allocation of parking spaces to non-unit employees. Although allocation of spaces to employees in the Union's unit obviously would reduce the number of spaces available to others, that effect is not sufficient to remove the proposal from the Agency's duty to bargain. In this regard, the court held, in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, that a proposal that determined parking for all employees, not just bargaining unit members, was outside the duty to bargain because it directly determined conditions of employment of non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441-42. However, the court also stated that a proposal requiring the agency to allocate all parking-spaces to unit employees would be within the duty to bargain. The court stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such a proposal arguably would be unreasonable, for, if accepted, it would leave no parking space for persons outside of the unit. But 'reasonableness' does not determine whether a subject is bargainable. The employer's recourse in response to such a proposal is to reject it or to counter with a more reasonable proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1441 n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, as the Union's proposal does not directly determine conditions of employment of nonunit employees, it is within the duty to bargain unless it is removed from that duty for some reason other than the effect of the proposal on such employees. The Agency's sole other basis for asserting that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain is that: "[bargaining history at the Agency is consistent with the idea that parking policy is outside the duty to bargain." However, such bargaining history is not relevant to determining whether the proposal is within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">American Federation</span> <span class="Italic">of Government Employees, Local 32, AFL-CIO and Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 22 FLRA 478, 483 (1986), <span class="Italic">vacated as to</span> <span class="Italic">other matters sub nom.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2139 and Dept. of Labor</span>, Wage &#x0026; Hour Div., 61 FLRA 654, 656 (2006), adjudicated as negotiable a proposal requiring the agency to continue a GSA lease for parking for unit employees who use their privately owned vehicles a majority of the time on government business:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, "matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law[.]" <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Ass'n,</span> 53 FLRA 625, 648 (1997). In this regard, the Authority has held that an agency is required to bargain over the substance of changes in employee parking, as well as their impact and implementation. <span class="Italic">DOL, </span>44 FLRA at 994-95. Specifically, the Authority recently found that where an agency has leased parking spaces through the GSA, proposals requiring management to subsidize employee parking costs are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 12, </span>61 FLRA 209, 215 (2002)<span class="Italic">; see also United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region</span>, <span class="Italic">Renton, Wash.,</span> 55 FLRA 293, 299 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is undisputed that the Agency has leased parking spaces from GSA for employees for many years. Although the Agency claims that leasing additional spaces would be inconsistent with its regulations governing special lease agreements, "[u]nder section 7117(b) of the Statute, an agency regulation does not bar negotiation on an otherwise negotiable provision unless the agency can demonstrate a compelling need for the regulation under section 2424.11 of the Authority's Regulations." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1005, 1009 (1999) (Member Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds). The Agency has not asserted here that a compelling need exists for its regulations and we therefore need not address them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although the Agency argues correctly that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5704 requires that employees who park in commercial lots be reimbursed on a <span class="Italic">pro rata </span>basis, the proposal concerns parking provided by the employer, rather than reimbursement of employee-rented public parking. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 12,</span> 61 FLRA at 215 (distinguishing proposals concerning agency-leased space and commercially controlled space).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the proposal is not inconsistent with law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's other arguments, the Agency notes that it has released parking spaces at a variety of locations and claims that there would be a negative effect on morale of other unit employees if it continued to pay for parking at the El Paso location. Even if true, however, this claim goes to the merits--not the negotiability--of the proposal. The Agency also claims in its reply that the change in parking here is <span class="Italic">de minimis. </span>The claim that a change in employees' conditions of employment is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> is a bargaining obligation dispute, rather than a negotiability dispute. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.2(a)(2). In its SOP, the Agency specifically stated that it did not assert any bargaining obligation disputes with respect to the proposal, and the Union made no arguments regarding that issue in its response. Thus, insofar as the Agency's <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>argument raises a new bargaining obligation dispute, such argument is not responsive to the Union's arguments raised for the first time in its response and is not permitted under the Authority's regulations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.26(a) (purpose of reply is to respond to arguments made in Union's response).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals limiting allocation of reserved parking space for management officials were nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-89 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bliss</span>, 61 FLRA 777, 778 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 1 and 3 would end the Agency's practice of reserving parking <span id="page_975"></span>spaces for certain specified management officials. As noted above, the Union does not provide any arguments that the proposals are negotiable or respond to the Agency's arguments that the proposals are outside the duty to bargain. Under the Authority's Regulations, a union has the "burden of raising and supporting arguments that the proposal...is within the duty to bargain" and a [f]ailure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(a) and (c). <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 219, 220 (2004). Because the Union failed to respond to the Agency's argument, consistent with the Authority's Regulations, if appropriate, the Union's lack of response constitutes a concession that the proposals are outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority and judicial precedent, proposals that directly determine the conditions of employment of management officials are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., PASS, District No. 6, PASS/NMEBA</span>, 54 FLRA 1130, 1135-36 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>, 51 FLRA 491 (1995), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span>, 110 F.3d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1997)). It is undisputed that: (1) the parking spaces referenced in the proposals are reserved for management officials; and (2) the reservation of parking spaces for management officials is a matter that concerns their conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2879, AFL-CIO</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1088 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 2879</span>) (proposal reserving parking spaces for management officials and other nonunit personnel seeks to regulate the conditions of employment of those personnel). Because Proposals 1 and 3 would directly determine the availability of parking for the management officials referenced in the proposals, they are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFSCME, Local 2910</span>, 53 FLRA 1334, 1338-39 (1998) (proposal requiring agency to reserve parking spaces only for unit employees does not directly determine the allocation of parking spaces to nonunit personnel and is within the duty to bargain).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under earlier decisions, FLRA determined that proposals involving parking arrangements "vitally affect" unit employees because they enhance unit employee morale and reduce sick and annual leave usage by employees who would not be able to walk long distances during inclement weather. Because the proposals vitally affect unit employees, their effect on nonunit employees was immaterial to their negotiability. <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2297 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point</span>, 38 FLRA 1451, 1460-61 (1991) (Proposal 2, noting that proposals may not contravene GSA government-wide regulations at 41 CFR 101-20.104 setting priorities for allocation of space), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1439-42 (D.C.

Circuit).</p>
<p class="noindent">The impact of the "vitally affects" test was explored in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, San Diego</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1085 (1994), determining negotiability of two proposals concerning parking:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Provision 4</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;The OHA [Office of Hearings and Appeals] shall reserve parking spaces for the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Hearing Office Manager, and the Supervisory Staff Attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Provision 5</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The remaining parking spaces shall be allocated to all other employees in the Office of Hearing[s and] Appeals, with preference given to vanpool/carpool vehicles.</p>
<p class="noindent">Neither proposal was negotiable, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879</span>, 49 FLRA at 1086-90:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the court examined the Authority's adoption of the vitally affects test used in the private sector to determine whether proposals directly relating to the conditions of employment of persons outside a bargaining unit might nevertheless fall within the scope of the duty to bargain. In the court's view, the vitally affects test is appropriately used "to define the limited circumstances in which subjects not normally seen to be within the compass of mandatory bargaining--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the terms of a relationship between the employer and a third party--may become mandatory subjects due to their effect on bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1440. The court added that the test "is <span class="Italic">not</span> implicated, however, merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (emphasis in original). The court recognized that most union bargaining demands would have some "extra-unit effects" on non-unit personnel but held that such effects would not alter an employer's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.6. The court found that "proposals that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit personnel are within the traditional scope of mandatory bargaining<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1441. The vitally affects test is not relevant to such proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the applicability of the vitally affects test, the court differentiated among four groups of nonunit personnel: employees not in any bargaining unit, non-employees, management personnel, and employees in other bargaining units. The court held that the vitally affects test does not apply in circumstances where a union seeks to regulate through collective bargaining the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and of management personnel who are excluded by the Statute from bargaining units. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1441. With respect to employees not in any bargaining unit and non-employees, the court held that the vitally affects test applies when the interests of such individuals are "directly implicated" by a union proposal or when a proposal "purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment" of such non-bargaining unit employees or non-employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In these circumstances, the proposal would fall outside the mandatory scope of bargaining absent a showing that the proposal vitally affects conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923 and</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, Health Care</span> <span class="Italic">Financing Admin., Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1416-17 (1992) (<span class="Italic">HCFA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the court held that the vitally affects test does not apply in circumstances where a union seeks to regulate through collective bargaining the conditions of employment of management or supervisory personnel who are excluded by the Statute from bargaining units. The court noted that pursuant to section 7112 of the Statute, managers and supervisors "are legally disabled from belonging to any bargaining unit[.]" <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1442. Therefore, the court found that permitting a union to seek to negotiate to regulate the conditions of employment of supervisors or other management personnel would "violate the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the certified or recognized unit, and those employees <span class="Italic">only." Id</span>. (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4 requires the Agency to reserve parking spaces for the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the Hearing Office Manager, and the Supervisory Staff Attorney. By its terms, Provision 4 seeks to regulate the conditions of employment of management and supervisory personnel who are excluded by the Statute from bargaining units. Accordingly, based on the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, we conclude that Provision 4 does not concern the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees and is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See Dept. of Defense, Defense Contract Audit Agency, Central</span> <span class="Italic">Region and AFGE, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3529</span>, 47 FLRA 512 (1993) (Provision 4) (pursuant to <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, a provision that purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of supervisory or management personnel is nonnegotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 3 requires that all hearing office employees who qualify for a California handicapped license plate or parking placard be given a parking space.&#x2003;Provision 5 requires that the remaining parking spaces be allocated to all other employees in the Agency's San Diego office, with preference given to vanpool and/or carpool vehicles. By requiring the Agency to provide parking to "all" employees in the office who meet the criteria of the provisions, Provisions 3 and 5 purport to regulate the conditions of employment of those employees. The record indicates, however, that some employees in the Agency's San Diego office are in another unit represented by the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provisions 3 and 5, as written, are not consistent with a construction that limits their terms to employees who are in the bargaining unit represented by the Union and non-supervisory employees who are not in any bargaining unit<span class="Italic">. See Naval Aviation Depot</span>, 45 FLRA at 1162. Rather, the provisions encompass employees represented by the Union as well as employees in another bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We stated above that in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span> the court noted the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the recognized unit, and those employees only. Consistent with this principle, the court held, as relevant here, that a union may not seek to "regulate the conditions of employment of...employees in other bargaining units." 952 F.2d at 1443. According to the court, "[s]uch bargaining proposals are impermissible" under the Statute<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. As Provisions 3 and 5 seek to regulate the conditions of employment of employees in another bargaining unit, we conclude, based on the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, that Provisions 3 and 5 are nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IFPTE and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Security Force Battalion, Pacific</span>, 47 FLRA 1086 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps Security Force Battalion</span>) (proposal was found nonnegotiable because it attempted to regulate the conditions of employment of employees in bargaining units other than those represented by the union).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Union's assertion that the applicable Government-wide parking regulations, 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101-20.104 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, require parking proposals to address all unit and non-unit employees in the Agency and that the parking provisions formulated by the Arbitrator merely reflect these requirements. However, the Union has not shown that the regulations necessarily preclude a proposal that is limited in scope to prescribing parking policies for employees in the Union's bargaining unit and non-supervisory personnel who are not represented in any unit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_976"></span>In summary, we conclude that based on the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, Provisions 3, 4, and 5 are nonnegotiable. Because the provisions are not limited to employees in the Union's bargaining unit and non-unit, non-supervisory personnel, we do not address "whether the 'vitally affects' test is satisfied with respect to those persons...." 952 F.2d at 1443. Having found that the provisions are nonnegotiable based on <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, we do not address the Agency's arguments that the provisions are inconsistent with Government-wide regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Cherry Point,</span> FLRA considered parking space proposals as to their effect on nonunit employees. In <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1943 and Naval Air Rework Facility, Naval Air Station, Jacksonville</span>, 29 FLRA 250, 252-53 (1987), proposals established priorities among van pools and carpools in the allocation of parking space and required the agency to issue color-coded parking decals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Federal Property Management Regulations (FPMRs), parking spaces not required for official needs may be used for employee parking.... The regulations state that space available for employee parking is to be allocated on an equitable basis.... The regulations establish priorities for the allocation and assignment of employee parking spaces. In particular, the regulations establish a priority for vanpools and carpools as a group, after spaces have been assigned to severely handicapped employees, executive personnel and persons who work unusual hours.... The Union's proposals further define the priorities for vanpools and carpools within that group....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not contend that these proposals violate the FPMRs.&#x2003;The only issue is whether these proposals are outside the duty to bargain because they concern conditions of employment of nonunit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, these proposals would have only a limited and indirect effect on the conditions of employment of nonunit employees. The FPMRs require the Agency to assign parking to all employees in accordance with specific priorities. Thus, the Agency is able to provide parking spaces for nonunit employees only if those employees fall within the priority categories. Moreover, the regulations require that parking spaces be assigned equitably. These proposals do not grant or deny parking spaces to nonunit employees; they merely establish the general conditions under which parking spaces will be assigned to employees who apply and how those employees who are assigned spaces under the proposed priorities are to be identified. Therefore, these proposals do not directly determine nonunit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It is not uncommon for collective bargaining proposals to have an effect on nonunit employees. However, not every effect is sufficient to remove a proposal from the duty to bargain.... [T]hat indirect effect in our view is not sufficient to preclude bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, even assuming that Proposal 1 directly determines the conditions of employment of nonunit employees, we would find that the assignment of parking spaces does not concern a vital interest of those employees and therefore is within the duty to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the agency provide suitable parking for government and private automobiles. The proposal did not directly conflict with GSA or agency regulations and it did not encroach the right of management to determine the agency budget. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 383 (1987) (Proposal 8). A change in parking space allotment required substantive bargaining over the decision. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 29 FLRA 307, 308 (1987) (ALJ Decision). That the parking spaces were in the control of GSA did not relieve the agency of its obligation, consistent with GSA regulations, to request GSA to delegate to the agency the authority to allocate parking space or to request GSA to allocate a designated number of spaces for employee parking. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, OSHA</span>, 21 FLRA 658, 663-64 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS Houston Dist. and NTEU Chap. 222</span>, 25 FLRA 843 (1987) (concerning both free and rental costs for spaces); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782 and Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census</span>, 48 FLRA 1224 (1993) (proposal for parking spaces for union officials was not contrary to Federal Property Management Regulations); <span class="Italic">Coordinating Comm. of Unions and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 29 FLRA 1436 (1987) (Proposal 2, requiring parking spaces for union officials). Negotiations over proposals concerning fee increases for parking were not barred by Comptroller General decisions precluding reimbursement of employee commuting expenses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 44 FLRA 988 (1992) (reviewing decisions).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 6 and IRS, New Orleans Dist.</span>, 3 FLRA 748 (1980), considered the broad question of what constitutes a government-wide regulation. [The decision is discussed in Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-031.html#sec5-32">Government-Wide Regulations</a>."] In the process, FLRA determined that a union could require negotiations over aspects of a parking space program administered in part by GSA through government-wide regulations and in part by an agency that had control over the space. FLRA rejected the IRS contention that the proposal was nonnegotiable because it was within the discretion of the agency to determine the methods and means of performing work. Providing parking spaces for commuting employees was not a matter concerning the performance of work by the agency. Also rejected was the agency argument that the proposal conflicted with the right of the agency to determine its budget. The agency argued that because employees would be required by GSA regulations to pay only one-half of the value of the parking spaces, the agency to pay the remainder, the retention of the parking spaces imposed additional costs on the agency. Citing <span class="Italic">AFGE and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 604 (1980), FLRA reiterated that there is no violation of the right of an agency to determine its budget because a proposal imposes additional costs on an agency. The union proposal did not prescribe that the agency budget include a specific provision for funding the parking spaces. The agency did not demonstrate that retention of spaces resulted in a significant increase in costs. The figures indicated that the added costs amounted to less than 1/6 of 1% of the total budget of the regional office involved in the dispute. But FLRA decided that the agency and union could not avoid an obligation imposed by GSA regulations that employees pay for parking spaces provided to them by their employing agencies. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 200-B and VAMC, Syracuse</span>, 44 FLRA 821, 828-29 (1992) (Proposals 1, 2, and 4), generally required negotiation of proposals concerning the cost of parking for employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, statutorily charged by 38 USC 8109 with assessment of parking fees used to defray operation and construction costs through a revolving fund arrangement. FLRA was disinclined to accept projections from the agency showing that decreased charges negotiated by the union would undercut the viability of the revolving fund. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VA, VAMC, Decatur and AFGE Local 2778</span>, 46 FLRA 339 (1992) (ULP resulting from failure to negotiate over parking rates).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that reserved parking be allocated on the basis of one criterion instead of the multitude of criteria established by government-wide regulations. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Atlanta Serv. Ctr.</span>, 8 FLRA 37, 39-40 (1982). In another parking space case, the availability of reserved parking space was nonnegotiable: it conflicted with then controlling OMB government-wide directives concerning allocation of parking spaces among groups of employees, e.g., those with disabilities. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2151 and GSA, Nat'l Capital Region</span>, 7 FLRA 535 (1981). FLRA also decided that management's right to determine means of performing work precluded negotiation over a decision by management as to how it will use its parking facilities to accommodate agency clientele. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3399 and Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hosp., Columbia</span>, 9 FLRA 1022, 1023 (1982). A proposal that adequate parking shall be provided for both government and private autos was nonnegotiable. Matters relating to the use of government vehicles, including parking, constitute methods, means, and technology of performing the agency work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 21 FLRA 1046, 1048-49 (1986) (Proposal 2).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 58 FLRA 432, 435 (2003) (on review, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468 (D.C. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">post</span>, following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004) (imposing <span class="Italic">status quo </span>bargaining remedy)), there was no ULP when management declined to bargain over the substance of a decision to change parking arrangements by permitting VA patients to park in what had been an employee parking area. FLRA determined that the agency's determination of how its parking facilities will be used to accommodate its patient clientele involves the means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). That result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468, 478-79 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disposing of the second complaint, the Authority determined that the Medical Center's unilateral decision to allow patients to park in the "employee lot" was a decision with respect to a "means of performing work" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and therefore was exempt from mandatory bargaining. The Union objects that the FLRA has long held that parking is a fully negotiable condition of employment and that the decision at issue falls within the Medical Center's mandatory duty to bargain. On the record at hand, we uphold the Authority's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that provision of <span class="Italic">employee</span> parking is a condition of employment that is fully negotiable under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. 988, 994, 1992 WL 93040 (1992) ("<span class="Italic">Dep't of Labor</span>"). However, it is also clear that an agency's decision regarding which of its facilities it will use to provide <span class="Italic">patient</span> parking is a determination relating to a "means of performing work" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), regardless of whether the decision incidentally affects employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3399,</span> 9 F.L.R.A. at 1023. We find no merit in the Union's contention that <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3399</span> is distinguishable because the parties' collective bargaining agreement in this case makes parking subject to local negotiations. Moreover, the FLRA decisions relied upon by the Union do not support the proposition that all agency decisions involving parking are subject to mandatory bargaining. These decisions all involve agency actions that directly regulate the provision of employee parking, and none involves an assertion of the agency's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Labor,</span> 44 F.L.R.A. at 994; <span class="Italic">United States Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv.,</span> 43 F.L.R.A. 3, 9-10, 1991 WL 237787 (1991); <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Base,</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Station &#x0026; Philadelphia Naval Shipyard,</span> 37 F.L.R.A. 79, 87, 1990 WL 140083 (1990); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Williams Air Force Base, Chandler, Az.,</span> 38 F.L.R.A. 549, 562 1990 WL 201601 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency decision may fall within &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) 's "means of performing work" exemption where the subject of the decision has a "direct and integral relationship" to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2441,</span> 864 F.2d at 181; <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Indian Health Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 885 <span id="page_977"></span>F.2d 911, 913-14 (D.C. Cir. 1989). In this case, the Authority reasonably determined that the provision of patient parking is directly and integrally related to the Department of Veterans Affairs' mission to provide health services to veterans. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 301(b) (2000) (stating that the Department's purpose is "to administer the laws providing benefits and other services to veterans and the dependents and the beneficiaries of veterans"). The Authority likewise reasonably determined that the Medical Center's decision to allow patients to park in a lot in which employees also park was a determination with respect to the provision of patient, rather than employee, parking. The Medical Center's actions did not directly regulate employee parking, and any effect on bargaining unit employees was incidental. Accordingly, we uphold the Authority's determination that the Medical Center's decision to allow patients to park in the same lot with employees was exempt from mandatory bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent">With the limitations just noted, proposals regarding distribution of parking spaces to unit employees are negotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3525 and DOJ, Bd. of Immigration Appeals</span>, 10 FLRA 61, 66 (1982). An agency is required to bargain concerning the decision to relinquish unneeded or underutilized parking spaces to GSA. <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. and AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals</span>, 12 FLRA 650 (1983). A decision made solely by the agency to reduce parking spaces by eliminating an arrangement that permitted use of some vacant property was bargainable as to substance and impact. A <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy was warranted after the agency unilaterally rescinded the parking arrangement in effect for a period of years. <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 16 FLRA 1007, 1008 (1984) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Williams AFB and AFGE Local 1776</span>, 38 FLRA 549 (1990) (ALJ Decision) (agency improperly unilaterally eliminated parking spaces or changed local policy on reserved parking without first notifying union and allowing it opportunity to bargain substance and impact of changes).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that penalties imposed by a carpooling committee involving suspension of parking privileges first be discussed with the union. It did not prevent the agency from acting at all with respect to discipline of employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Atlanta Serv. Ctr.</span>, 8 FLRA 37, 38, 40 (1982) (Proposal 5).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal to provide employees keys to enter their offices from a parking lot, circumventing a security checkpoint, was nonnegotiable. The purpose of the agency in locking the facility was to safeguard the building to avoid theft. The proposal infringed the agency's right to determine its internal security practices by implementing plans to secure physical property against internal or external risks. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 15 FLRA 612 (1984).</p>
