<p class="noindent">Proposals were not negotiable that interfered with the right of the agency to determine technology of work that, although pertaining to safety enhancements, required the agency to equip its facilities with various communications equipment having particular capabilities. <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 13 FLRA 508, 508-09 (1983). Proposals were negotiable that defined certain safety- and comfort-related <span id="page_912"></span>criteria as to VDT machines, e.g., availability of adjustable chairs and tables, types of working surfaces and paneling around workstations, provision of radiation protection shields, allowable level of radiation emitted by the machines, and amount of noise generated by printers. The proposals related to matters affecting working conditions but did not interfere with the use of VDT technology or the purpose it served. To sustain a claim that a proposal concerning employment conditions is negotiable only at the agency's election because it directly interferes with management's right to determine technology, the agency must establish the technological relation of the proposal to accomplishment or furtherance of performance of agency work and the agency must establish what interference the proposal would cause with the purpose of the technology. Without that showing, the proposal is incidental to the performance of the agency's work and principally related to working conditions. Earlier FLRA rulings were distinguished, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of Social Security Field Office Locals and DHHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA 842, 847-48 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Mine Health and Safety Administration</span>, [15 FLRA 902 (1984)], and in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, [13 FLRA 422 (1983)], the proposals which the Authority found interfered with management's right to determine the technology of performing work each expressly required the agency to provide equipment which was part of the technical method of performing the agency's work--telephones in the former and calculators with memory and percentage functions in the latter. In <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, 7 FLRA 578 (1982), the Authority found a part of Proposal 9 concerning the agency's choices of equipment or facilities to be drafted so broadly as to require negotiations over <span class="Italic">all</span> equipment and facilities, including those involving the technical method used by the agency for performing its work. The Authority specifically stated in that decision, however, that a proposal focusing on particular equipment which did <span class="Italic">not</span> constitute part of the technical method used by an agency for accomplishing its work would be within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Agency has not established that a technological relationship exists between the proposed equipment standards and arrangements and performing the Agency's work. Second, it has not established in any event that such standards and arrangements if agreed upon would interfere in any way with the purpose for which the Agency has adopted VDT technology to perform its work. Accordingly, it follows under <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span> that the Agency has not established that the proposals directly interfere with its right to determine the technology of performing its work.</p>
<p class="noindent">Comptroller General decisions did not preclude the purchase of the equipment compelled by the proposals. Under those decisions personal or special equipment may be purchased if the Comptroller's criteria are met. FLRA cited <span class="Italic">Ohio River Div.</span>, 63 Comp. Gen. 278, 380-81 (1984), <span class="Italic">Sec'y of Interior</span>, 45 Comp. Gen. 215 (1965), and <span class="Italic">Sec'y of War</span>, 3 Comp. Gen. 433 (1924). <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of Social Security Field Office Locals and DHHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA 842, 848-49 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Vicksburg and AFGE Local 3310</span>, 59 FLRA 835, 837-38 (2004) (following remand, 61 FLRA 258 (2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>), a ULP case involving an allegation of improper repudiation of a contract provision, FLRA considered the effect of a Comptroller General decision stating that, under 29 USC 668(a) and 29 CFR 1910.132(a), the agency had discretion to purchase for employees special insulated clothing to permit work during cold weather:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General's decision in Mississippi Insulated Coveralls stated that weather-related protective clothing may be furnished by the government if the agency head determines the clothing to be necessary under OSHA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 668(a), and its implementing regulations and standards. The decision further stated that an agency may use appropriated funds to furnish insulated coveralls so long as the agency determines the coveralls to be necessary under &#x00A7; 668(a). Specifically, the Comptroller General noted that, under &#x00A7; 668(a), the head of each Federal agency must "establish and maintain an effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health program" that is consistent with applicable standards promulgated by the Secretary of Labor.[6] In particular, &#x00A7; 668(a)(2) provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The head of each agency shall (after consultation with representatives of the employees thereof)--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;acquire, maintain, and require the use of safety equipment, personal protective equipment, and devices reasonably necessary to protect employees[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;As relevant here, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1910.132(a) provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Protective equipment, including...protective clothing,...shall be provided, used, and maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition wherever it is necessary by reason of hazards of processes or environment, chemical hazards, radiological hazards, or mechanical irritants encountered in a manner capable of causing injury or impairment in the function of any part of the body through absorption, inhalation or physical contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General found that this standard requires "the employer (here ERDC) to assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, and, as necessary, to make available appropriate protective equipment to affected employees." Mississippi Insulated Coveralls, slip op. at 4 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that &#x00A7; 668(a)(2) authorizes the Respondent to provide protective clothing, specifically insulated coveralls, to unit employees as long as certain circumstances are met. In this respect, the language of &#x00A7; 668(a)(2) that grants the Respondent the authority to "acquire, maintain, and require the use of...personal protective equipment...reasonably necessary to protect employees," clearly indicates that the Respondent has the discretion to determine whether protective clothing or coveralls are necessary, and that if it has made such a determination, appropriated funds may lawfully be used to furnish such coveralls. Furthermore, the language of &#x00A7; 668(a), which requires an agency head to consult with representatives of employees, supports the conclusion that the Respondent can exercise this discretion through collective bargaining with the union. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> Local 1547</span>, 55 FLRA 684, 685-86 (1999) (negotiability of proposal requiring agency to provide reflective motorcycle vests governed in part by compliance with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 668(a)); <span class="Italic">Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 41 FLRA 107, 110-11 (1991) (same); <span class="Italic">Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, Truck Drivers, Warehousemen and Helpers of Jacksonville, Local Union 512</span>, 32 FLRA 1200, 1205-06 (1988) (same). <span class="Italic">See also In the Matter of National Council of Meat Graders, AFGE</span>, 57 Comp. Gen. 379, B-190, 292 (March 28, 1978) (Comptroller General found that nothing in OSHA or implementing regulations precludes negotiations on the determination required by Secretary of Agriculture or his designee to provide protective clothing and that implementing regulations further emphasize that consultation with representatives of employees under &#x00A7; 668(a) shall be done consistent with labor management relations program under the Executive Order 11491).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question that must be resolved in this case is whether the Respondent, in accordance with &#x00A7; 668(a)(2), made a determination that providing insulated coveralls to unit employees was reasonably necessary. The Comptroller General found that the Respondent had not made such a determination under &#x00A7; 668(a)(2). However, this finding was not based on an undisputed factual finding; rather, it was based solely on a statement from the Respondent's "[c]ounsel advis[ing] [the Comptroller General's] Office that the agency has not determined that insulated coveralls are necessary to comply with OSHA or its implementing regulations." <span class="Italic">Mississippi Insulated Coveralls</span>, slip op. at 4. There is no evidence in the record before us that addresses whether the Respondent made such a determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Comptroller General's decision did not address the General Counsel's argument to the Judge that the parties' coveralls agreement <span class="Italic">itself</span> constituted a determination by the Respondent that the insulated coveralls were necessary under &#x00A7; 668(a)(2). Accordingly, the Comptroller General's decision did not establish as a matter of law that the coveralls agreement in this case was unlawful and that the Respondent's repudiation of the agreement did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following remand, FLRA determined that the agency did not repudiate its agreement. <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Vicksburg and AFGE Local 3310</span>, 61 FLRA 258 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals 33 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 65 FLRA 142, 145-47 (2010), required negotiation, as an arrangement, over a proposal defining a "stab-resistant vest" as safety equipment and requiring that the vest be maintained in a secure area to be issued to employees on request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The proposal does not affect management's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute extends to both performance-related and nonperformance-related conduct. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1709, </span>56 FLRA 549, 553 (2000). Proposals that preclude management from taking disciplinary action against employees for a particular offense affect management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1692, </span>40 FLRA 868, 873 (1991); <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates, &#x0026; Pilots, Panama Canal Pilots Branch, </span>32 FLRA 269, 275 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has held that provisions preventing management from disciplining employees for specified conduct are contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, the plain language of the proposal contains no restrictions on management's right to take disciplinary actions against employees. SOP at 11 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345, </span>48 FLRA 168, 202 (1993)). As previously noted, the proposal is intended only to reduce the likelihood that an employee will fail to wear the vest at work, not to restrict management's right to take disciplinary action when such action occurs. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not affect management's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Assuming the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices includes the authority to <span id="page_913"></span>determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Fed. Prison Council 33</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1115 (1996) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, FPC</span>). Furthermore, a federal correctional facility has special security concerns that may not be present at other work locations. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 683</span>, 30 FLRA 497, 500 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661</span>, 29 FLRA 990 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of this decision, we assume without deciding that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, and, for the following reasons, we conclude that it is within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">i.&#x2003;The proposal is an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal or provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the analytical framework articulated in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87, </span>21 FLRA 24, (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this framework, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 33. In this regard, the Authority considers whether the proposal is "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local </span>1687, 52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that proposals "intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements negotiable under [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(3)[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 191 (1994). In particular, such "prophylactic" proposals will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to determine reliably which employees will be adversely affected by an agency action so as to draft a proposal to apply only to those employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>An arrangement need not "target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1163 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union identifies the adverse effects of the Agency's procedure as: (1) placing a great burden on employees to wear or carry the vest to work each day or face discipline such that employees could become discouraged from use and retention of the vest even though use of the vest would protect them from "clear and demonstrable dangers"; (2) creating a potential danger for a corrections officer who may be seen displaying the vest outside the corrections facility; (3) creating the risk of the vests being stolen; (4) creating and unnecessary possibility or likelihood of being disciplined for neglecting to bring the vest to work on a particular day; (5) creating the risk of exposing the employee to heat exhaustion or irritations associated with wearing the vest to and from work on hot and humid days; and (6) burdening the employee in a non-paid status with the cleaning and maintenance of the vest. The instant proposal is prophylactic in that it would eliminate the possibility that any of these adverse effects would occur. Moreover, the proposal is tailored to the extent possible. The proposal only applies to those bargaining unit employee who request a stab-resistant vest--i.e., the very employees who would suffer the adverse effects of the Agency's practice. In this regard, the fact that employees are not required to wear stab-resistant vests does not, as the Agency argues, eliminate the adverse effects on those employees who request such vests; that fact merely precludes adverse effects on those employees who do not request a stab-resistant vest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we conclude that this proposal is sufficiently tailored and that the proposal is an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 171</span>, 64 FLRA 275, 277 (2009) (proposal applying only to those employees who are affected by the management right to determine internal security practice is an arrangement); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1770, </span>64 FLRA 953, 959 (2010) (proposal applying to mitigate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of management's right is an arrangement).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ii.&#x2003;The arrangement is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. In making this determination, the Authority balances the proposal's benefits to employees against its burdens on management. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 171, </span>64 FLRA at 277.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposal would benefit employees by relieving them of the burdens of wearing or carrying the vests to work each day and cleaning and maintaining the vests.&#x2003;According to the Union, the proposal also would benefit employees by reducing: (1) the potential dangers to correctional officers who may be seen wearing the vests outside the facility; (2) the possibility of employees being disciplined for failing to wear the vests; (3) the possibility of the vests being stolen; and (4) employees' exposure to heat exhaustion or other irritations from wearing the vests on hot or humid days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the proposal would affect its internal security because it would have to provide access to the secure area for each officer who requests a vest and for additional individuals to facilitate the collection, storage and distribution of the vests. However, the proposal does not state that employees who receive the vests must be granted access to the secure area where the vests would be stored, or provide any indication as to how many (if any) additional employees would need access to such areas in order to collect, store and distribute the vests. Moreover, the Agency does not provide any basis for finding that the fact that stab-resistant vests are different from bullet-proof vests affects its internal security practice regarding access to storage areas.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that no institution currently has the capability to store the number of vests that may be issued to correctional officers.&#x2003;However, the Agency fails to provide sufficient information to support this assertion. Although the Agency has provided the number of employees at its facilities, it has failed to provide any evidence regarding the number of employees who have requested vests since the implementation of the plan--i.e., the number of employees to whom the proposal would likely apply. The Agency also fails to support its assertion that the proposal would require the Agency to create a changing area in an area that is secure, as opposed to some other area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In weighing the benefits to employees against the burdens placed upon the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the record establishes that the proposal would benefit employees. In contrast, the Agency has failed to support its claims that the proposal would significantly burden the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. As such, we find that the proposal's benefits to employees outweigh its burdens on management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, </span>62 FLRA 321 (benefits of proposal outweigh the burdens placed on management where Agency fails to establish that the proposal constitutes a significant burden on its right to determine internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nothing prevented the union from negotiating a clause that management designate eye hazard areas, equipment, and occupations. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1827 and DMA, Aerospace Ctr.</span>, 26 FLRA 785, 793 (1987) (Proposal 3). Remanded to an arbitrator was an award requiring an agency to abide by a contract provision calling for the employer provide cold-weather clothing to employees. On remand the arbitrator was to resolve whether OSHA regulations required the expenditure or whether the expenditure was justified under 5 USC 7903, providing in part: "[a]ppropriations available for the procurement of supplies and material or equipment are available for the purchase and maintenance of special clothing and equipment for the protection of personnel in the performance of their assigned tasks." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Whiteman AFB and AFGE Local 2361</span>, 68 FLRA 969, 972 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (majority opinion discussing Comptroller General decisions).</p>
