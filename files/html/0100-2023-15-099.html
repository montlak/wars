<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-98"><span class="space">3.</span> Use of Government Office for Private Gain</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board offers no comprehensive definition of the charge of use of a government office for private gain. The Office of Government Ethics provides guidance, 5 CFR 2635.702 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Use of public office for private gain.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for <span id="Page_2593"></span>the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. The specific prohibitions set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply this general standard, but are not intended to be exclusive or to limit the application of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Inducement or coercion of benefits</span>. An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Offering to pursue a relative's consumer complaint over a household appliance, an employee of the Securities and Exchange Commission called the general counsel of the manufacturer and, in the course of discussing the problem, stated that he worked at the SEC and was responsible for reviewing the company's filings. The employee violated the prohibition against use of public office for private gain by invoking his official authority in an attempt to influence action to benefit his relative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee of the Department of Commerce was asked by a friend to determine why his firm's export license had not yet been granted by another office within the Department of Commerce. At a department-level staff meeting, the employee raised as a matter for official inquiry the delay in approval of the particular license and asked that the particular license be expedited. The official used her public office in an attempt to benefit her friend and, in acting as her friend's agent for the purpose of pursuing the export license with the Department of Commerce, may also have violated 18 U.S.C. 205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appearance of governmental sanction</span>. Except as otherwise provided in this part, an employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that could reasonably be construed to imply that his agency or the Government sanctions or endorses his personal activities or those of another. When teaching, speaking, or writing in a personal capacity, he may refer to his official title or position only as permitted by &#x00A7; 2635.807(b). He may sign a letter of recommendation using his official title only in response to a request for an employment recommendation or character reference based upon personal knowledge of the ability or character of an individual with whom he has dealt in the course of Federal employment or whom he is recommending for Federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee of the Department of the Treasury who is asked to provide a letter of recommendation for a former subordinate on his staff may provide the recommendation using official stationery and may sign the letter using his official title. If, however, the request is for the recommendation of a personal friend with whom he has not dealt in the Government, the employee should not use official stationery or sign the letter of recommendation using his official title, unless the recommendation is for Federal employment. In writing the letter of recommendation for his personal friend, it may be appropriate for the employee to refer to his official position in the body of the letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Endorsements</span>. An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office to endorse any product, service or enterprise except:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;In furtherance of statutory authority to promote products, services or enterprises; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;As a result of documentation of compliance with agency requirements or standards or as the result of recognition for achievement given under an agency program of recognition for accomplishment in support of the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A Commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission may not appear in a television commercial in which she endorses an electrical appliance produced by her former employer, stating that it has been found by the CPSC to be safe for residential use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A Foreign Commercial Service officer from the Department of Commerce is asked by a United States telecommunications company to meet with representatives of the Government of Spain, which is in the process of procuring telecommunications services and equipment. The company is bidding against five European companies and the statutory mission of the Department of Commerce includes assisting the export activities of U.S. companies. As part of his official duties, the Foreign Commercial Service officer may meet with Spanish officials and explain the advantages of procurement from the United States company.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 3</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may sign a letter to an oil company indicating that its refining operations are in compliance with Federal air quality standards even though he knows that the company has routinely displayed letters of this type in television commercials portraying it as a "trustee of the environment for future generations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An Assistant Attorney General may not use his official title or refer to his Government position in a book jacket endorsement of a novel about organized crime written by an author whose work he admires. Nor may he do so in a book review published in a newspaper.</p>

To ensure that the performance of his official duties does not give rise to an appearance of use of public office for private gain or of giving preferential treatment, an employee whose duties would affect the financial interests of a friend, relative or person with whom he is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity shall comply with any applicable requirements of &#x00A7; 2635.502.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive branch employees are subject to an important set of ethics rules contained in the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch. These rules serve to guard the federal service against ethical problems that could undermine public confidence in the integrity of the government's operations. They regulate such things as conflicts of interest, misuse of position, impartiality, and gifts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Earlier "Director's Notes" have discussed conflicts of interest, impartiality, and gifts. Today's note focuses on the rule against misuse of position. This rule reflects a view, which has gained currency in the international community, that one definition of corruption is the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. Consistent with that view, the rule against misuse of position prohibits employees from:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Using public office for their own private gain for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom they are affiliated in a non-government capacity;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Endorsing any product, service, or company;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Engaging in financial transactions using nonpublic information, or allowing the improper use of nonpublic information to further private interests; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Misusing government property or official time.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">From the Department of Justice Ethics Office we are informed as to misuse of a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may not use his public office for his own private gain or for that of persons or organizations with which he is associated personally. An employee's position or title should not be used to coerce; to endorse any product, service or enterprise; or to give the appearance of governmental sanction. An employee may use his official title and stationery only in response to a request for a reference or recommendation for someone he has dealt with in Federal employment or someone he is recommending for Federal employment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Question</span>: What is meant by the phrase "use of public office for private gain"?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Answer</span>: You may not use or permit the use of your position or title to induce or coerce someone to grant a benefit to yourself or another (e.g., don't call a subordinate and tell him/her that he/she has an application from your cousin and that you are most interested in the results of your subordinate's review of the application). You may not use or permit the use of your position or title to sanction or endorse the activities of any other person (e.g., don't make a television advertisement in which you identify your position and title as a nutritionist for the Department and promote sales of a particular brand of margarine). Even when teaching, speaking, or writing, you may refer to your official title or position only in the three limited ways permitted by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.807(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to intent to violate ethics regulations, "However, she violated the regulations when she sold the products, regardless of whether she knew of her ethical <span id="Page_2594"></span>responsibilities or intended to violate them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perdue v.

<p class="Body-Text">To sustain the charge of using public office for private gain, as opposed to an attempt charge, gain to the employee must be shown, meaning that if the employee's efforts are foiled, the charge will not be upheld. <span class="Italic">Mann v. DHHS</span>, 78 MSPR 1, 7-8 (1998), said of an employee's attempted use of an agency Federal Express mailer for a personal project:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stipulated that she had control and custody over Federal Express airbills that were preprinted for use by the agency for sending official business correspondence and other material. Thus, under reason (3), the appellant used her "public office" when she used one of the agency's preprinted Federal Express airbills for personal business. Nevertheless, the agency has not shown that the appellant obtained any "private gain" from the transaction. The package the appellant deposited with Federal Express did not reach its intended destination. Rather, because of conflicting address information provided on the airbill by the appellant, the package was returned to the agency and the appellant's supervisor several days later. Although the parties stipulated that Federal Express airbills, when completed, obligated the agency to pay for the delivery service provided by Federal Express, there was arguably no delivery service provided here because the package was returned to the agency. The agency has not shown that it was billed for the package, and there is no dispute that the appellant eventually paid Federal Express $13.00 for the package.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of using one's public office for private gain cannot be sustained when no private gain has been shown. <span class="Italic">See Burkett v. General Services Administration</span>, 27 MSPR 119, 121-22 (1985) (the agency was not required to show gain, and proved its charge of <span class="Italic">attempted</span> use of public office for private gain, where it established that a Building Manager, using her position in the government, ordered, but later canceled or returned, building materials that she intended to use to restore a personal residence); <span class="Italic">Burnett v. U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 11 MSPB 559, 13 MSPR 311, 313-15 (1982) (where no actual gain was proven, the agency was only able to prove its charge of creating the appearance of using public office for private gain). Thus, the proven facts in this appeal do not result in the agency having met its burden of proving reason (3)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marler v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 116, 123-24 (1993), indirectly analyzed misuse of office as to a charge that the appellant violated several agency regulations by making a loan to a coworker, with a provision for payment of interest, and undisclosed to the agency, so that the coworker could purchase property owned and sold by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, he entered into the improper financial relationship with the Rankes in part because of a longstanding friendship with the Richardsons rather than solely for personal gain. The appellant's financial loan was not directly related to any misuse of knowledge or authority connected with the appellant's official position with the agency. The appellant did not attempt to conceal the loan from the agency; his name was placed on the financial papers, and he was forthcoming with information when asked if he was the lender....</p>

Cir. 2021 NP) ("Based on these and other facts, the Board reasonably found that Ms. Sphatt improperly used her position and credentials to attempt to influence the petition process to aide her good friend and his wife, which here amounts to use for a form of personal gain, whether or not the adjudicator of the immigration matter was actually influenced."); <span class="Italic">Jackson-Fisher v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-15-0492-I-1 (NP 9/13/2022) (charge of workplace sales of commercial products: "5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7001.102(a)(2) forbids sales both for oneself and for any other person and thus, regardless of whether the appellant was selling the products on behalf of her cousin, she still violated the regulation. Second, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.702, an employee may not "use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of...relatives," among others. We agree with the administrative judge that this regulation prohibits the appellant's activities on behalf of her cousin and that, as part of her cousin's sales team, she improperly derived personal gain from the sales of the Mary Kay products."); <span class="Italic">Little v. TVA</span>, 20 MSPR 563, 564 (1984) (adverse action was sustained for, among other reasons, a request by a manager to another agency employee to have a city traffic ticket fixed; appellant created the appearance of using a position for private gain); <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 13 MSPR 311 (1982) (by cashing checks for a member of the Home, the appellant created the appearance of using a public office for private gain; however, the appellant's past record, coupled with circumstances demonstrating that the appellant did not know that cashing checks as a favor to the member would create an appearance of impropriety, led to mitigation from removal to a 30-day suspension); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Berman v.
