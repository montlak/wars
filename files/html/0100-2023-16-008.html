<p class="Body-Text">"The agency also has the burden of proving that OPM has approved the agency's performance appraisal system and any significant changes thereto, if the appellant raises such a challenge. <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (1999)." <span class="Italic">Towne v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 239, 245 n.5, 2013 MSPB 81 (2013). <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 563 F.3d 1326, 1330-32 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (modified at 571 F.3d 1363, <span class="Italic">post</span>, following remand, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 116 MSPR 331, 2011 MSPB 49 (2011) (Member Rose dissenting), post)), explained the analysis if a challenge is lodged to OPM approval of an appraisal system or significant changes to the system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standards and procedures governing OPM approval of performance appraisal systems appear uncertain and unclear. We believe it would be helpful to the Board and its staff, litigants before it, and government employees generally, if we clarify and restate the governing standards and principles on these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;As the Board has stated, Congress provided for agency performance appraisal systems and their approval by OPM in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">Daigle v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, 630 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, federal agencies are required to "develop" performance appraisal systems that "provide for periodic appraisals of job performance of employees" and that permit "removing employees who continue to have unacceptable performance but only after an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4302(a)(1), (b)(6). OPM is required to "review" all performance appraisal systems to "determine whether [they] meet[&#8197;] " the statutory requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1). If it determines that a system does not do so, it is to "direct the agency to implement an appropriate system or to correct operations under the system, and any such agency shall take any action so required." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1), (3). Pursuant to statutory rule-making authority, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4305, OPM has promulgated regulations that specify the numerous requirements for such systems, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204, and require it to "review and approve an agency's performance appraisal system(s)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.210.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset of its administration of these provisions, the Board required agencies to show, in every case as part of their defense to challenges to performance-based adverse actions taken pursuant to performance appraisal systems, that OPM had approved the system involved. In <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, however, the Board ended that requirement. It explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is no statutory requirement for renewing approval of an agency's performance appraisal system once in place, and we are unaware of any agency which has not received OPM approval of its performance appraisal system. Therefore, we conclude that it is no longer necessary to perpetuate an outmoded paperwork requirement. However, if an appellant alleges that there is reason to believe that an agency is not in compliance with the law, the Board may require an agency to submit evidence that it has received OPM approval of its performance appraisal system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. at 630-31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, agencies would be required to show OPM approval only if the employee alleges that "there is reason to believe" that OPM had not done so. Although <span class="Italic">Daigle</span> involved a performance-based denial of a within-grade pay increase, its rationale, ruling, and analysis are equally applicable to other performance-based adverse actions, including the removal here at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;The remaining questions are whether and on what basis OPM is required to approve changes or modifications in an agency's previously approved system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board pointed out in <span class="Italic">Daigle</span>, "[t]here is no statutory requirement for renewing approval of an agency's performance appraisal system once in place." On the other hand, the policy of requiring OPM approval of performance-appraisal systems also calls for OPM approval of significant changes in those systems. An OPM regulation requires agencies to submit to OPM "for approval" both "a description of its appraisal system[s] ...and any subsequent changes that modify any element of the agency's system(s) that is subject to a regulatory requirement in this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.209(a). OPM has not further articulated its standards for reviewing changes in previously approved plans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Labor</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 255 (1985), which involved an employee's removal for unacceptable performance, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, a review of the August 1981 changes establish that those changes significantly affected the rights of the agency's employees under its performance appraisal system. Even if we accept Agency Exhibit R-62 as the system under which appellant was removed, we would nevertheless find that that system contained substantive changes which were not approved by OPM in accordance with the July 7, 1981 OPM approval letter, which requires OPM review and approval of any subsequent changes covered by statute or regulation. We find that the changes made related to the establishment of performance standards under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204 and thus required OPM approval. Therefore, we find that the agency failed to show that the modified performance appraisal system under which it removed appellant was approved by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">27 M.S.P.R. at 258 (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the standard should be based on the nature of the changes. If an agency makes changes to a previously-OPM-approved performance appraisal system that significantly alter an employee's performance standards and obligations, OPM review of those changes is necessary to achieve compliance with the basic purpose underlying the OPM-approved requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Under the foregoing principles, neither the administrative record nor the Board's findings enables us to determine whether OPM was required to approve the amendments to the Department's performance appraisal system or whether it approved the changes in the system under which the removal action was taken against Dr. Adamsen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Adamsen recognizes that, in its letter of September 10, 1986, OPM approved the Department's performance appraisal plan that initially covered him. He contends, however, that thereafter the Department made changes in its plan, which it did not submit for OPM approval and which OPM had not approved, and that his removal was improperly effected under the changed plans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the end of the September 10 approval letter, OPM stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any proposed changes to the PMS plans must be submitted to this office for prior approval if the change would affect a provision of the plan covered by regulation or law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's administrative judge cited the 1986 letter. In that letter OPM "approved the agency's performance appraisal plan" and stated that "[t]he agency updated its performance appraisal plan in 1995, 1998, and 2003." <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, 2007 MSPB LEXIS 6995, at *12-13. The administrative judge stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n <span class="Italic">Daigle</span> the Board noted there was no statutory requirement for renewing OPM approval of an agency's performance appraisal system once it was in place, that [t]he Board has held that a letter from OPM stating that it had approved the agency's performance management system plan satisfies the agency's burden of affirmatively showing, by substantial evidence, that it had received OPM approval before undertaking the personnel action at issue. Thus, I find the agency has established, by substantial evidence, that its performance-based action against the appellant was taken under an OPM-approved performance appraisal plan at the time of the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at * 13 (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address the questions of what changes the agency made in its performance appraisal plan or whether those changes also required OPM approval.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the record before us, we cannot determine what changes the Department made in its performance appraisal plan, how significant those changes were, and what impact, if any, they had on the Department's determination that Dr. Adamsen's performance had been inadequate. We cannot tell whether the Department was required to, or did, submit those changes to OPM for approval or whether OPM approved them. Indeed, without knowing what Dr. Adamsen said about OPM's alleged failure to approve the changes in the Department's plan, we cannot determine whether his allegation of non-approval satisfied the <span class="Italic">Daigle</span> standard that he must allege that there was "reason to believe" that his agency was not in compliance with the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2879"></span>Accordingly, we vacate the Board's finding that the Department's removal of Dr. Adamsen was done pursuant to an OPM-approved plan, and remand to the Board for further development of the record on this issue and to make additional findings and conclusions in light of the augmented record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adamsen</span> was revised at the government's request to modify language in the decision that might have been read to call for OPM approval of changes in performance standards, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 571 F.3d 1363, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The government has filed a petition for panel rehearing seeking only a change in the following sentence in our opinion of April 23, 2009, reported at 563 F.3d 1326, 1331:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"If an agency makes changes to a previously-OPM-approved performance appraisal system that significantly alters an employee's performance standards and obligations, OPM review of those changes is necessary to achieve compliance with the basic purpose underlying the OPM-approved requirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the government, these words "could be read to require OPM approval for employees' performance standards. Such a requirement would be inconsistent with law and would dramatically expand OPM's duties beyond covering those required by statute and regulation." The government requests that we "delete the phrase, 'that significantly alter an employee's performance standards and obligations,' and replace it with the word, 'it.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our opinion, we did not intend even to suggest that OPM approval of employees' performance standards would be required. It is not. Because of the government's concern, however, we think it appropriate to change that language to eliminate any possible ambiguity suggesting that such OPM approval would be required--although not in the way the government suggests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, there is substituted for the above quoted language from our opinion, the following sentence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"If an agency significantly alters a previously-OPM-approved performance appraisal system, OPM review of the agency's modifications is necessary to achieve compliance with the basic purpose underlying the OPM-approval requirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In all other respects, our opinion remains unchanged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Adamsen</span> led to a remand to the Board to determine whether or not Agriculture established OPM approval of the appraisal system. The Board decided the agency did not meet its burden of proof and reversed the Chapter 43 termination action, in part because of insubstantial form of proof offered by the agency, <span class="Italic">Adamsen v. USDA</span>, 116 MSPR 331, 333-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-19, 2011 MSPB 49 (2011) (Member Rose dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a General Schedule (GS) employee, is among the employees covered under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 subchapter I. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(2); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.202(a)(2). Under that subchapter, agencies are required, under regulations prescribed by OPM, to create performance appraisal systems that provide for periodic appraisals of job performance for covered employees and also permit their removal for unacceptable performance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a)(1), (b)(6); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204. OPM is required to review all such performance appraisal systems to determine whether they meet the requirements of the subchapter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.210. If OPM determines that the system does not meet statutory and regulatory requirements, OPM is to "direct the agency to implement an appropriate system or to correct operations under the system, and any such agency shall take any action so required." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4304(b)(1), (3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.210(c). Pursuant to its statutory rule-making authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4305, OPM has promulgated regulations that specify the requirements for performance appraisal systems, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204, and require it to review and approve such systems. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.210. OPM's implementing regulations further require an agency to "[s]ubmit for approval a description of its appraisal system(s) as specified in &#x00A7; 430.204(b) of this subpart, and any subsequent changes that modify any element of the agency's system(s) that is subject to a regulatory requirement in this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, in order to take a removal action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 subchapter I, the agency must first obtain OPM approval of the applicable performance appraisal system, including any significant changes made to a previously approved system. <span class="Italic">See Adamsen,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364; <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of the Army,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 657, 661-62 (1984).[1] Ordinarily, the Board will presume that the agency is in compliance with this requirement, but where, as here, an appellant alleges that there is reason to believe the agency has not received OPM approval for its performance appraisal system or any significant changes to an approved system, it is the agency's burden to demonstrate that it has received the necessary approval. <span class="Italic">Adamsen,</span> 563 F.3d at 1330-31; <span class="Italic">Lee v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> decision notes that the appeal was resolving "significant issues common to a large number of appeals [then] before the Board under 5 U.S.C.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The dissent states the appellant "has not identified any specific reason to believe the agency did not obtain approval for bulletin 430-1," suggesting that he failed to meet the <span class="Italic">Daigle</span> standard: "the appellant merely insists on holding the agency to its burden of proof." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 8. As thoroughly explained by the administrative judge, however, including the agency's failure to produce in response to discovery any evidence that OPM had approved the applicable appraisal system, the appellant plainly met the <span class="Italic">Daigle</span> standard as explained in <span class="Italic">Mahaffey v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 7 n.6 (2007) and <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v.

The agency thus was required by law to meet "its burden of proof" and establish by substantial evidence that its performance-based removal was based on a performance appraisal plan reviewed and approved by OPM. The appellant cannot be required to prove that the appraisal system was not approved. <span class="Italic">See Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 662 n.4, 663. The failure to have an approved appraisal system is not a trivial matter, as the failure to base unacceptable performance decisions upon standards established as part of an OPM-approved appraisal system could result in a prohibited personnel practice.<span class="Italic"> See Wells v. Harris,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 208, 229-230, 243 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency must show OPM approval by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">Lee,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 663.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Universal Camera,</span> the Supreme Court considered the standard for judicial review of factual findings under the federal Administrative Procedure and Taft-Hartley Acts. In noting that both statutes contained similar language requiring a reviewing court to find "substantial evidence" based on review of the "whole record," the Court concluded that Congress's inclusion of the direction to "consider the whole record" was a strong signal that the courts must do more than rubber stamp an agency's factual findings. <span class="Italic">Universal Camera,</span> 340 U.S. at 487-90.

Given the similarity in the definition of "substantial evidence" discussed in <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> and that applicable to Board appeals of performance-based removals, this discussion in <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> suggests the proper scope of the Board's review for "substantial evidence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bradley,</span> 900 F.2d at 234 (emphasis added).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The dissent criticizes our discussion of <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> in part because it quotes the legislative history from the Taft-Hartley Act of "some sixty-five years" ago. As we noted, <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> has been relied on by our reviewing court to explain that substantial evidence requires more than a "suspicion of the fact to be established." We believe the citation to <span class="Italic">Universal Camera</span> by the Federal Circuit further suggests that our substantial evidence review should result in more than a rubber stamp for suspicion and speculation. The dissent has failed to provide any authority for the more deferential standard of "substantial evidence" review it suggests, other than general references to <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy,</span> 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) and <span class="Italic">Gende v.

As <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> explains, before the CSRA agencies essentially had to take the equivalent of chapter 75 adverse actions for performance, but in two separate time-consuming stages. Simplifying the process and lowering the burden of proof to "substantial evidence" for performance-based actions does not suggest that Congress intended "substantial evidence" to be a meaningless standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that by letter dated September 10, 1986, OPM approved the agency's plan for a performance appraisal system required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. OPM also approved the agency's plan for the performance appraisal system for Senior Executive Service (SES) employees required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312. The September 1986 letter further stated that "[a]ny proposed changes to the...plans must be submitted to this office for prior approval if the change would affect a provision of the plan covered by regulation or law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In another letter, also dated September 10, 1986, OPM approved the agency's plan for a third performance appraisal system, then required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302a, for employees under the now-obsolete Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS).[5] On July 31, 1987, the agency issued Personnel Letter No. 430-15, which set out all three performance appraisal systems in a single document. It is undisputed that the appellant, then a GS-11, was covered by the provisions of Personnel Letter No. 430-15 that applied to non-SES, non-PMRS employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Title II of the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-615 (Nov. 8, 1984), established the PMRS as a distinct performance management system covering supervisors and management officials within grade GS-13, GS-14, or GS-15. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 201(a), <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5401-10 (1985). Under the Act, agencies were required to create performance appraisal systems for PMRS employees, and to establish performance standards review boards charged with, among other things, assessing the appropriateness of PMRS performance standards.<span class="Italic"> Id,</span> &#x00A7; 202(a); <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302a (1985). Notably, PMRS performance appraisal systems provided for a fixed appraisal period and an opportunity to respond in writing to an initial rating and obtain review of the rating by an employee at a higher executive level than the supervisor who issued the rating.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 30, 1993, Congress passed the Performance Management and Recognition System Termination Act, Pub. L. 103-89 (Sept. 30, 1993), abolishing the PMRS effective November 1, 1993, including its performance appraisal provisions. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00A7; 3(b)(1)(B) (striking 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302a). As a consequence, employees formerly covered under PMRS became subject to the statutory requirements for performance appraisal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. OPM in turn eliminated the PMRS performance appraisal regulations formerly codified at 5 C.F.R. part 430 subpart D. 58 Fed. Reg. 65531 (Dec. 15, 1993). In doing so, OPM stated that agencies could choose to keep their PMRS performance management plans for supervisors and management officials in grades 13-15, with certain preapproved technical revisions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Otherwise, OPM indicated, "agencies should inform OPM and former PMRS employees if they would be covered by the components of their Performance Management Plans used for other General Schedule Employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 16, 1995, the agency issued Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1, updating the performance appraisal system for non-SES employees required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and 5 C.F.R. part 430 subpart A.[6] All employees formerly covered by the PMRS were now covered under the updated performance appraisal system, which deleted all references to PMRS and made no special provisions for employees who were or would have been covered under PMRS. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the agency elected not to preserve a distinct PMRS performance management plan. In addition to expanding the class of employees covered by the non-SES performance appraisal system, the agency made another significant change by permitting sub-agencies to establish a three or four-tiered summary rating system instead of the five-tiered system mandated by Performance Letter No. 430-15. <span class="Italic">Compare id.,</span> &#x00A7; 2-7(a)(3) ("performance may be rated using either three, four, or five summary rating levels") <span class="Italic">with</span> RAF, Tab 17, Appellant's Exhibit 3, &#x00A7; 2-7(a)(3) (defining "five required summary rating levels"). The performance appraisal system was also updated to incorporate revisions to Personnel Letter No. 430-15 published in Personnel Letters No. 430-16 and No. 430-17, but, as the latter two documents are not in the record, we cannot ascertain the nature of those revisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;We note there is no agency letter, memo or other written document in the record forwarding to OPM for approval Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 or the agency's performance appraisal system contained in the bulletin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cover page to Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 issued on November 16, 1995, states that "[on] September 10, 1986, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) approved the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Performance Management Plan" and that "[a] committee to draft a USDA Performance Management System has been formed, and upon Office of Personnel Management approval, mission areas will be able to design their own Performance Management programs within the parameters of the Departmental System."[7] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The record shows that the agency periodically reviewed Personnel Bulletin 430-1 for currency but made no further changes to its non-SES performance management system until October 1, 2007, after the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The Board has held that an agency regulation stating its performance appraisal system was approved by OPM, in the absence of rebuttal by an appellant, is sufficient to find that an agency has met its burden of showing that it took its action under an OPM-approved system. <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 556 n.* (1985); <span class="Italic">see Chennault v. Department of the Navy,</span> 796 F.2d 465 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (same). As just explained, Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 noted that the agency's "Performance Management Plan" was approved on September 10, 1986. Section 1-1a of Personnel Bulletin 430-1 also states that the regulations in Chapter 430 "constitute the Department's Performance Appraisal Plan" and "[t]his Plan has been approved by OPM...." As Personnel Bulletin 430-1 was issued in November 1995, the OPM approval mentioned in section 1-1a could not be in reference to an alleged OPM approval letter later issued in January 1996. The overall language of the Bulletin suggests that the agency did not believe it needed any approval of Personnel Bulletin 430-1 apart from the September 10, 1986 OPM approval of its earlier performance appraisal system. In spite of this language in Personnel Bulletin 430-1, the dissent repeats the unsubstantiated finding of the administrative judge that the Bulletin itself "contains a statement that the agency intended to submit the bulletin for OPM approval." We find no such statement. The Bulletin describes itself as "the Performance Appraisal component of the USDA Performance Management Plan" that "the [OPM] approved" "[o]n September 10, 1986." The Bulletin's vague reference to seeking "Office of Personnel Management approval" of a future "Performance Management System" to be drafted by a "committee" that had been "formed" does not suggest that the agency intended to seek OPM approval for the Performance Appraisal Plan that OPM had, according to the same Bulletin, already approved in September 1986.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The cover page to the Bulletin also plainly states that employees will be "covered by the provisions of this plan until a new program is approved" and contained an "EXPIRATION DATE [of] January 31, 1998," also suggesting an agency belief that OPM approval was not needed before implementation of the plan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before us then is whether the agency established by substantial evidence that it obtained OPM approval for the significant changes it made to its non-SES performance appraisal system in Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1. <span class="Italic">See Adamsen,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364. Substantial evidence of an agency's performance appraisal system may consist of documentary and/or testimonial evidence.<span class="Italic"> Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 663. "Such evidence may be presented...in various forms, such as a letter from OPM stating its approval or an affidavit to that effect by an agency official with knowledge of the approval." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> n.5. After considering the record as a whole, we agree with the appellant that the agency did not make the required showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For reasons unexplained in the record, the agency failed to produce a letter from OPM approving the changes set forth in Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 or any other direct evidence that the agency obtained the requisite approval.[9] The agency instead relies on the December 16, 1996 letter from an OPM official, Doris Hausser, which states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is in response to your letter of December 5, 1996, submitting technical revisions to the attachment of the United States Department of Agriculture appraisal system approved on January 31, 1996. The revised attachment is accepted and has been appended to the original OPM Form 1631, replacing the attachment originally submitted with the OPM Form 1631.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;This is especially troubling in light of the issues identified in the Federal Circuit's decision, the agency's clear burden to establish approval of its performance appraisal system and any significant changes, and considering that such evidence would likely be in the agency's control or within its ability to obtain from OPM. <span class="Italic">See Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 662 (an agency is required to affirmatively prove OPM approval because "[i]nformation regarding such approval is peculiarly within the knowledge of the agency.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may be possible to infer from Ms. Hausser's letter that OPM approved a performance appraisal system of some kind on January 31, 1996. However, we conclude that this letter creates nothing more than a suspicion that OPM approved the November 1995 appraisal system applicable to the appellant. As the appellant observes, there is nothing in Ms. Hausser's letter to indicate that the appraisal system "approved on January 31, 1996" was the one described in Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1. The letter does not cite Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 by name or make any reference to non-SES employees. <span class="Italic">Cf. Alexander v.

Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 13 (2004) (inferring OPM approval of performance appraisal system based on OPM's reference to an agency letter requesting approval of "appraisal documents covering Senior Executive Service employees and general workforce employees"). Nor does the letter cite any statutes or regulations--e.g., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 or 5 C.F.R. part 430 subpart B--that would indicate the appraisal system in question was the one for non-SES employees, such as the appellant, as opposed to the performance appraisal system for SES employees which the agency issued separately on August 4, 1994. In short, it is impossible to ascertain from Ms. Hausser's letter itself what appraisal system OPM may have approved on January 31, 1996. This lack of clarity perhaps could be resolved by examination of the OPM Form 1631 or the December 5, 1996 letter to which Ms. Hausser refers, but the agency did not provide either these documents.<span class="Italic"> Cf. Lee,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 25 (the agency submitted evidence of OPM approval in the form of a copy of the agency's approval request, the OPM letter granting that request, and the OPM Form 1631).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be proper for the agency to support its contention that OPM approved its November 1995 performance appraisal system with an affidavit or declaration from a credible witness with actual knowledge of the approval. Indeed, probative hearsay evidence may meet the substantial evidence standard. <span class="Italic">Griffin,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. at 663 n.5, <span class="Italic">citing Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 77 (1981). The agency provided an "affidavit" by Anita Adkins, senior policy Human Resources Specialist, who states that "[b]y letter dated January 31, 1996, Doris Hausser, Chief Performance Manager and Incentive Awards Division, OPM acknowledged approval of USDA's system." However, Ms. Adkins did not become responsible for the agency's non-SES performance management policy until April 2006, and she plainly was not personally involved in the relevant events of 1995 and 1996.<span class="Italic"></span> Although Ms. Adkins states she reviewed "available files," she does not identify what files were or were not available, she does not assert that she personally saw or examined the alleged January 1996 OPM approval letter, nor does she otherwise explain the factual basis for asserting that OPM approved "USDA's [performance management] system" in a letter dated January 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are cognizant that, in appropriate circumstances, an unrebutted affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury may prove the facts it asserts. <span class="Italic">See Schaefer v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989) (affidavit); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 (1986) (declaration under penalty of perjury). However, Ms. Adkins's alleged "affidavit" woefully fails to meet the requirements of an affidavit because it was not sworn before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths. The statement also fails to meet the requirements of a declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746, as it was not signed "under penalty of perjury"; Ms. Adkins's statement merely states: "I hereby declare that the information contained in the above Affidavit is true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1746(2); <span class="Italic">see e.g., Caretolive v. Food &#x0026; Drug Administration,</span> 2011 WL 43646 (6th Cir., January 6, 2011), slip op. at 7. It is therefore nothing more that an unsworn statement, which we find entitled to little weight for the reasons we explain below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although hearsay evidence such as Ms. Adkins's statement may be admissible in Board proceedings, assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 83-87. The Board generally evaluates the probative value of hearsay by considering various factors that include the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing, whether the out-of-court statements were sworn, whether the declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events and whether their statements were routinely made, the consistency of the out-of-court statements with other statements and evidence, whether there is corroboration or contradiction in the record, and the credibility of the out-of-court declarant. <span class="Italic">Vojas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 13 (2011); <span class="Italic">see Social Security Administration v. Long,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Borninkhof,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 87).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Adkins's unsworn statement, identifying no firsthand knowledge of the relevant events and no factual basis to support a claim that OPM had issued a letter in January 1996 approving the agency's November 1995 performance appraisal system, is on its face unreliable hearsay. We have considered the statement in light of the agency's significant, unexplained failure to produce any letter from OPM approving the updated performance appraisal system described in Personnel Bulletin 430-1. Especially also considering that the agency was able to produce OPM approval letters for both the appraisal system that originally covered the appellant and the system in effect after the appellant's removal, we do not find Ms. Adkins's unsworn, unsupported statement to be probative in establishing the requisite OPM approval for the agency's November 1995 appraisal system. Therefore, we give little weight to Ms. Adkins's statement.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Ms. Adkins has identified no personal knowledge of the critical fact she asserts, i.e., OPM approval of the agency's performance appraisal system. She admittedly was not present during the relevant time period, she does not state she has personally seen the January 1996 letter, she does not identify any other basis for her to have personal knowledge of this crucial fact, and her statement was not given under oath or in the proper form for a declaration under penalty of perjury. Federal Rules of Evidence 602, providing guidance to the Board, states, in part: "A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter." We therefore give little weight to Ms. Adkins's similarly weak unsworn statement, lacking an adequate description of her personal knowledge. We further note that we have considered Ms. Adkins's unsworn, unsubstantiated assertion that OPM had approved the agency's performance appraisal plan in light of the agency's failure to produce the alleged January 31, 1996 OPM letter of approval, even though the administrative judge below granted the appellant's motion to compel the agency to produce such documentation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reasonable person might conclude that the mere temporal proximity between the November 15, 1995 issuance of Personnel Bulletin No. 430-1 and the January 31, 1996 date mentioned in Ms. Hausser's December 1996 letter provides some evidence that OPM approved the non-SES appraisal system that covered the appellant. This timing alone, however, creates no more than a suspicion that OPM approved the performance appraisal system issued in November 1995. We therefore find, considering the record as a whole, that a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion that OPM had, in fact, approved the agency's November 1995 performance appraisal system contained in Performance Bulletin 430-1. The agency thus has failed to meet its burden of proving by substantial evidence that OPM had approved the performance appraisal system applicable to the appellant at the time it took its removal action.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The dissent asserts that "the Board has previously accepted <span class="Italic">similar evidence</span> as substantial evidence that OPM had approved an agency's performance management system," citing<span class="Italic"> Ebron v. Department of the Army,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 126, 128 (1985) (emphasis added). We disagree. Close examination of <span class="Italic">Ebron</span> and an earlier case it relied on, <span class="Italic">Wapinski v. Department of the Army,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 616, 619-20 (1985), shows that the meager evidence submitted by the agency here is not similar to what the Department of the Army submitted in those two cases. In <span class="Italic">Ebron,</span> the Board noted it had previously held in <span class="Italic">Wapinski</span> that the same evidence later presented in <span class="Italic">Ebron</span> was sufficient to establish proof of OPM approval. <span class="Italic">Ebron,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. at 128. <span class="Italic">Ebron</span> explained that the record contained the following evidence: (1) A September 5, 1980 letter from OPM stating that the agency's performance system was approved if certain revisions were made; (2) a March 23, 1984 letter from OPM indicating that <span class="Italic">the</span> plan was approved; (3) an <span class="Italic">affidavit</span> by the agency's Employee Relations Specialist stating that she had personally revised the appraisal plan, forwarded the amended plan to OPM on September 24, 1980, and that OPM had informed her the plan was approved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We would have little difficulty finding the agency here has met its burden to establish OPM approval of its performance appraisal system if it had presented similar evidence to what the Army provided in <span class="Italic">Ebron and Wapinski.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency failed to establish by substantial evidence that it had obtained OPM approval for the significant changes it made to its performance appraisal system under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, its removal action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Adamsen,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364; <span class="Italic">Lee,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 24 (citing<span class="Italic"> Cole v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 564, 565 n.* (1985)) (the harmful error doctrine does not apply to the issue of OPM approval of an agency's performance appraisal system).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 255, 258 (1985), cited in the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Adamsen</span> decision, set aside a performance action when the agency failed to submit changes it made in appraisal system for evaluation of whether they were sufficiently substantive to require OPM approval. As to the plan submitted by the agency--containing some changes not approved by OPM--the Board concluded that the action was invalid because "those changes significantly affected the rights of the agency's employees under its performance appraisal system." <span class="Italic">Salmon v. SSA</span>, 663 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>, describes what amounts to OPM approval of skeleton plans.
