<p class="noindent">In a case that developed before and concluded after<span class="Italic"> TRACON</span>, the union pursued a grievance complaining that a manager used physical force against a unit employee. The grievance requested, among other things, the remedy of discipline against the manager. The union requested any information relating to previous discipline against the supervisor. FLRA compelled disclosure of the information and provided insight into the approach it follows concerning requests involving limited disclosures of disciplinary information for use in grievances against managers, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 38 FLRA 410, 416-20 (1990) (remanded, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223, 1224 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>, remanded to ALJ, 45 FLRA 120 (1992), following remand, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 51 FLRA 675 (1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>, enforced, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 104 F.3d 1396, 1400-02 (D.C. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's contention that the information was not necessary because the grievance seeks a remedy that cannot lawfully be granted by the arbitrator....&#8197;[T]he Union needs the requested information to evaluate the grievance, decide whether to pursue it, and to prepare for the arbitration proceedings. These bases on which we conclude that the requested information is necessary are independent of the issue of whether an arbitrator may properly order that the supervisor involved in this case should be disciplined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitration hearing for which the information was requested is in abeyance.&#x2003;There has been no determination by an arbitrator as to whether the Union's grievance is meritorious and no decision as to the remedy, if any, to be granted if the grievance is sustained. The Respondent may raise any claims concerning the legality of the arbitrator's award in this matter...by timely filing exceptions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[D]isclosure of the requested information is not prohibited by the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act generally prohibits the disclosure of personal information about Federal employees without their consent....&#8197;However, exception (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the information is required under the FOIA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(2). The FOIA provides that records must be disclosed on request unless the records are subject to a specific exemption. Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA provides that information contained in personnel files may be withheld if disclosure of the information would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."...&#8197;In determining whether the disclosure of personal information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the employee's right to privacy must be balanced against the public's interest in disclosure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In balancing the public's interest in disclosure against the supervisor's privacy interest, we find that the public's interest in the disclosure of the final decision letter or its equivalent to the Union as the exclusive representative of the grievant outweighs the personal privacy interest of the grievant's supervisor. As found above, the disclosure of the final decision letter, or its equivalent, on any proposed discipline of the grievant's supervisor was necessary...because it would enable the Union to process the grievance....&#8197;The disclosure of such information to the Union also would permit the Union to determine whether the Agency is complying with its responsibilities in administering its disciplinary system in a fair and evenhanded manner. The Authority has found that the release of information which is necessary for a union to perform its statutory representational functions promotes important public interest....&#8197;In addition, the release of information necessary to ensure that the Agency complies with its responsibilities in administering its disciplinary system in a fair and evenhanded manner involves matters of public concern....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Authority has previously found that employees have a privacy interest in disciplinary and adverse actions taken against them....&#8197;However, as applied to the specific facts of this case, that interest is not as compelling as the interest of the Union that has been established here....&#8197;[T]he Union...was already aware that some action had been taken against the supervisor. Thus, the stigmatizing effect of the action...had already occurred. Disclosing the nature of the disciplinary or adverse action would not significantly increase that effect....&#8197;[D]issemination of the information was unlikely to go beyond those persons directly concerned with the arbitration proceeding. Lastly, the disclosure does not involve a blanket request for all notices of proposed actions and final decision letters or encompass a large number of individuals....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Even if disclosure is prohibited under exception (b)(2) of the Privacy Act, it is authorized under exception (b)(3), which permits disclosure of information for a "routine use."

<p class="noindent">On subsequent review in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223, 1224-25 (D.C. Cir. 1992), the court sent the case back to FLRA to ascertain whether, because of privacy interests, the disclosure of the information concerning the supervisor ought to await a determination by an arbitrator that the union's grievance--seeking discipline against the supervisor--was grievable. If an arbitrator ruled that the grievance was not arbitrable, then avoidance of premature disclosure would not compromise the supervisor's privacy interests. Premature disclosure would serve no benefit to the union. The court did not explain why the union's interest would not be served by an earlier disclosure, if that disclosure showed the management had disciplined the supervisor to a degree that satisfied the union so that no further pursuit of the grievance was necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> was again before FLRA, and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 51 FLRA 675, 675-94 (1995), reaffirmed the duty of management to disclose to the union information about discipline of the supervisor. FLRA imposed some limitations on the right of the union to disseminate the information it received by restricting disclosure "to those individuals whose knowledge of the [final decision] letter's contents is critical to the purposes for which the information was requested":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority pursuant to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223 (D.C.

The Authority remanded the case to the Administrative Law Judge because the record was not sufficient to make the determinations required by the court's remand. <span class="Italic">Decision and Order on Remand</span>, 45 FLRA 120 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleges that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by refusing to provide the Union with documentation concerning disciplinary action taken against a supervisor who allegedly had used physical force against a bargaining unit employee. The Judge concluded that the Respondent violated the Statute as alleged. The Judge's supplemental decision is now before the Authority pursuant to exceptions filed by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) by refusing to release to the Union information that is necessary for the Union to determine whether to proceed to arbitration and is otherwise disclosable under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We modify the Judge's recommended order <span id="Page_384"></span>to condition the Respondent's obligation to provide the requested information on the Union's agreement to limit its dissemination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Facts</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As detailed more fully by the Judge in his supplemental decision and in our original Decision and Order, 38 FLRA 410 (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB I</span>), the Union seeks information concerning any disciplinary action taken against a supervisor for using physical force against a unit employee, as alleged in a grievance filed on behalf of the employee. The grievance also alleged that the supervisor had "a long history of erratic and volatile behavior" and that, because of the nature of the work involving "sharp knives, saws and other dangerous factors[,]" his "actions serve to create an improper and unsafe work environment." The grievance sought a remedy requiring the Respondent to give the supervisor a medical examination to determine his fitness to continue in his supervisory position and a 30-day suspension. In denying the grievance, the Respondent stated that management had proposed a written reprimand and that "[t]he process of disciplining a management official is not within the purview of the union."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the pre-arbitration step of the negotiated grievance procedure, the Respondent again denied the grievance, stating, in part, that "[a]ppropriate action has been taken regarding the supervisor involved in this grievance." After the Union invoked arbitration, it requested information concerning any disciplinary action taken against the offending supervisor "as referenced in" the Respondent's denial of the grievance. The Union stated that it needed the information "in order to prepare the case for arbitration, specifically in regards [sic] to the remedial actions requested." In response to the Respondent's request for clarification of the reason for the request, the Union stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We need this information to determine if the requested remedy of disciplinary action against the supervisor was in fact taken, and what that action was. Upon our review of this information, we may well conclude that no further action i[s] warranted in this case. In other words, we need this to assess the need to pursue arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent declined to provide the information because it "identified the supervisor by name." The arbitration hearing is in abeyance pending the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedural History</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB I</span>, the Authority agreed with the Judge's conclusion that all the information sought by the Union was contained in the final decision letter prepared by the Respondent regarding the discipline of the supervisor. 38 FLRA at 416. The Authority concluded that the Union was entitled to the final decision letter</p>
<p class="noindent-2">to evaluate the grievance, [to] decide whether to pursue it, and to prepare for the arbitration proceedings. These bases on which we conclude that the requested information is necessary are independent of the issue of whether an arbitrator may properly order that the supervisor involved in this case be disciplined.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 FLRA at 417.&#x2003;The Authority stated that because the requested information was necessary without regard to whether an arbitrator may order the discipline of the supervisor "the Respondent's claims concerning the appropriateness of the relief requested in the grievance did not relieve the Respondent of its obligation to furnish the Union with the requested information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The decision also concluded that disclosure of the requested information is not prohibited by the Privacy Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, the court remanded this case to the Authority for reconsideration in light of <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>). In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the court concluded that an agency need not disclose certain requested information to a union unless the union has a "'particularized need' for such information[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 534, and that the Statute requires consideration of the "'countervailing interests' against disclosure[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 531. In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, the court held that the Authority had not considered such countervailing interests. The court instructed the Authority, on remand, to "consider the [A]gency's interest, if any, in protecting the secrecy of its disciplinary decisions[,]" and "the supervisor's privacy interest against disclosing the letter." 956 F.2d at 1224-25. Finally, the court reiterated that a union may have a particularized need if it has "<span class="Italic">a grievable</span> <span class="Italic">complaint covering the information[,]</span> <span class="Italic">" id</span>. at 1225, quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532 (emphasis in original). The court instructed the Authority to consider "the interest in postponing disclosure until the grievability question is resolved." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Stating that it "express[ed] no view now on the Authority's Privacy Act analysis[,]" the court did not address the Agency's argument that disclosure is prohibited by the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Administrative Law Judge's Supplemental Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts are set forth fully in the attached supplemental decision.&#x2003;The Judge concluded that the "countervailing interests" identified by the court do not outweigh the Union's interest in immediate disclosure of the final decision letter. The Judge reasoned that the letter "addresses directly the basis of the grievance[,]" and that, therefore, the Union's need to know how management dealt with the incident that gave rise to the grievance "is as 'particularized' a need as is imaginable." The Judge denied the Respondent's request for a protective order confining access to the information to a small group of individuals within the Union, based on his concern that such an order could not be enforced. Nonetheless, the Judge admonished the Union that "the information should not be disseminated beyond those with a demonstrated need for it." As the Authority's remand requested only that the Judge take additional evidence in the areas set out by the court in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, the Judge did not address whether the final decision letter is disclosable under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Final Decision Letter Is "Necessary" Within the</span> <span class="Italic">Meaning of Section 7114(b)(4</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytic Approach</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its remand, the court instructed the Authority to consider whether the requested letter is "necessary" in light of <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>. Recently, the Authority issued <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas</span> <span class="Italic">City</span>), which set forth the analysis we will follow for determining whether and how information must be disclosed under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 669-71. We held that a union making a request under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. We also stated that a union's need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must establish that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, we stated that when it denies an information request, the agency must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. The agency does not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need. In determining whether and/or how disclosure is required, the parties should consider alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both a union's information needs and an agency's interests in information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 671 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301 (1979) (<span class="Italic">Detroit Edison</span>) (employer's "willingness to disclose" requested information in a manner other than that requested by the union "satisfied its statutory obligations").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">The</span> <span class="Italic">Union Articulated and Established a</span> <span class="Italic">Particularized Need</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has maintained throughout these proceedings that it needs information regarding disciplinary action taken against the supervisor to assess whether to pursue a grievance to arbitration and to prepare for arbitration in the event arbitration is deemed necessary.&#x2003;It clearly stated this need in its original request for the information, which referenced its need "to prepare the case for arbitration[.]" In response to the Respondent's request for clarification, the Union reiterated that it needed the information to "assess the need to pursue arbitration." The Union also has consistently connected its need for the information to the Respondent's reliance on undisclosed "appropriate" action that, in denying the grievance, the Respondent asserted it had taken against the supervisor. In its clarification of the request for information, the Union stated the need "to determine if...disciplinary action against the supervisor was in fact taken, and what that action was."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Respondent's explanation for denying the grievance effectively created the Union's need for the requested information. If the Union concurs that the Respondent's action is adequate to remedy the grievance, there would be no further reason for the Union to pursue arbitration. If, on the other hand, the Union believes that the action taken was not appropriate to address the events giving rise to its grievance, it could decide to proceed to arbitration. The Respondent's refusal to disclose information about the action it has made relevant in denying the grievance effectively deprives the Union of any ability to independently <span id="Page_385"></span>determine whether arbitration is still needed to serve the interests of unit employees and to prepare for arbitration if it decides that arbitration is required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to longstanding precedent in both the private and Federal sectors, a union has a substantial interest in information that will assist it in determining whether to proceed to arbitration. <span class="Italic">For example, National Labor Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Board v. Acme Industrial Co.</span>, 385 U.S. 432 (1967) (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Industrial</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Helena District, Helena, Montana</span>, 39 FLRA 241, 252 (1991).[4] In general, one evident reason for this interest is the commitment of resources required when a grievance is submitted to arbitration.[5] In this case, the Union asserts that pursuing the grievance to arbitration would be relatively expensive and that, if it did so, its "limited funds" would preclude the arbitration of some other grievance. In addition, although the cost of a preliminary hearing to resolve grievability questions would probably be less than that of a full hearing on the merits, even this expense is avoidable in the event the Union decides, on the basis of the final decision letter, to withdraw or resolve the grievance.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Similarly, a union has a substantial interest in information that will assist it in preparing a grievance for arbitration. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New England Region, Burlington, Massachusetts</span>, 38 FLRA 1623, 1629-30 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Industrial:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-3">[a]rbitration can function properly only if the grievance procedures leading to it can sift out unmeritorious claims. For if all claims originally initiated as grievances had to be processed through to arbitration, the system would be woefully over-burdened. Yet, that is precisely what the respondent's restrictive view would require. It would force the union to take a grievance all the way through to arbitration without providing the opportunity to evaluate the merits of the claim. The expense of arbitration might be placed upon the union only for it to learn that the machines had been relegated to the junk heap. Nothing in federal labor law requires such a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">385 U.S. at 438 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note the Judge's conclusion that he "would expect" the cost of a hearing to determine grievability to be "about $1,000 or less." Although the Respondent contends that the Union exaggerated the costs of such a proceeding, it does not dispute the Judge's estimate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having relied, in denying the grievance, upon the action it had already taken, the Respondent has made this action central to the Union's determination whether to proceed to arbitration. Accordingly, we are persuaded that the Union needs the letter to adequately represent its members. The Union has both articulated and established a particularized need for this information, without which it is unable either to make an informed judgment whether to challenge the Respondent's denial of the grievance or, if necessary, to prepare for arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Countervailing Interests</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its remand, the court directed the Authority to consider three non-disclosure interests: the Respondent's interest, "if any," in confidentiality; the supervisor's interest in privacy; and "the interest in postponing disclosure until the grievability question is resolved." <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d at 1225. As no further countervailing interests have been asserted, we address these three interests in maintaining the secrecy of the final decision letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management's Interest in Confidentiality</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the Agency has an interest in maintaining confidentiality about the action it has taken, the Respondent asserts that various problems would result from disclosure. These include: promoting employee disrespect for the supervisor, diminishing his credibility and effectiveness as a supervisor, and encouraging employee action that might provoke the supervisor into further acts of misconduct. However, the Respondent has offered nothing beyond its speculation about these possible outcomes. Such conjecture falls short of establishing any agency interests deserving of much weight. To illustrate the problem: one might as easily speculate that an agency would experience a salutary effect from disclosing information about its response to the widely-known assault of an employee by a supervisor at the workplace. For example, such information might increase respect for the Respondent's disciplinary process, or restore a sense of security that employees will be working in a safe environment. There is no basis in the record to establish that the speculative outcome proffered by the Respondent is more likely than other consequences that can be envisioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Supervisor's Interest in Privacy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the supervisor's personal interests, there is no question that every employee "has a significant privacy interest in his or her disciplinary records." <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d at 1225. As the Authority has found, an employee's privacy interest in disciplinary information is substantial because the release of that information can be embarrassing and stigmatizing to the employee. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Justice and Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 37 FLRA 1346, 1361-64, <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 38 FLRA 946 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Union seeks information only about specific disciplinary action taken against the supervisor for one instance of supervisory misconduct, which the record indicates is common knowledge among the employees and as to which the Respondent has already assured the Union it has taken "appropriate action." Thus, as the Authority stated in its initial decision in this case, "the stigmatizing effect of the [disciplinary] action...had already occurred" as a result of the Respondent's own disclosures and the widespread knowledge of the incident among the employees. 38 FLRA at 419-20.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We note that for purposes of assessing disclosure under the Privacy Act, the fact that otherwise private information may have been at one time or in some way known to the public does not diminish an individual's privacy interests in that information. <span class="Italic">Halloran v. Veterans Administration</span>, 874 F.2d 315, 322 (5th Cir. 1989). However, as in this case, prior disclosure may be relevant in determining whether such information is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, in the context of a particular request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent has established a strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the final decision letter in order to protect the supervisor's privacy interests in that information, it is possible in this case to satisfy the Union's need for disclosure in a way that recognizes these interests and mitigates the embarrassing or stigmatizing effects the supervisor might otherwise suffer. The Authority has previously stated that the parties should, and the Authority will, consider "alternative forms or means of disclosure that may satisfy both a union's information needs and an agency's interests in information<span class="Italic">." IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 671 (citing <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison</span>). In addition, the Respondent suggests in these proceedings that if disclosure is required, dissemination of the information contained in the decision letter should be limited. We conclude that in this case, and others where the union's interests are paramount, but asserted privacy interests are worthy of some protection, disclosure can be limited by placing constraints on dissemination of the released information. <span class="Italic">See</span> section VI below.[9] In so doing, we diminish the extent to which the Respondent's countervailing interests warrant precluding any disclosure at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that such constraints cannot be imposed to satisfy privacy interests under the FOIA or Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">Cf. National</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Retired Federal Employees v. Horner</span>, 879 F.2d 873, 875 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (court stated that, under FOIA, "information available to anyone is information available to everyone[&#8197;]" and "a court cannot limit the disclosure of records to particular parties or for particular uses[&#8197;]"). As explained above in note 8, the determination of necessity under the Statute involves a different analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Grievability</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under established law, an arbitrator has jurisdiction to address any matter that is within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United Steelworkers of</span> <span class="Italic">America v. American Mfg. Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 564, 568 (1960) ("The agreement is to submit all grievances to arbitration, not merely those which the court will deem meritorious."). It is undisputed here that the grievance is based on alleged harm to a unit employee, a matter that is clearly within the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11] Article XXI, Section 3 of the collective bargaining agreement defines a grievance as a request "for appropriate relief in a matter of concern or dissatisfaction which is subject to the control of the union or the employer" with certain exceptions not relevant here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with longstanding precedent, an arbitrator has the authority to address an alleged violation, even if the remedies available to correct that violation are limited. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Support Base, Pacific, Barstow</span>, <span class="Italic">California and American Federation of Government Employees AFL-CIO, Local 1482</span>, 3 FLRA 397, 399 (1980). Further, arbitrators have a wide latitude to fashion remedies.<span class="Italic"> See Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp.</span>, 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960) (arbitrators bring their "informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution to a problem[, which] is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies [where] the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations"). The fact that a union seeks a particular remedy does not, in and of itself, constrain the arbitrator's ability to fashion what he or she deems appropriate to any violation that is found. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Marvin F. Hill, Jr. &#x0026; Anthony V. Sinicropi, <span class="Italic">Remedies in Arbitration</span> 47 (2d ed. 1991) (unless a particular remedy is withdrawn from an arbitrator's authority, the arbitrator generally will be found to possess the power to make the award and fashion an appropriate remedy). Nor does it justify an assumption that an arbitrator's remedy <span id="Page_386"></span>will implicate a management right under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, for</span> <span class="Italic">example, Department of Justice, Federal Prisons Systems, El</span> <span class="Italic">Reno Federal Correctional Institution, El Reno, Oklahoma and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of</span> <span class="Italic">Prisons Locals, Local No. 171</span>, 35 FLRA 329, 338 (1990) (award did not interfere with management's rights because it did not require the agency to take or refrain from taking any action pursuant to its rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute). In short, we are aware of no basis on which to conclude that the relief sought by the Union in this grievance determines its grievability. Of course, pursuant to Section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, an agency can always file exceptions requesting review of any remedy that it considers to be inconsistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if an arbitrator were to consider the requested relief in determining grievability, the relief sought in this case does not necessitate a finding that the matter is not grievable. The Authority previously has upheld an award directing an activity to discipline a supervisor for misconduct toward an employee under his supervision. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 148 C-33</span>, 39 FLRA 1288 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied</span> 981 F.2d 1339 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Lewisburg</span>)<span class="Italic">. See also Veterans Administration Hospital, Fort Howard</span>, <span class="Italic">Maryland</span>, 11 FLRA 10, 11 (1983). In declining on jurisdictional grounds to review the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Lewisburg</span>, the court found "no specific provision in the [Statute) that, in clear and mandatory terms, prohibits an arbitrator from ordering an agency to discipline a supervisor, or that prohibits the Authority from affirming an arbitral award that mandates supervisory discipline." 981 F.2d at 1343. Indeed, the court stated, in <span class="Italic">dicta</span>, that "[t]he structure of the [Statute,] and prior case law in the FLRA and this circuit, suggest that the opposite is true. The [Statute] does not condition or limit an arbitrator's power to design remedies<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at n.2 (citation omitted). In addition, there is support in private sector labor law for the grievability of grievances seeking the discipline of supervisors in circumstances which may be deemed similar to the assault alleged in this case by a supervisor with "a long history of erratic and volatile behavior" in a workplace involving "sharp knives, saws and other dangerous factors." <span class="Italic">See</span> Elkouri and Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> 582-83 (4th ed. 1985) (a demand for discipline or discharge of a supervisor may be grievable "'in very extreme cases, where a foreman's conduct is beyond the limits of lawfulness or decency, making for an intolerable condition...'or where there is a menace to the life and health of the employees while at their work....'").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, in the event the Union decides to proceed to arbitration after it has had a chance to review the final decision letter, there is a significant likelihood that an arbitrator will find the grievance at issue in this case grievable.[12] We also conclude that any interests the Respondent may have in avoiding disclosure will probably not be served by postponing disclosure until grievability is determined. In reaching these conclusions, we have not taken lightly the court's admonition that the Respondent has "a strong interest in postponing disclosure until after...resolution [of the grievability issue]." <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d at 1225. However, for the reasons discussed above, if the Union pursues arbitration, the grievance is likely to be considered on its merits. In addition, the confidentiality and privacy interests identified by the court can be mitigated in this proceeding in a way that does not deny the Union information for the particularized need it has established. These interests can be protected by ordering limited disclosure with constraints on further dissemination of the released information by the Union. <span class="Italic">See</span> section VI below.[13] Taking into consideration all of the circumstances of this case, including our ability to mitigate the privacy and confidentiality concerns expressed by the Respondent, we have heeded the advice of the Supreme Court that basic labor law principles do not require a union to assume the expense of arbitration only so that it can determine whether arbitration is in fact necessary. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Industrial</span>, 385 U.S. at 569.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] We note that any determination by the arbitrator concerning grievability would, on exceptions, be subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Authority. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] In contrast, if release of the information were withheld pending an arbitral finding on the grievability issue, as suggested by the court, and an arbitrator resolved that issue in the Union's favor, the Union might then be free to divulge the confidential information regarding the supervisor's discipline to whomever it pleased.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union's Interests in Disclosure Outweigh the</span> <span class="Italic">Respondent's Countervailing Interests</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the particularized need established by the Union for the final decision letter against the Respondent's countervailing interests, we conclude that the Union's interests prevail. First, as we have determined above, the Union has established a substantial interest in the disclosure of the final decision letter to enable it to determine whether to process its grievance to arbitration and, if deemed necessary, to prepare for arbitration. In contrast, as discussed above, the Respondent's anti-disclosure interests are relatively weak because: (1) the rationale asserted on behalf of management's interest is speculative; (2) the otherwise strong privacy interests of the supervisor can be mitigated by an order limiting disclosure; and (3) it is likely that the grievance will be found to be grievable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union's particularized need for the final decision letter to determine whether to process the grievance to arbitration and to prepare for arbitration, if deemed necessary, outweighs the countervailing interests identified in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB </span>v.<span class="Italic"> FLRA</span>. Accordingly, the letter is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Privacy Act Does Not Bar Disclosure</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">It Is Necessary to Determine Whether the</span> <span class="Italic">Privacy Act Prohibits Disclosure</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Scott AFB I</span>, the Authority concluded that disclosure of the requested decision letter is not prohibited by the Privacy Act. Neither the court in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB v. FLRA</span> nor the Judge in the decision on remand addressed the Authority's Privacy Act analysis. After the Judge's decision issued, the U.S. Supreme Court decided <span class="Italic">Department of Defense</span>, holding that the relevant public interest in disclosure set forth in <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> applies to section 7114(b)(4) cases involving personnel data maintained in a system of records covered by the Privacy Act. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York Tracon, Westbury, New York and National Air Traffic Controllers Association, MEBA/NMU (AFL-CIO) New York Tracon Local</span>, 50 FLRA 338 (1995), the Authority applied <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span> and set forth the analytical approach we will follow in assessing an agency's claim that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these developments in the decisional law concerning the Privacy Act and the Respondent's contention that disclosure is prohibited under that statute, it is appropriate that we reevaluate our previous ruling on this issue. As discussed below, we agree with the General Counsel that the information is disclosable under the routine use exception to the Privacy Act. In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to determine whether release of the final decision letter would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA. We note that each exception to the Privacy Act operates independently. Thus, even if requested information is not disclosable under the FOIA exception, such information could be disclosed to a routine user under the routine use exception. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. U.S. Department of the Treasury, Financial Management Service</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1989) <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 493 U.S. 1055 (1990); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 234, 246 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Final Decision Letter Is Disclosable</span> <span class="Italic">Under the Routine Use Exception</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Respondent, the final decision letter requested in this case is contained in a system of records that encompasses information in employees' official personnel folders. This system of records is identified as OPM/GOVT-1. 57 Fed. Reg. 35698, 35705. OPM's routine use statement governing this system of records, identified as routine use "j," [15] provides that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation...." 57 Fed. Reg. 35706 (1992).[16] Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the final decision letter, we must decide whether the information contained therein is "relevant" and "necessary" within the meaning of routine use statement "j."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] The Respondent argues that the letter is not covered by a routine use notice because the notice relating to official personnel folders does not separately identify release of disciplinary records to unions as a routine use. The Federal Register notice covering OPM/GOVT-1 lists, as pertinent here, the following records that are in that system and, therefore, encompassed by routine use "j": "notices of <span class="Italic">all</span> personnel actions, such as...demotions...suspensions...and removals." 57 Fed. Reg. 35705 (1992) (emphasis added). Thus, we reject the Respondent's claim that release of disciplinary records in an official personnel folder is not covered by a routine use notice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16] Although the request in this case was made in 1987, the applicable routine use statement has not changed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 Fed. Reg. 36949, 36956 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued "guidance to agencies" for interpreting these terms in FPM Letter 711-164, which was published on September 17, 1992. When the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, the Letter, along with certain other parts of the FPM, was provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Little Rock</span>, <span class="Italic">Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA 216 (1995), we apply the FPM Letter's guidance in deciding this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_387"></span>The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that requested information is consistent with routine use "j": (1) the information must be "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information must be "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing, first, the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical" and "significant," [17] we have examined the record to assess whether the Union has established that the nature of the information requested can reasonably be attributed to and is likely to influence or affect the purpose for which the information was sought. We find that the final decision letter bears a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose of deciding whether to proceed to arbitration and to preparing for arbitration, if deemed necessary. The information it contains is the very information needed to enable the Union to decide whether and how to proceed with arbitration. The action taken by the Respondent--which this letter documents--became relevant when the Respondent relied on it to justify denying the grievance. We find, therefore, that the final decision letter is relevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17] According to Webster's Third New International Dictionary (unabridged) (1986), traceable is defined as "suitable or of a kind to be attributed: Due, Ascribable"; logical means "that is in accordance with inferences reasonably drawn from or proceeding or surrounding or predictable facts or events or circumstances"; and significant refers to "having or likely to have influence or effect." The Authority occasionally refers to dictionary definitions of terms to supply meaning where none has otherwise been provided. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 31 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wade Park Unit, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 49 FLRA 957, 958 n.2 (1994). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Depot, Texarkana, Texas v. FLRA</span>, 977 F.2d 1490, 1492 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (court found that Authority's adoption of dictionary definition of statutory term was permissible).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second standard, no party has asserted, and it is not otherwise apparent, that there are less intrusive means of satisfying the Union's needs. It is evident that the information itself cannot be conveyed in a way that conceals the supervisor's identity. At the first hearing it was determined, and it has not been contested, that the entire letter was "encompassed by the Union's request" and that no reason had been established for distinguishing portions of the letter with regard to the Union's needs or the Respondent's defenses. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB I</span>, 38 FLRA at 429, n.7. Accordingly, the record does not provide any basis for finding that there are less intrusive means of obtaining the information that are reliable and verifiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the final decision letter is disclosable under the routine use exception to the Privacy Act. As we have concluded that the letter is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4), and as all the other statutory requirements for disclosure of the requested information were either admitted or not disputed by the Respondent, <span class="Italic">see Scott AFB I</span>, 38 FLRA at 421, we conclude that the Respondent's refusal to furnish the Union with the final decision letter constitutes a failure to comply with section 7114(b)(4) and, thereby, a violation of section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Remedy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the relative strength of the parties' interests in this case, we have taken into consideration our ability to address the Respondent's countervailing interests without denying the Union the final decision letter for the limited purposes for which it was requested. We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the appropriate remedy for the violation of the Statute found above is to limit the dissemination of the final decision letter once it is released to the Union. In this regard, we note that the Respondent requested that we impose such conditions on release if we found a violation and no party has argued before us that such a remedy is inappropriate. In addition, although the Judge expressed concerns about the enforceability of the protective order requested by the Respondent, he admonished the Union to limit dissemination of the information to those with a demonstrated need for the letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our order that the Respondent furnish the letter therefore is conditioned upon the Union's agreement to limit further disclosure to those individuals whose knowledge of the letter's contents is critical to the purposes for which the information was requested.[18] Any matters involving the scope of this order should be resolved in compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18] We expect that this agreement between the parties will be made enforceable in the same manner as other contractual agreements between the Respondent and the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> was again reviewed and FLRA's decision was enforced, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 104 F.3d 1396, 1400-02 (D.C. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Particularized Need</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the bargaining agreement between Scott AFB and NAGE defines a grievance "as a request by any employee or group of employees acting as individuals, the union, or the employer for appropriate relief in a matter of concern or dissatisfaction which is subject to the control of the union or the employer." Amended Appropriated Fund Labor-Management Agreement between Scott Air Force Base, Illinois and NAGE, article XXI, section 3, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 30. Given the bargaining agreement's broad language, matters affecting workplace safety are clearly grievable. And physical abuse of employees by supervisors in the workplace surely is a matter relating to safety on the job. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Union sought redress under the collective bargaining agreement to protect against a supervisor assaulting employees on the job. Likewise, it is hardly surprising that the Union sought to see the disciplinary letter issued to the offending supervisor in order to determine whether to pursue arbitration. After all, it is difficult for a union to know whether a supervisor remains a threat to employees without knowing how the employer has treated the supervisor's prior offenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ruled that, although the disputed letter deals with the discipline of a supervisor (a nonbargainable issue), the main focus of the Union's grievance was to ensure the workplace safety of its bargaining unit employees. In other words, there is no question that there is a connection between an employee being struck by a supervisor and workplace safety-a bargainable subject; and the fact that a grievable subject may overlap on the edges with a nonbargainable subject does not eviscerate the grievability of the claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as the Authority correctly noted, <span class="Italic">see Scott II</span> at 9, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 300, the Union possesses a substantial interest in information that will assist it in determining whether to proceed to arbitration.[1] If the Union decides that the action taken against the supervisor is adequate to address its concerns over workplace safety, then the grievance can be dropped. Such a determination cannot be made, however, without information detailing how the employer handled the situation. This is not to say that the Union has the right to dictate personnel actions affecting supervisors, or to second-guess management decisions on supervisory discipline. However, when unit employees have faced physical assault on the job, a Union surely is entitled to know how management has handled the problem in order to assess whether to pursue arbitration over an issue of workplace safety.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Indus. Co.,</span> the Supreme Court aptly noted that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]rbitration can function properly only if the grievance procedures leading to it can sift out unmeritorious claims. For if all claims originally initiated as grievances had to be processed to arbitration, the system would be woefully overburdened. Yet, that is precisely what the respondent's restrictive view would require. It would force the union to take a grievance all the way through to arbitration without providing the opportunity to evaluate the merits of the claim. The expense of arbitration might be placed upon the union only for it to learn that the machines had been relegated to the junk heap. Nothing in federal labor law requires such a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">385 U.S. 432, 438 (1967) (internal footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Scott AFB argues that, in its request for arbitration, the Union has sought a remedy that would define the terms of the supervisor's discipline, a matter beyond the scope of bargaining. This is beside the point. What is important here is that the Union has the right to information that is necessary to determine whether to proceed to arbitration in an attempt to ensure the workplace safety of unit employees. The fact that certain "remedies" sought may not be available to the Union in arbitration does not render an otherwise grievable claim not arbitrable<span class="Italic">. See Marine Corps Logistics Support Base and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees,</span> 3 F.L.R.A. 397, 399 (1980). We need not address whether any remedy is even due the Union under the parties' agreement. Rather, we simply find that the Union's request to view the disputed disciplinary letter involves a clearly grievable subject-workplace safety-and, thus, the Authority's finding that the Union possesses a particularized need for the information is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Countervailing Interests</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> this court instructed the Authority to determine whether countervailing interests outweighed the Union's interest in viewing the disputed letter<span class="Italic">. See Department of the Air Force,</span> 956 F.2d at 1225. On the record at hand, we hold that the Authority was fully justified in finding that the countervailing interests do not defeat the Union's interest in disclosure of the letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In examining the interests weighing against disclosure, the Authority <span id="Page_388"></span>discounted Scott AFB's interest in maintaining confidentiality of its disciplinary records, noting that any resulting disrespect from employees toward the supervisor or any diminution of the supervisor's credibility was speculative<span class="Italic">. See Scott II</span> at 10, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 301. Further, the Authority, while recognizing that the supervisor possesses a substantial personal interest in maintaining the privacy of his disciplinary records, found that the Union seeks disclosure of only one specific disciplinary action that was taken with respect to an incident of misconduct that is already common knowledge amongst workers at the commissary<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 11, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 302. Finally, with respect to an interest in postponing disclosure of the letter until an arbitrator decides the grievability issue, the Authority noted that the Union's request for disclosure of the letter was clearly made in pursuit of a grievable subject<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 12, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> J.A. 303. Scott AFB simply disagrees with the Authority's weighing of the relevant factors, but this disagreement furnishes no basis upon which to grant a petition for review. We must defer to the Authority's judgment on these issues, for it is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Privacy Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A further issue in this case is whether the Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of the disputed letter.&#x2003;We review the Authority's interpretation of the Privacy Act <span class="Italic">de novo. See FLRA v. U.S. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 884 F.2d 1446, 1451 (D.C. Cir. 1989). We find that, as the Union's request falls within the Act's "routine use" exception, the Privacy Act does not bar disclosure of the disciplinary letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, ordinarily prohibits disclosure of personal information about federal employees without their consent. However, there are several exceptions to the Act's application. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 552a(b)(3) and (e)(4) set forth the routine use exception to the Privacy Act and require that all agencies that maintain a system of records publish identified routine uses in the Federal Register. The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") published notice of the system of records at issue in the instant case at 57 Fed. Reg. 35,698, 35,705 (1992). The OPM's routine use "j" authorizes</p>
<p class="noindent-2">disclos[ure of] information to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation concerning personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">57 Fed.&#x2003;Reg. 35,706 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM's interpretation of routine use "j" is entitled to "great deference" by this court, <span class="Italic">see Department of Treasury,</span> 884 F.2d at 1451, and that interpretation makes it clear that the Union is entitled to disclosure of the disputed letter in this case. In a September 17, 1992, policy letter, OPM interpreted routine use "j," in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Unions will often cite a generalized need for information about agency actions with respect to individual employees. For example, the union may ask for lists of employees who have been counseled or disciplined within a specific timeframe, stating that it needs the information in order to consider whether or not to file a grievance. Agencies must apply a two-step analysis in determining whether the requested information is releasable. First, the union must show that the information is "relevant" to carrying out its representational obligations. For example, a dispute may not be grievable under the parties' collective bargaining agreement and, if that is the case, information pertaining to it is not "relevant."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Second, if the agency determines that the information is "relevant," it must also determine that the information is in fact "necessary." The union must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> Office of Personnel Management Federal Personnel Management Letter 711-164 at 3 (Sept. 17, 1992), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Brief for the Petitioner at addendum C.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, the scope of the Privacy Act is not determined by reference to the commands of the Labor Statute. However, in this case, in accordance with OPM's interpretation of its routine use exception to the Privacy Act, whether the Union's request falls within the routine use "j" exception hinges on whether the Union's request is relevant and necessary to carry out its representational duties and, thus, on whether the claim is in pursuit of a grievable subject. As described above, because workplace safety is clearly grievable, the requested disciplinary letter is both relevant and necessary to the Union to carry out its representational duties and, thus, falls within OPM's routine use "j" exemption to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mootness</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, petitioner asserts that, because the alleged assaults by the supervisor occurred ten years ago and the grievant in question has since retired from the commissary, this court should dismiss the case on prudential mootness grounds, <span class="Italic">see Penthouse Int'l, Ltd. v. Meese,</span> 939 F.2d 1011, 1019-20 (D.C. Cir. 1991). In other words, petitioner urges that the release of the disciplinary letter will do nothing today to help the union ensure a safe work environment for its bargaining unit employees. We reject petitioner's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union, not the unit employee, decides whether and on what terms to proceed with arbitration. Therefore, the employee's retirement is not determinative of whether the Union has a viable claim to pursue in arbitration. Furthermore, in the instant case, the Union still possesses an interest in the workplace safety of its bargaining unit employees. Second, although the supervisor's objectionable behavior occurred ten years ago, the supervisor still works at the commissary. Therefore, the Union is entitled to consider whether the supervisor remains a threat to the workplace safety of the bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to "routine use" disclosures, FLRA declared, before the 1995 <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, New England Region and NAATS</span>, 38 FLRA 1623, 1632 (1991), concerning disclosure of the discipline records of supervisors:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Routine use disclosures are confined to "'ones that are 'compatible with the purpose for which [the information] was collected.' 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(7);...and, within the uses 'described under' 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(e)(4)(D).'"...&#8197;According to the Office of Personnel Management, personnel records are amassed in part to "establish employee rights and benefits under pertinent law and regulations governing Federal employment." 49 Fed. Reg. 36,955 (Sept. 20, 1984)....&#8197;[R]elease of the requested data in this case is fully consistent with the purpose for which it was collected....</p>
