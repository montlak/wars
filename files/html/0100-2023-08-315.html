<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-308"><span class="space">e.</span> Failure to Consider Employee for Vacant Positions; Nonpromotion; Manipulation or Abolition of Positions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 332.312 (2022), agencies are required to consider some belatedly-filed applications for positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applicants in military or overseas service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subject to the time limits and other conditions published by OPM in its operating manuals, the following persons are entitled to file applications for open competitive examinations after the closing date for receipt of applications when there is an existing register or a register about to be established:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;A person who could not file an application during the filing period, or appear for an assembled examination, because of military service, or hospitalization continuing for 1 year or less following discharge from military service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;An employee of the Federal Government who, as a member of a reserve unit of the military service, could not file an application during the filing period, or appear for an assembled examination, because of active duty beyond 15 days with the military service even though the duty is designated for training purposes; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;A United States citizen who could not file an application during the filing period, or appear for an assembled examination, because of overseas service with a Federal agency or with an international organization in which the United States Government participates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of applications from individuals on military duty, <span class="Italic">Grandberry v. DHS</span>, 108 MSPR 309, 312-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-17, 2008 MSPB 55 (2008) (on appeal concerning the remedy, <span class="Italic">Grandberry v. DHS</span>, 406 Fed. Appx. 472 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined that USERRA requires an agency to consider applications from employees on military duty for positions that are advertised during the employees' military absence, including during the time following the employees' return, through the time that a selection certificate is issued. Under <span class="Italic">Grandberry</span>, the problem for the agency was USERRA reemployment, rather than VEOA veterans preference, rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the administrative judge found that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312. That section provides that certain categories of individuals are entitled, under some circumstances, "to file applications for open competitive examinations after the closing date for receipt of applications...." Among those who may file applications after the normal deadline is a "person who could not file an application during the filing period...because of military service...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312(a). The administrative judge found, in effect, that the appellant's July 2005 application, and his inquiries in December 2005 and January 2006, constituted attempts to file an application under the April 2005 vacancy announcement, and that the agency violated the appellant's rights as a preference eligible when it "failed to allow [him] to file a late application...for the position of Adjudication Officer."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency challenges the administrative judge's finding that it violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312. Specifically, it argues that it did not prevent the appellant from filing a late application under the announcement in question, that the appellant's July 2005 application was a request for consideration for a veterans recruitment appointment, rather than an application filed under announcement FS236771, and <span id="Page_536"></span>that the appellant never filed an application under that announcement. It also asserts that the appellant did not pass or even take the tests that were required in order to be considered qualified for an adjudication officer position, and that nothing in the regulations requires an agency to hold a position open indefinitely while an individual completes the application process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not address these arguments on review. Even if the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312, such a violation would not provide a basis for granting the appellant's request for relief under VEOA. That Act provides the Board with authority to order relief when it "determines that an agency has violated a right described in" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. VEOA, Pub. L. No. 105-339, &#x00A7; 3, 112 Stat. 3182, 3184 (1998) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c). The rights to which this provision refers are those granted to a preference eligible "under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1). While 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 grants rights to persons based on their military service, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312(a), (b), it makes no distinction between persons with preference eligibility and those without it. In fact, it does not even refer to preference eligibility. It is not, therefore, a "regulation relating to veterans' preference...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2), an employee who has been absent from his civilian employment for more than 90 days in order to perform military service generally is entitled to be employed, on his return, in the position in which he would have been employed had his civilian service not been interrupted by his military service, or in a position of like seniority, status, and pay. This provision does not expressly and directly require that an agency consider the absent employee for promotions and other assignment opportunities that become available during his absence. The purpose of this and related provisions, however, is "to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301(a)(1). Moreover, courts have construed similar provisions, which governed situations such as this until they were amended in 1994, to mean that employees absent for military duty "must not be disadvantaged by [their employers'] failure to treat them as if they had been present at work." <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 142 F.3d 1444, 1446-47 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the 1994 amendments indicates that the current provisions are intended to provide even stronger protection against such disadvantages. <span class="Italic">See</span> H. Rep. No. 103-65, at 1 (1994), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 94 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2449 (legislation was intended "to improve reemployment rights and benefits of veterans and other benefits of employment of certain members of the uniformed services"); H. Rep. No. 103-65, at 17 (1994), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 94 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2450 (legislation would "[r]eaffirm that a protected individual is generally entitled to reemployment in the same position which would have been attained if he or she had been continuously employed," and would "[r]eaffirm that a person reemployed under chapter 43 is entitled to the seniority, and other rights and benefits determined by seniority, that would have been attained if he or she had remained continuously employed").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we note that regulations promulgated under the current statutory provisions require that employing agencies consider employees absent on military duty for promotions and other "incident[s] or advantage[s] of employment that they may have been entitled to had they not been absent," and that they require that employees who would have received promotions absent their military duty be restored at the higher levels to which they would have been promoted in their absence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, as discussed above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312(a) and (b) provide that individuals who could not file an application during the filing period because of military service are entitled to file applications for open competitive examinations after the closing date for receipt of applications. We note that section 332.312's introductory paragraph indicates that, subject to conditions established by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in its operating manuals, this provision only applies when there is an existing <span class="Italic">register</span> or a <span class="Italic">register</span> about to be established.[4] However, OPM's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, which provides guidance to agencies for filling competitive examination positions without the use of a <span class="Italic">register</span>, directs agencies to permit an applicant to file an application after the closing date if the <span class="Italic">inventory</span> of eligibles still exists or if an <span class="Italic">inventory</span> is about to be established. <a href="http://www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook2007/DEO_Handbook.pdf">www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook2007/DEO_Handbook.pdf</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>] . Specifically, Chapter 4 states that applications from persons who are entitled to file late should be accepted and processed up until the time that a certificate is issued. Thus, OPM has expanded the scope of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 to include positions filled by agencies under their delegated examining authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A "register" is defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(14) as "a list of qualified applicants compiled in order of relative standing for certification." By itself, this definition could be regarded as broad enough to apply to lists of names compiled for use on a one-time basis. Other regulations promulgated by the OPM indicate, however, that the term is used to refer to a standing or continuing list, used over an extended period of time to fill vacancies as they occur and are announced. For example, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.301 refers to events that may result in the termination of "a person's eligibility on a register," it provides that one such event is the acceptance of a career or career-conditional appointment from the register, and it provides that "OPM may determine that in particular types of cases eligibility may not be terminated in less than 1 year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that the above provisions entitle employees to be considered for positions that are advertised in the employees' absence for military duty, even when they are not actually filled until after the employees return to civilian employment. <span class="Italic">See McGuire v. United Parcel Service,</span> 152 F.3d 673, 676 (7th Cir. 1998) (statutory provisions governing reemployment rights following active-duty military service, whether those provisions were enacted before or as part of the 1994 amendments, are to be liberally construed in favor of those who served their country); <span class="Italic">Waidzunas v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant raised a reemployment claim under section 4313, and the administrative judge erred in not considering it below. Further, the administrative judge erred by not advising the agency and the appellant of their respective burdens applicable to such a claim. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of State,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 583, 'VII 10-13 (2007) (appeal remanded, in part, because the administrative judge erred addressing the appellant's reemployment rights claim under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313 without first advising the parties of their respective burdens). Therefore, the appellant's reemployment claim under USERRA is remanded for further adjudication. On remand, the parties should be given an opportunity to present argument on this claim. The administrative judge may exercise her discretion to reopen the evidentiary record if it is warranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chairman McPhie dissented in <span class="Italic">Grandberry</span>, arguing that the USERRA issue relative to positions vacant during an employee's military service was not properly before the Board and also arguing that the Board majority improperly interpreted USERRA, 108 MSPR at 317-20:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the majority opinion would hold that even though the appellant never cited to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313 in any of his submissions, the agency should now be forced to litigate this issue as if he had (because, in the majority's estimation "he has claimed throughout the proceeding that the agency violated USERRA by denying his right 'as a returning veteran' to consideration for promotion opportunities"). The AJ, however, did consider this claim extensively. The AJ construed the appellant's case as a USERRA discrimination claim, finding that the agency did not discriminate against the appellant under USERRA's anti-discrimination provision, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, in a benefit of employment. The appellant has not appealed that ruling, and therefore, the initial decision on that matter is final. What the majority does now is simply skirt the finality of the Administrative Judge's ruling in the USERRA case and remands in the agency's VEOA appeal for a hearing on another theory of USERRA. This novel theory is espoused not by the appellant's counsel or the appellant, but instead by the majority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly in doing so, the majority has construed 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2) in a manner inconsistent with the statute itself, decades old federal case law, USERRA's legislative history and the regulatory provisions administering the statute. Neither the federal courts which have considered it nor the Board have ever before construed USERRA in such a manner as the majority would do here. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a) states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"...a person entitled to reemployment under section 4312, upon completion of a period of service in the uniformed services, shall be promptly reemployed in a position of employment in accordance with the following order of priority: ...(2)...in the case of a person whose period of service in the uniformed services was for more than 90 days--(A) in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the continuous employment of such person with the employer had not been interrupted by such service, or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform;..."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the majority extends section 4313(a)(2)'s provisions, put in place to protect civilians from losing their <span class="Italic">own</span> positions (insofar as seniority, status and pay) while on military duty, to an affirmative agency duty to consider the absent employee for competitive promotions in and other reassignment opportunities to <span class="Italic">other</span> positions which become available during the employee's absence, irrespective of whether the employee is qualified for the position or has taken the examination for such other position or even if it is in the employee's career field. Not only is this finding incorrect as a matter of law, the burden it places on the federal employer is unworkable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_537"></span>What the majority opinion would do is to require agencies to consider absent employees serving in the military for all manners of other positions which might come open simply because the employee is deployed. But this is not the intent of the provision the majority extends. Courts have interpreted this provision, and its successor provisions, as incorporating the "escalator principle." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rogers v. City of San Antonio,</span> 392 F.3d 758, 763 (5th Cir. 2004). Under this principle, an employee returning from military duty "step[s] back on the seniority escalator [not] at the point he stepped off, [but] at the precise point he would have occupied had he kept <span class="Italic">his position</span> continuously during the war." <span class="Italic">Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corp.,</span> 328 U.S. 275, 284-85 (1946) (emphasis supplied). The legislative history is consistent with this approach. USERRA protects rights an employee has in his or her current position (the "protected individual is generally entitled to reemployment in the <span class="Italic">same</span> position which would have been attained if he or she had been continuously employed.") <span class="Italic">See</span> H. Rep. No. 103-65, at 17 (1994) <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 94 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2450. There is nothing in the quoted legislative history extending protections to jobs for which you might apply competitively if you were at the office and not deployed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the escalator principle, without actually espousing it as such, the majority extends the appellant's right to seniority-based benefits to a right to a competitive promotion in another job field. Case law does not support this analysis. Courts applying the escalator principle have held that, under some circumstances, employees who were passed over for advancement while on military duty may be entitled to retroactive advancement after returning to their civilian employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tilton v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co.,</span> 376 U.S. 169, 174-81 (1964); <span class="Italic">Goggin v. Lincoln St. Louis,</span> 702 F.2d 698, 702-04 (8th Cir. 1983). Moreover, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that a returning employee is required to show the "absolute foreseeability" of his advancement in order to establish his entitlement to it. <span class="Italic">Tilton,</span> 376 U.S. at 179-80. That Court and others, however, have drawn a distinction between "perquisites of seniority," where the advancement or other benefit was dependent on continuing employment, and situations in which the advancement or other benefit was "dependent on fitness and ability and the exercise of a discriminating managerial choice." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 179 <span class="Italic">(quoting McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas R. Co.,</span> 357 U.S. 265, 272 (1958)); <span class="Italic">see Batayola v. Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle,</span> 798 F.2d 355, 357 (9th Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Goggin,</span> 702 F.2d at 701 (one test for determining whether a benefit or promotion is a "perquisite of seniority" is whether "the nature of the benefit [is] a reward for length of service rather than a form of short-term compensation for services rendered"). Courts have also held that the benefits to be granted under the "escalator principle" must have been reasonably certain to have accrued in the employee's absence, and that a showing that advancement was based on fitness and ability was inconsistent with a finding that the "reasonable certainty" test was satisfied. <span class="Italic">E.g., Coffy v. Republic Steel Corp.,</span> 447 U.S. 191, 197 (1980); <span class="Italic">Alabama Power Co. v. Davis,</span> 431 U.S. 581, 587 (1977); <span class="Italic">Bayatola,</span> 798 F.2d at 357; <span class="Italic">Goggin,</span> 702 F.2d at 701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here it is clear that promotion to a position being filled competitively is not a "perquisite of seniority," a reward for length of service, or a benefit that would have accrued to the appellant through the mere passage of time. The position which the appellant seeks was filled competitively after the agency had considered the relative abilities of qualified candidates. Thus, this is not an instance of the appellant's right to re-employment in the same position he would have attained if he had been continuously employed (<span class="Italic">see</span> H. Rep. No. 103-65, at 17 (1994) <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 94 U.S.C.C.A.N. 249, 2450), and therefore, USERRA is neither implicated nor violated by the agency's actions here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the majority also believes that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.106(c) which provides that employing agencies must consider employees absent on military duty for promotions or other incident[s] or advantage[s] of employment to which they may have been entitled had they not been absent, provides additional support for its decision. It does not. This provision simply assures returning employees that they will not lose their right to incidents of seniority in their former position when deployed, not some other position for which they may have applied. This regulation makes sure that returning employees receive consideration for benefits based upon seniority, such as within grade increases, credit for leave accrual rate category, credit for time in the probationary status and the like. As set forth above, applying for and receiving a position not currently your own, outside your own office, as a consequence of a competitive process is not an entitlement pursuant to these regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal concerning the remedy in <span class="Italic">Grandberry,</span> the reviewing court noted in <span class="Italic">Grandberry v. D</span>HS, 406 Fed. Appx. 472, 475 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (sustaining reconstruction of the selection process rather than a direct award of the position):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The fact of USERRA violation alone does not automatically require placement in the disputed position and payment of lost wages. If it is established that it was reasonably likely that the veteran would have received the position but for the agency's error or misfeasance, then payment of lost wages and benefits would be appropriate. The burden of going forward with reconstruction is on the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At issue under USERRA in a nonpromotion case is discrimination against the veteran based on military service. If the selectee is a veteran, the appellant may have difficulty proving a case, but the appellant must be granted a hearing on the allegation. If the real claim is denial of veterans preference points, USERRA is not violated (although a claim may lie under VEOA after administrative remedies with the Labor Department have been exhausted). <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 230, 233-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (1999), explained in a challenge to the failure to secure a promotion from GS-7 to GS-9 Housing Manager:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who alleges facts sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <span class="Italic">See Dumas v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 MSPR 86, 92 (1997), the Board suggested that a claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">See also Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 145 F.3d 1480, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (noting the court's agreement with the standard the Board adopted in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this appeal, USERRA provides that "[a] person who...has performed...or has an obligation to perform...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied promotion...on the basis of that...performance of service...or obligation." 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a). Thus, in order to state a USERRA claim, the appellant must at least allege that: (1) He performed or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service; (2) he was denied promotion; and (3) the denial of promotion was "on the basis of" his military service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yates,</span> 145 F.3d at 1484; <span class="Italic">McBride v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 411, 414 (1998). Here, the appellant has alleged, and the agency does not dispute, that he was on active duty in the Army from 1980 to 1984, and again from 1996 to 1997. The appellant has also submitted evidence that, at the time of the personnel action in question, he was a member of the U.S. Army Reserve. Moreover, it is undisputed that the appellant was not selected for the GS-9 Housing Manager position, and that he was therefore denied a promotion. Thus, we find that the appellant has met the first two requirements of USERRA jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant had alleged facts, which, if proven, could establish that he was not selected for the position because of his military service, that would have been sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Yates,</span> 145 F.3d at 1484, 1485. Therefore, the AJ would have erred when he dismissed the appellant's USERRA claim without conducting a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that because it was undisputed that the individual selected for the position was also a veteran, the appellant's status as a veteran could not have been a motivating factor in the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1) (the employer is considered to have engaged in a prohibited action if service in the uniformed services is a motivating factor in the action, unless the employer can show that the action would have been taken in the absence of such service). In essence, the AJ found that the appellant had not made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction because the selectee for the position was not a similarly-situated nonveteran. Generally, that would constitute a finding on the merits, and the claim should not have been dismissed without conducting a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Melvin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 372, 377 (1998), citing <span class="Italic">Duncan,</span> 73 MSPR at 92 ("An allegation that an appellant's employer took or failed to take various actions based on his status as a veteran, in violation of the protections guaranteed under USERRA, thus would constitute a nonfrivolous allegation entitling him to Board consideration of his USERRA claim. The relative weakness of the specific factual allegations initially made by the appellant in his USERRA claim...should not serve as the basis for dismissing [his appeal] for lack of jurisdiction; if he fails to develop these allegations, his USERRA claims should simply be denied on the merits.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, however, it is clear from the wording of the appeal and supporting material, and the appellant's response to the AJ's acknowledgment order, that the appellant was only claiming that his 5-point veterans' preference was not considered in the hiring decision and that the agency hired a person without points. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not claimed that he was denied a benefit of employment on the basis of his previous performance of military duty, and therefore did not allege a claim under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears, however, that the AJ did not consider the appellant's claim that he was discriminated against because of his current and future military obligation, i.e., his status as a member of the Army Reserves. <span class="Italic">See Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 MSPR 1 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (USERRA prohibits discrimination in employment based on an employee's past, present, or future military service). For purposes of USERRA, service in the Army Reserve qualifies as "service in the uniformed services." <span class="Italic">Yates,</span> 145 F.3d at 1483 (citing 38 USC &#x00A7; 4303(13), (16)). The appellant alleged below that he was not hired because of his status "as a former <span class="Italic">and current</span> soldier," and he specifically claimed that an agency employee involved in the <span id="Page_538"></span>selection process for the GS-9 position asked him questions about his Army Reserve obligation.... There is no indication in the record that the selectee for the position had a reserve obligation. Accordingly, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was not selected for the GS-9 Housing Manager position on the basis of his obligation to perform military service. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Hamner v. DHUD</span>, 93 MSPR 84, 88-89 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) (USERRA covers the agency's failure to select the appellant for a position filled through competition); <span class="Italic">cf. Becwar v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 115 MSPR 689, 693-94 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 34 (2011) (the appellant must show that military service influenced the promotion decision; the agency meets that showing by establishing that the employee was not sufficiently qualified for the promotion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's status as a disabled veteran alone would not ordinarily support USERRA jurisdiction in a nonselection case, <span class="Italic">Carroll v. OPM,</span> CH-3443-16-0042-I-1 (NP 4/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts for the first time in his petition for review that he is a combat veteran with 20% disability. The Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). The appellant makes no such showing. Moreover, the appellant's claim does not aid him in establishing jurisdiction over his appeal. An allegation of discrimination based on a disability arising from military service is not a claim cognizable under one of the exceptions identified by the administrative judge, i.e., the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA). <span class="Italic">McBride v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 415 (1998) (explaining that USERRA proscribes the denial of initial employment based on the performance of military duty, not on the basis of a veteran's disability arising out of his performance of that duty). However, because USERRA provides an independent jurisdictional basis, the appellant may file a new appeal with the Board's regional office if he believes that the agency discriminated against him in violation of USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD,</span> CH-4324-08-0709-B-1 (NP 4/29/2011) (initially considered by the Board under a VEOA challenge, <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DOD</span>, 113 MSPR 376, 383-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2010 MSPB 47 (2010)), concluded there was no military status discrimination based as to a reconstructed personnel action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying the appellant's request for corrective action under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), the administrative judge found that he failed to prove that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's failure to select him for the position for which he had applied. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish any type of expressed or inferred hostility towards his military status, that the agency witnesses testified credibly and consistently in explaining that his name was omitted from the referral list due to administrative error, that no bias was shown on their part, and that both veterans and non-veterans were on the referral list. She further found that the appellant had offered no evidence to rebut the agency's explanation of error other than the agency wanted a short list of candidates. The appellant, however, points to testimony that the administrative judge failed to consider from Anita Lewis to the effect that her then-supervisor had directed that only the top 15 candidates ("and ties") were to be referred to the selecting official and that no non-competitive candidates were to be referred. Non-competitive candidates include 30% disabled veterans like the appellant. To the extent that the administrative judge failed to mention this testimony or consider whether it supported the appellant's claim that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's decision, any such error did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights because the agency showed that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the agency to take the same action. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014; <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1981). The Board has already found that the agency properly reconstructed the selection action. <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Department of Defense</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 376, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). The selecting official requested that the original panel members reconvene to evaluate the appellant's application; the panel did so using the same criteria used in the original evaluation of candidates; but it determined that his name would not have been included on the list of candidates referred to the selecting official because his score was too low. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; &#x00B6; 16. Moreover, we see no inherent inconsistency or other issue of credibility in Lewis's testimony that the appellant's name was not included on the original referral list due to administrative error, and her testimony, referenced above, that management had earlier directed that no non-competitive candidates were to be referred, since that direction was given in error, as the agency has acknowledged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown error in the administrative judge's refusal to consider his claim that prohibited personnel practices and violation of the merit system principles are proof of his discrimination claim. The Board's jurisdiction under USERRA is limited to considering whether the appellant has proven his claim for relief and does not extend to other claims, including prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">Bodus v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the administrative judge noted that the appellant did not stipulate to the agency's suggested reason for the elimination of the position, the agency's reason for abolishing the position is not relevant to our determination. Specifically, any right to pursue a cause of action regarding an allegation that the agency improperly abolished the billet for the position would belong to the selectee for the position, who was also a veteran, and not the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties also stipulated that the position was abolished before the selectee could enter onto duty in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The remedial provision of USERRA provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or Office to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). Under this provision, even if the Board were to make a finding that the agency discriminated or retaliated against the appellant when it failed to select him for the position, there is no effective relief that the Board could offer the appellant under the circumstances. Specifically, requiring the agency to comply with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 under the facts of this case would result in the appellant being selected for a position whose billet would have been abolished before he ever served in it. Remand File, Tab 35 at 6 (Stipulations 17 and 18). Accordingly, in terms of retroactive relief, there is no back pay or benefits available to the appellant and, in terms of prospective relief, there is no position anymore for him to encumber. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because there is no effective relief we can offer the appellant accepting all of his allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, we dismiss the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Alford</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When there was no link to military service, an agency's failure to consider employment applications that were either late or improperly filed was not a USERRA violation, <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. DOJ</span>, DE-4324-15-0507-I-1 (NP 6/23/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to show that his military status was a motivating factor in the agency's failure to accept or process his applications. The record establishes that the agency did not accept the appellant's applications because one of the applications was late, because it viewed the other application as incomplete, and because the appellant did not submit either of the applications online through <a href="http://www.USAJOBS.gov">www.USAJOBS.gov</a>, as required by the vacancy announcements. The appellant did not produce any evidence that the agency's application requirements or the filing period for applications were applied inconsistently based on military service. <span class="Italic">See Rassenfoss v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 512, &#x00B6; 8 (2014) (finding that an appellant failed to prove a USERRA discrimination claim when, among other things, he failed to show that the agency's policies at issue were applied inconsistently based on military service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to show that the agency violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) when it did not afford him additional time to file his applications. As the administrative judge correctly found, although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 provides that certain categories of individuals who are unable to file applications for open competitive examinations during a filing period due to military service are entitled to file applications after the closing date for receipt of applications, the vacancies at issue were to be filled through a merit promotion process, rather than open competitive examination or a delegated examining process, and, therefore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 does not apply here. <span class="Italic">See Grandberry v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 309, &#x00B6; 15 (2008) (finding that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312 applies to open competitive examinations and delegated examining vacancy announcements); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.312. Moreover, regardless of whether the appellant's applications were timely, the agency was not required to accept them when they were not submitted online through <a href="http://www.USAJOBS.gov">www.USAJOBS.gov</a>, as required by the vacancy announcements, and the appellant did not make advance arrangements for an alternate application procedure, as specified by the vacancy announcements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_539"></span>On review, the appellant argues that he had less time to prepare his application than other candidates because he allegedly lacked access to a computer or the internet when he was on military orders at Fort Dix, New Jersey, between January 10 and January 30, 2015. He also appears to contend that the requirement to apply online through <a href="http://www.USAJOBS.gov">www.USAJOBS.gov</a> discriminated against military members on active duty who do not have access to the internet. We find these arguments unavailing because they are claims that the agency's application requirements and filing period had a disparate impact on members of the military. The Board has held, however, that USERRA does not provide for a claim under a disparate impact theory because intent is a required element of proof to establish discrimination under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Harellson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-21 (2011). Although a known disparate impact of an agency policy or practice may be some evidence of discriminatory intent, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6; 21, the appellant in this case has not shown any such known impact on military members. In any event, the agency provided the option to submit a paper application for applicants who, unlike the appellant, requested an alternative application procedure in advance of the closing date of the vacancy announcements. Furthermore, the appellant's own failure to apply to the positions through the online application system at <a href="http://www.USAJOBS.gov">www.USAJOBS.gov</a> was not attributable to his military service because he was no longer on military orders and had returned to civilian work when he submitted both of his applications by facsimile.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not clearly explained how relative qualifications of competitors (or other factors) factor in an analysis of the influence of military service on a nonselection, <span class="Italic">Wooten v. VA</span>, 102 MSPR 131, 2006 MSPB 136 &#x00B6; 13 (2006) (nonselection):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An appellant's prohibited discrimination claim generally relates to the agency's underlying personnel action. The merits of the underlying action in the instant case, i.e., the appellant's non-selection for promotion, are not appealable to the Board; rather, USERRA only provides the Board with the authority to determine whether the appellant's military service was a motivating factor in the agency's decision. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">see Metzenbaum v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 285, &#x00B6; 15 (2001); <span class="Italic">cf. Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 540 U.S. 1218 (2004) (because the Office of Personnel Management regulation authorizing employment practices appeals granted the Board jurisdiction only with respect to particular challenges based on specific grounds, the Board, in considering the appeal, improperly invoked the provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 that gives the Board authority to consider whether any agency decision is not in accordance with law). Thus, the USERRA statute does not confer jurisdiction on the Board to address an agency's underlying personnel action where the merits of that action are not otherwise appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WEED_ALVERN_C_DE_3330_08_0490_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_434353.pdf">112 MSPR 323</a>, 325-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, 2009 MSPB 159 (2009) (considered later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-366.html#sec1-358">Manipulation of Appointments: Cancelation of Vacancy</a>," in discussion of VEOA), suggested that intentional use of a Federal Career Intern Position and limited advertising of that position, for the purpose of effectively precluding a veteran from applying for the job, or in reprisal for the prior exercise of VEOA or USERRA appeal rights by that veteran, would violate USERRA and VEOA. However, if an agency selects from one announcement, without discrimination, and the agency never reaches a second announcement that results in the appellant's application, the agency does not violate USERRA by not pursuing the selection process with the second announcement. <span class="Italic">See Mumme v. VA</span>, 356 Fed. Appx. 391 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP). If the appellant alleges reprisal because of the exercise of a USERRA appeal, the appellant must be able to show that the selecting official had knowledge of the appeal prior to the selection and acted based on that knowledge. <span class="Italic">Lodge v. EEOC</span>, 389 Fed. Appx. 993 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP).
