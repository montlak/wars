<p class="Body-Text">Employees must be notified of appeal rights involving restoration appeals; delay resulting from lack of notice is excused, <span class="Italic">Nevins v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 595, 602-03 &#x00B6; 20, 2008 MSPB 4 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As we recently discussed in <span class="Italic">Cranston v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14 (2007), timeliness is approached differently in a denial of restoration appeal than in a typical Board appeal. OPM's regulation requires an agency to notify an employee of her rights, including her <span id="Page_991"></span>appeal rights, when it denies a request for restoration upon an employee's recovery from a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 353.104. As the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), and the Board reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 607 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The critical and controlling fact in [a restoration] case is not the alleged diligence on the part of the [appellant], but the flagrant violation of the regulations by the [agency] in failing to give [the appellant] notice of [her] appeal rights in the form and manner 9 prescribed by the regulations at the time the denial [of restoration] decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 673; <span class="Italic">see Dunklebarger</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 612 ("[T]he agency's 'flagrant disregard' of the notice requirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 is still the critical fact in this case"). Further, the regulation only requires an appellant to be diligent in discovering and exercising her restoration rights, not her appeal rights from a denial of restoration, and it is "fundamentally unfair for an employee to be obligated to find out about appeal rights when the agency has failed to notify her that the denial of restoration is an appealable action." <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 612-13. As noted, the record reflects that the appellant first learned that she could appeal this matter to the Board "in 2007" when she spoke with her Congressman, and that she filed her initial appeal on March 4, 2007. Therefore, she established that she was diligent in filing her appeal after she learned that she could do so. We find, therefore, that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of this appeal because the undisputed facts show that the agency did not provide her with notice of her appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Cranston,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 14.</p>

USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 691 (1996) (permitting adjudication of an appeal filed two years after an alleged denial of military service restoration rights; the agency should have been aware of the appellant's concerns about the conditions of his return to work and resignation, and should have timely provided him with notice of Board appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Lei v. VA</span>, 71 MSPR 91, 95 (1996) (agency failed to advise the appellant of a right to appeal from a denial of a restoration right); <span class="Italic">Doyle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established good cause to waive the timeliness requirements for filing an appeal, the Board's analysis generally depends on whether the agency was required to provide notice of the appellant's right to appeal the action at issue and whether the agency provided such notice. In the absence of a duty on the agency's part to provide notice of appeal rights, an appellant must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing a right of appeal before the Board will excuse an untimely filed appeal for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 306, 313-14 (1994). However, an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to notice of appeal rights concerning a denial of restoration, section 353.104 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an agency separates, grants a leave of absence, restores or fails to restore an employee because of uniformed service or compensable injury, it shall notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating to Government employment, including any appeal and grievance rights. However, regardless of notification, an employee is still required to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, for restoration after uniformed service, or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, OPM's regulation requires an agency to notify an employee of his rights, including his appeal rights, when the agency fails to restore an employee upon his recovery from a compensable injury. In addition, the agency's action in returning the appellant to work in a modified position following his partial recovery from a compensable injury and then abolishing that position constitutes a failure to restore the appellant for which the agency was required to notify the appellant of his appeal and grievance rights.[2] <span class="Italic">See Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 73, 74-75 (1997) (discontinuing a light-duty position to which an agency has restored a partially recovered employee may constitute a denial of restoration for the purposes of Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. part 353).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We find no basis to disturb the AJ's ruling that the appellant raised nonfrivolous allegations sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over this restoration appeal. However, an agency's denial of restoration to a partially recovered employee is only potentially appealable to the Board because, in order to establish jurisdiction over the appeal, the appellant must not only allege that the agency denied him restoration, he must also nonfrivolously allege that the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 18 (2004). Board regulations require an agency to provide notice of appeal rights when it issues a decision notice on "a matter that is appealable to the Board." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. Thus, with regard to restoration appeals filed by partially recovered employees, the Board regulations arguably require an agency to provide notice of appeal rights only when the agency has reason to know that the employee believes the denial was arbitrary and capricious. However, the OPM regulation is not phrased in terms of "appealable matters"; it requires the agency to provide notice of appeal rights whenever the agency fails to restore a partially recovered employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104. Thus, we interpret the OPM regulation requiring an agency to notify a partially recovered employee to whom the agency has denied restoration of his potential right to appeal the denial to the Board, regardless of whether the employee has put the agency on notice that he considers the denial arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the instant appeal as untimely filed, the AJ, relying on <span class="Italic">Green,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 15, found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 established an exception to the general rules concerning the diligence required of an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights by requiring an appellant who was denied restoration to exercise due diligence in discovering his appeal rights, regardless of whether the agency had notified the appellant of those appeal rights as required by the regulation. Although <span class="Italic">Green</span> discussed 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 and the fact that the regulation had changed since the Federal Circuit remanded <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> to the Board in 1988, the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Green</span> was contrary to the Board's interpretation of the amended regulation in an earlier case, <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. Department of the Army,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 607 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> the Board concluded that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 only requires an appellant to be diligent in discovering and exercising his restoration rights, not his appeal rights from a denial of restoration, and it stated that it was "fundamentally unfair for an employee to be obligated to find out about appeal rights when the agency has failed to notify him that the denial of restoration is an appealable action." <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 set forth in <span class="Italic">Green,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 15, conflicts with the Board's prior interpretation of that regulation as set forth in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span> contains the correct interpretation of this regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 set forth in <span class="Italic">Green</span> is not supported by the Federal Register notice through which OPM promulgated the amendment to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 that requires employees to exercise due diligence to ascertain and exercise their rights. This notice did not indicate that OPM intended the due diligence requirement to apply to an employee's discovery and exercise of his appeal rights. Restoration to Duty from Military Service or Compensable Injury, 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (Jan. 14, 1988). In addition, the interpretation of the regulation set forth in <span class="Italic">Green</span> is arguably inconsistent with the Board's authority to prescribe regulations governing its own procedures and with its broad discretion to waive its timeliness requirement for good cause shown. As set forth above, the time limit for filing an appeal, including a restoration appeal, is governed by the Board's regulations, and the discretion to decide whether to waive these regulations for good cause shown rests with the Board, not OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (the Board has the authority to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary for the performance of its functions; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12 (the Board may revoke, amend, or waive any of its regulations); <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("We have often stated that whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should <span id="Page_992"></span>be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion."). Despite the fact that the discretion to waive the regulatory time limit for filing an appeal rests with the Board, <span class="Italic">Green</span> essentially concluded that the OPM regulation imposed limitations on this discretion by requiring the Board to account for the appellant's diligence in discovering his appeal rights when considering whether the circumstances might constitute good cause for an untimely filing. Because OPM did not indicate that this was its intent when it promulgated the diligence requirement upon amending 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 in 1988, we reaffirm the Board's conclusion in Dunklebarger that the regulation's due diligence requirement does not relate to "appeal rights," but is instead "oriented toward alerting employees that they are obligated to find out and pursue their rights concerning <span class="Italic">the requirements for restoration of duty</span>." <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. at 612. Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Green</span> to the extent that it suggests that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104 requires an employee to exercise diligence in discovering his appeal rights upon a denial of restoration following partial recovery from a compensable injury.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Nevertheless, <span class="Italic">Green</span> is distinguishable from the instant appeal because the appellant therein had an extensive history of litigation before the Board, including a prior restoration appeal, and, therefore, regardless of whether the agency notified him of his appeal rights, he could not credibly contend that he was unaware of the requirement to timely file his restoration appeal or to demonstrate good cause for his delay. <span class="Italic">Green</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 16. The Board's records do not reflect that the instant appellant, who filed his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, had any such prior experience with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation requires the agency to give an employee notice of his appeal rights when, among other things, it restores or fails to restore an employee after a compensable injury. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.104. Therefore, as the Federal Circuit asserted in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> and the Board reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical and controlling fact in [a restoration] case is not the alleged diligence on the part of the [appellant], but the flagrant violation of the regulations by the [agency] in failing to give [the appellant] notice of [his] appeal rights in the form and manner prescribed by the regulations at the time the denial [of restoration] decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett,</span> 839 F.2d at 673; <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 612 ("[T]he agency's 'flagrant disregard' of the notice requirement under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 is still the critical fact in this case"). The record in this appeal reflects that the appellant first learned that he could appeal the agency's denial of restoration from the agency's April 18, 2006 final interview letter on his EEO complaint and that he filed his initial appeal two weeks later on May 2, 2006. Therefore, the appellant established that he was diligent in filing his appeal after he learned that he could do so. Because the agency failed to provide the appellant required notice of his appeal rights, we find that the appellant has established good cause for the untimely filing of his restoration appeal regarding the denial of restoration that resulted from the abolishment of his modified position. <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 588 (an appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 114 MSPR 386, 392 &#x00B6; 17, 2010 MSPB 135 (2010) (analysis similar to <span class="Italic">Nevins</span> and <span class="Italic">Cranston</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal from an agency's failure to provide restoration rights may depend on the appellant's timely restoration request. If the agency fails to give the appellant a required notice that provides information concerning the exercise of restoration rights, the appellant's otherwise untimely appeal may be excused, even if the appellant failed to meet the regulatory time limits for both requesting restoration and appealing to the Board, <span class="Italic">Ward v. VA</span>, 67 MSPR 425, 429-31 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge rejected the appellant's reliance on <span class="Italic">Hetrick v. Department of the Interior</span>, 39 MSPR 426 (1989), and found that she did not have the authority to waive the statutory time limit despite the appellant's due diligence or the agency's failure to notify him of his restoration rights. Because she found that <span class="Italic">Hetrick</span> addressed the timeliness of a petition for appeal rather than the timeliness of a restoration request, the administrative judge refused to apply it here. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's account, <span class="Italic">Hetrick</span>, in fact, addressed the timeliness of restoration requests. In that case, the Board held that where an agency fails to provide an employee with notice of restoration rights, good cause has been established to excuse the late filing of a request for restoration regardless of the employee's due diligence<span class="Italic">. See Hetrick</span>, 39 MSPR at 429-30. Although the employee in <span class="Italic">Hetrick</span> sought restoration following recovery from a compensable injury, we find it instructive here because both types of restoration are governed by the notice requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986).[3] This subsection expressly requires an agency to provide notice of restoration rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall notify an employee who is separated, furloughed, or given leave of absence because of military duty or injury, of his rights, obligations, and benefits relating to his Government employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986). Accordingly, we find that an agency's failure to notify an employee who left for military service prior to February 16, 1988, of restoration rights following such military service excuses the untimeliness of a request for restoration regardless of the employee's due diligence<span class="Italic">. See Hetrick</span>, 39 MSPR at 429-30; <span class="Italic">see also Speker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 MSPR 380, 385 (1990) (an agency's failure to provide notice of election rights and corresponding deadlines may warrant a waiver of a filing deadline, if such notice is required by statute or regulation), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 MSPR 602 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the agency and the administrative judge relied on the wrong regulation in their analysis of the appellant's due diligence. Because the appellant left the agency for military service in 1986, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986), not 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104 (1994), governed the agency's notification of restoration rights<span class="Italic">. See Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 43 MSPR 558, 562-63 (1990) (the regulations in effect at the time when an action commences--or when it is proposed--are the regulations that are generally applicable). Effective February 16, 1988, subsection 353.106 was amended to include the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">However, regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment within the time limits provided by Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code, for reemployment after military service or as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104 (1988); 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (1988). Subsection 353.106 (1986) contained no such provision regarding an appellant's due diligence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the evidence of record shows that the agency failed to provide the appellant with the notice required by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106. It is well settled that a general statement by an agency that an employee has an appeal right to the Board, but which does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal, does not meet the requirements of the notice of appeal rights, and, therefore, is insufficient as such notice<span class="Italic">. See Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Similarly, these form and manner requirements govern an agency's notice of restoration rights under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986)<span class="Italic">. See Hetrick</span>, 39 MSPR at 429-30. We find, therefore, that the agency was required to inform the appellant, pursuant to subsection 353.106, of at least the time limit for filing a request for restoration and information on where and how to file such a request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only notice relating to restoration rights provided by the agency before 1993 was a memorandum in the appellant's possession before his departure in 1986 which stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There are many benefits and rights which Mr. Ward is entitled due to his entry into military service and it is imperative that he be counseled by an Employee Relations Specialist. Please arrange an appointment for Mr. Ward by calling this office....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency did not counsel the appellant of his restoration rights prior to his departure for military service. Indeed, the agency was unable to find any evidence that such counseling occurred. Therefore, we must determine whether the requirements of subsection 353.106 were satisfied by proper notice of restoration rights in the memorandum itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The memorandum does not set out notice of the time limits for requesting restoration, nor information on where and how to file such a request or how to compute the time within which a request must be filed. We thus conclude that the memorandum does not meet the requirements of the notice of restoration rights the agency was required to give the appellant, and, therefore, it is insufficient as such notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency committed harmful procedural error when it failed to give the appellant notice of his restoration rights and that the agency's failure thus constituted good cause for the appellant's late filing of his restoration request<span class="Italic">. See Hetrick</span>, 39 MSPR 429-30; <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 674.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 607, 610-13 (1995), rejected the argument that the appellant should have known when to appeal the denial of restoration rights because an earlier removal notice provided a statement of appeal rights as to the removal. The agency was required to provide notice to the appellant of appeal rights when it denied him restoration; when it failed to do so, the ensuing appeal could not be dismissed as untimely:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, a case whose facts are remarkably similar to those in this case, the Federal Circuit held that the failure of the agency to give notice to the appellant of her appeal rights constituted good cause for the late filing of her appeal. <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 674. The court added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_993"></span>The critical and controlling fact in this case is not the alleged lack of diligence on the part of the petitioner, but the flagrant violation of the regulations by the respondent in failing to give petitioner notice of her appeal rights in the form and manner prescribed by the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the administrative judge erred, for several reasons, in finding the agency's failure to give notice of the appellant's appeal rights to be "only one factor to be considered." The new language in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104 as to "due diligence," referenced below, does not divest agencies of the fundamental obligation to notify appellants of their appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the appellant's assertion that the effective date of the denial of restoration was August 27, 1992 (the date of the removal notice), the administrative judge found that the appeal was filed approximately one year late. In the course of his analysis, he conceded that the agency had not notified the appellant of his right of appeal to the Board concerning his restoration to duty. The administrative judge also acknowledged that in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 673, the court found that the "critical and controlling" factor in reviewing a timeliness issue is whether the appellant received notice of appeal rights. Nevertheless, he found that factor had been tempered by a requirement in one of the applicable regulations, as revised post-<span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, that "regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104 (revised version of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308(a)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> was construing two regulations: 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308(a), entitled "notice of right of appeal," relating specifically to restoration to duty claims,[8] and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21, a Board regulation setting forth the contents of the notice required when an agency takes any appealable action. In the case at hand, we also must construe two regulations: the amended 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308(a), which now appears as 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104,[9] and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21 (unchanged).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308(a) (1985) (Notice of right to appeal) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;When an agency refuses to restore, or determines that it is not feasible to restore an employee under the provisions of law and this part, it shall notify the employee in writing of the reasons for its decision and of his or her right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations. The agency shall comply with the provisions of &#x00A7; 1201.21 of this title and shall forward a copy of the notice to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104 (1994) (Notification of rights and obligations) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">When an agency separates, places on leave of absence, restores or fails to restore an employee because of military duty or compensable injury, it shall notify the employee of his or her rights, obligations, and benefits relating to Government employment, including any appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) as required by &#x00A7; 1201.21 of this title, or where appropriate, the right to grieve under a negotiated grievance procedure. However, regardless of notification, an employee is still obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, and to seek reemployment...as soon as he or she is able after a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the underlying obligation in restoration to duty cases[10] was and remains that the agency must give notice to the employee of appeal rights to the Board when it decides a matter appealable to the Board. This requirement is codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21, and has not been amended. The court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> rested on both 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308 <span class="Italic">and</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21. Thus, the agency's "flagrant disregard" of the notice requirement under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21 is still the critical fact in this case. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Pursuant to both 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.308(a) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the impact of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.104, we find that the administrative judge's interpretation of that language ("an employee is <span class="Italic">still</span> obligated to exercise due diligence in ascertaining his...rights") is unpersuasive. Such language does not dilute the agency's underlying obligation to notify the employee of pertinent appeal rights, to which the regulation still refers. It is noteworthy that the amended regulation at issue in this case does not refer to "appeal rights." Instead, the amended language is oriented toward alerting employees that they are obligated to find out and pursue their rights <span class="Italic">concerning the requirements for restoration to duty</span>. OPM's explanation supports this position: The amendment was added to notify the employee that he or she clearly "has an obligation to use due diligence in ascertaining his or her rights, <span class="Italic">and to return to duty as soon as he or she is able</span>." 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (1988) (emphasis added)<span class="Italic">. See also Ward v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, MSPB Docket No. BN-0353-94-0033-B-1 (Apr. 11, 1995) (restates agency's obligation to notify employees of restoration rights). Although <span class="Italic">Ward</span> involves restoration following military service, it reiterates the agency obligation to notify employees of restoration rights under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.106 (1986), which covers restoration from compensable injury as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In regard to the agency's generalized argument that the untimely filing should not be excused because the appellant did not exercise due diligence, we reiterate the teaching of <span class="Italic">Shiflett:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It appears...that the respondent requires strict compliance with the regulations by the petitioner, while at the same time it violates the regulations with impunity. We cannot approve such a one-sided application of the law to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 673.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is, we find, fundamentally unfair for an employee to be obligated to find out about appeal rights when the agency has failed to notify him that the denial of restoration is an appealable action.[12] We find no indication in the new regulation that OPM intended to encourage such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;We note that even after the change in the regulation pertaining to notice of appeal rights occurred, the Federal Circuit held that <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> is applicable when the employee's right to appeal is clear and well known to the agency as of the time it first acted and there is a regulation facially applicable to the employee's case expressly requiring the agency to give him or her notice of a right to appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164, 1168 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The agency here knew or should have known that its denial of restoration is an appealable action, and that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21 expressly requires the agency to give notice of appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the argument that the agency's notification of appeal rights in <span class="Italic">the removal</span> <span class="Italic">action</span> gave the appellant adequate notice of his right to appeal a restoration action, we reject such a view, and in so doing rely squarely on <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>. In <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, the court forthrightly rejected the agency's contention that a statement in a grievance proceeding decision as to "5 CFR 353 via the MSPB [being] the appropriate means of appeal" was adequate notice to the petitioner of her right of appeal to the Board as to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d at 673-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court found that the statement in the grievance matter noting jurisdiction over restoration issues in the Board did not constitute notice to the appellant of a right to appeal there, since it provided none of the information as to the pertinent time limits, filing address, etc. required under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We therefore find that the notice of appeal rights attached to the notice of removal letter in this matter did not constitute notice of appeal rights in the appellant's restoration case. That was given in a removal proceeding, not a restoration proceeding; it did not even mention the restoration to duty issue; and it did not supply any of the information required under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of his restoration to duty appeal, and we therefore waive the timeliness requirement in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 110 MSPR 97, 105-06 &#x00B6; 18, 2008 MSPB 221 (2008) (complex facts and procedural history with a result similar to <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span>: if the agency should have notified the appellant of appeal rights relative to a potential restoration claim, delay in filing the appeal was excused; knowledge of the appeal right was not to be imputed from a removal case involving its own notice of appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of the 1995 <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger</span> decision, the Board determined that even if an agency fails to provide notice of the right to appeal denial of restoration rights, the employee must still be reasonably diligent in his pursuit of the appeal. Under <span class="Italic">Besemer v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 260, 265 (1998), involving a delay of several years in filing an appeal when the appellant had knowledge of appeal rights from his own prior restoration appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly asserted below that the agency did not give him notice of a Board appeal right when it issued its July 26, 1993 decision. When an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with notice of his right to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21; <span class="Italic">Jones v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 309 (1994). As a general matter, an agency's failure to notify an employee of his or her Board appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will justify a waiver of the filing deadline<span class="Italic">. Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 583, 587 (1995). Nevertheless, an appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, must show that he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned that he could do so. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 588.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that he was diligent in filing an appeal after learning that he could so. Although the appellant contended that he recently discovered agency misconduct that prompted him to file this appeal, he did not allege that he recently discovered his right to appeal the agency's action denying him restoration in July 1993, nor did he explain when he learned of his right to appeal that denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gingrich,</span> 67 MSPR at 588 (finding the appellant diligent in filing an appeal after discovering his right to do so where it was undisputed that the appellant filed his appeal less than one month after he found out that individuals who retired during the agency's nationwide restructuring may <span id="Page_994"></span>be able to contest their retirements). Moreover, by virtue of his February 15, 1994 Board appeal of the agency's action denying him restoration in New York, the appellant, who was represented by an attorney in that action, should have known of his right to appeal the denial of restoration in Florida.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miyashiro v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 628, 631 (1998) (restoration appeal was untimely after the Board attributed notice of Board deadlines to the appellant based on appellant's involvement in a prior restoration appeal prosecuted by a union representative).
