<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-285"><span class="space">c.</span> Safe Harbor Provision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board sustained the drug-related removal of an aircraft mechanic in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 79, 82-84 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3486), providing insight into the "safe harbor" provisions of the Executive Order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's November 21, 1991 general policy statement on drug usage as well as its letter, received by the appellant on July 25, 1990, regarding its specific testing policy for his position are consistent with Executive Order No. 12564. The Order requires initiation of disciplinary action, including removal if appropriate, where an employee has been identified as a user of illegal drugs, provided that he has not voluntarily identified himself or volunteered for testing prior to identification by other means. Exec. Order No. 12564 &#x00A7; 5(b)(1) and &#x00A7; 5(g). We specifically note that the Order does not limit an agency's authority to remove an employee based on a first offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's role is not to insist that the agency strike a balance of relevant factors where the Board would have chosen to strike it....&#8197;The administrative judge has minimized the agency's concern regarding the possible consequences of the appellant's drug usage on his work. We believe that the agency's action, while strict, was not out of line in view of the appellant's position of journeyman Aircraft Mechanic, where the consequences of a mistake could result in loss of not just a C-130 aircraft but of the crew as well. <span class="Italic">Cf. Bolling v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 668, 673 (1990) (90-day suspension was maximum penalty where agency did not show that defective work as a welder could result in breakdown of vital systems). Furthermore, as noted by the administrative judge, the agency employed journeymen because it did not have the ability in all cases to check, or to have someone else certify, an employee's work. We find that the nature of the appellant's work renders the sustained misconduct even more serious since work performed on the aircraft while under the influence of drugs could result in an accident with the potential loss of life and property. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 572, 576 (1990). The serious risk to the safety of those dependent upon the proper maintenance of an aircraft obviates the mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">See Schulmeister v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 13, 16 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 411 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the administrative judge found that the agency considered the relevant mitigating factors, and since the appellant was on notice that removal was a possible consequence of illegal drug usage, even for the first use,[4] we find that the agency's selection of the removal penalty was a proper exercise of managerial judgment and did not exceed the limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rice v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 998 F.2d 997, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the law is well-settled that an employee can be removed for off-duty possession and use of illegal drugs, in this case, marijuana and cocaine).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In its July 25, 1990 letter to the appellant, the agency notified him that mandatory requirements for his continued employment in the testing designated position were that he "(a) refrain from the use of illegal drugs and (b) if requested, submit to urinalysis testing." Since the appellant did not self-identify or take any steps to quit until he was caught, despite this warning and its offer of "safe-harbor" provisions during which he would not be subject to disciplinary action for past use, we find reasonable the agency's concern regarding his continued employment. In addition, the affidavit of the forensic toxicologist indicates that the results of the appellant's urine test were consistent with recreational drug use of 2-3 times a week. The appellant, even though he admitted to past drug use during a March 26, 1993 deposition (after he <span id="Page_2828"></span>was discharged from the inpatient rehabilitation program) still denied frequent drug usage; his denial appears consistent with the psychiatric admission interview for the rehabilitation program which he entered in December 1992, as well as with his denial of any use immediately following the drug test. Under the circumstances, both the appellant's apparent long-term usage and continued denial could make the agency reasonably suspicious of his rehabilitation prospects and his trustworthiness on the job.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order 12564, "Drug-Free Federal Workplace," issued in 1986, states that: (1) federal employees are required to refrain from the use of illegal drugs; (2) the use of illegal drugs by federal employees is "contrary to the efficiency of the service[;] " and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for federal employment. Agencies are required to develop plans for achieving the objective of a drug-free workplace. These plans must set forth the agency's expectations regarding drug use and actions to be anticipated in response to identified drug use, and must include employee assistance programs that emphasize referral to rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Executive Order makes distinctions between employees who are found to use illegal drugs and employees who voluntarily identify themselves as users of illegal drugs. Section 5(a) of the Executive Order requires agencies to refer employees who are found to use illegal drugs to an Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling, and referral for treatment or rehabilitation as appropriate. Section 5(b) states that agencies <span class="Italic">shall</span> initiate action to discipline employees who are found to use illegal drugs, except that discipline is not required for employees who voluntarily identify themselves as illegal drug users prior to being identified through other means and who meet other conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 5(c) and (d) state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;Agencies shall not allow any employee to remain on duty in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs, prior to successful completion of rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program. However, as part of a rehabilitation or counseling program, the head of an Executive agency may, in his or her discretion, allow an employee to return to duty in a sensitive position if it is determined that this action would not pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;Agencies shall initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs and:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Refuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Does not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims immunity from disciplinary action under Executive Order 12564 of September 15, 1986, entitled "Drug-Free Federal Workplace." The pertinent section of Executive Order 12564 provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Agencies shall initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs, <span class="Italic">provided that</span> such action is not required for an employee who: [<span class="Italic">inter alia</span>] (1) Voluntarily identifies himself as a user of illegal drugs or who volunteers for drug testing pursuant to section 3(b) of this Order, <span class="Italic">prior to being identified through other means</span>. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is not covered by this provision, however, because his coworkers implicated him for drug-related offenses three days before he "voluntarily" identified himself to the agency as a drug user. Thus, the appellant did not meet the requirement under Section 5(b)(1) of Executive Order 12564 that he identify himself "prior to being identified through other means."</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lazenby v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 514, 516-19 (1995), analyzed the relation of Executive Order 12564 and <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation factors as to an employee removed after voluntary entry into rehabilitation and drug use during rehabilitation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the latter part of 1993, the appellant, then a WG-7 Painting Worker, informed her supervisor that she was "having problems coming to work on time" because of a "substance abuse problem...primarily with cocaine." Her supervisor told her that she should call Mr. James Ford, Chief of the agency's employee assistance program (EAP), and try to enter an inpatient rehabilitation program. The appellant completed a 2-week inpatient drug rehabilitation program in October 1993, for cocaine and marijuana dependency, and was discharged for outpatient follow-up. The appellant had previously undergone rehabilitation programs for cocaine addiction, in 1987 and in 1990, one of which was upon referral from the agency's EAP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 10, 1993, the agency notified her as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You voluntarily admitted yourself to inpatient treatment for a substance abuse problem. As a result of information received regarding your use of illegal drugs, you are hereby given a "firm choice." You must complete all phases of the rehabilitation process you have started and remain free of any illegal drugs, or you will face removal from Air Force employment....&#8197;You will be subject to unannounced drug tests for one year from the date you receive this letter. Any refusal to submit to a drug test or any positive test result during this one-year period will result in a proposal to remove you from employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On a random drug test on December 1, 1993, the appellant tested positive for cocaine use, and admitted having used cocaine twice since her discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective February 28, 1994, the agency removed the appellant from her position for cocaine use. She timely filed this appeal and requested a telephonic hearing. After holding the requested hearing, the administrative judge (AJ) found, based on the appellant's stipulations, that the agency proved the charge of cocaine use and the nexus between the charge and the efficiency of the service; he further found, however, that the penalty of removal clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness, and mitigated it to a 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below and on petition for review that the penalty of removal under the circumstances was reasonable and consistent with Executive Order No. 12564 (Sept. 15, 1986), entitled "Drug-Free Federal Workplace."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order No. 12564, in pertinent part, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sec.&#x2003;5. Personnel Actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Agencies shall initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs, provided that such action is not required for an employee who:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Voluntarily identifies himself as a user of illegal drugs or who volunteers for drug testing pursuant to section 3(b) of this Order, prior to being identified through other means;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Obtains counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;Agencies shall initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs and:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Refuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Does not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">51 Fed. Reg. 32,889 (1986), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 5 USC 7301 n.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Executive Order states that an agency must initiate a disciplinary action, though not necessarily a removal action, against an employee who is found to use drugs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hougens v. United States Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 148 (1988), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 141 (1993). The initiation of disciplinary action is "not required" if the finding of drug use is based on the employee's self-identification, but only if the employee also obtains EAP-sponsored counseling/rehabilitation and "[t]hereafter" refrains from using illegal drugs. If any employee who is found to use illegal drugs (either through self-identification or other identification) refuses to obtain EAP-sponsored counselling/rehabilitation or "thereafter" uses illegal drugs, the Executive Order states that the agency must initiate a removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting this section of the Executive Order, the AJ interpreted the term "thereafter" to refer "to the period <span class="Italic">after</span> counseling or rehabilitation...is complete," rather than to the period beginning immediately after a finding of drug use. Thus, the AJ interpreted the Executive Order as "direct[ing]" a removal action "only...where an employee does not refrain from the use of illegal drugs after such counseling or rehabilitation is complete," and not where the employee "relapses shortly after she self-referred for the treatment of cocaine addiction, when the relapse <span id="Page_2829"></span>is reasonable and fairly contemplated by the very nature of the rehabilitation itself."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ recognized, the meaning of the term "thereafter" is somewhat ambiguous based on the structure of section 5. Contrary to the AJ's interpretation of the term, however, we agree with the agency's argument on petition for review that the term should be interpreted as including the period immediately after a finding of drug use. The Executive Order reflects the policy that the use of illegal drugs by Federal employees will not be tolerated and that, although an employee who uses illegal drugs will be offered rehabilitative assistance, she herself will be primarily responsible for changing her behavior.[2] The AJ's interpretation of the term "thereafter" is inconsistent with the firm stance against the use of illegal drugs expressed in the Executive Order because it would permit employees to continue using illegal drugs while undergoing counseling or rehabilitation, without facing discipline. Moreover, such an interpretation would hamper drug rehabilitation efforts by ignoring the "medically recognized principle that one of the ways to help...drug abusers overcome their problem is to make them take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions." <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 148. In fact, the Board has held that removal of employees for use of illegal drugs while undergoing drug rehabilitation was "consistent with Executive Order No. 12564." <span class="Italic">Burrell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 58 MSPR 372, 374-75 (1993); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 69, 72-73 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Executive Order No. 12564 states, in part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) The Federal government should have a "program designed to offer drug users a helping hand and, at the same time, demonstrat[e] to drug users and potential drug users that drugs will not be tolerated in the Federal workplace"; (2) the "use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees is inconsistent not only with the law-abiding behavior expected of all citizens, but also with the special trust placed in such employees as servants of the public"; (3) "Federal employees who use illegal drugs must themselves be primarily responsible for changing their behavior and, if necessary, begin the process of rehabilitating themselves"; and (4) "[p]ersons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for Federal employment." 5 USC 7301 n.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find, based on the Executive Order, that the appellant's offense of using illegal drugs while undergoing rehabilitation was sufficiently serious under the circumstances to warrant the initiation of removal procedures. The AJ stated in this regard that, "because of the powerfully addictive nature of cocaine" and because "the appellant's relapse occurred just a month into her rehabilitation," the relapse was "reasonable and fairly contemplated by the very nature of the rehabilitation itself." He thus appeared to find that the seriousness of the offense was lessened by the particularly addictive nature of cocaine and the point in time during rehabilitation at which the relapse occurred. However, there is nothing in the Executive Order suggesting that these factors are relevant in determining the seriousness of the offense. Rather, the Executive Order implicitly recognizes that the use of illegal drugs of whatever kind is generally a difficult habit to overcome, thus requiring professional rehabilitative treatment and involving the potential for relapses; despite this recognition, and undoubtedly because of it, the Executive Order expresses the policy that illegal drug use will be firmly dealt with and that it is the employee's burden to refrain from using illegal drugs and otherwise satisfactorily complete rehabilitation if offered.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an agency have its own policy of placing removal proposals in abeyance pending the outcome of rehabilitation programs, the agency may proceed to a removal decision, without reissuing a proposal, should the employee fail successfully to complete the rehabilitation program. However, should the employer's determination that the employee failed rehabilitation be based on information received from a third-party, e.g., a rehabilitation center, the employee may challenge the basis relied on by that provider for determining that the employee failed to complete rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v.
