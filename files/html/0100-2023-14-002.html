<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Parsons v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 707 F.2d 1406 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (following remand, 21 MSPR 438 (1984)), the employee was fired for AWOL and submission of a false sick leave request. The court determined that in an agency removal action based on misconduct, the agency must make three determinations: (1) the employee actually committed the alleged misconduct; (2) there is a sufficient nexus between the misconduct and the efficiency of the service to sustain the adverse action; and (3) the penalty imposed has been appropriately chosen for the specific misconduct involved. The agency has the burden of persuasion concerning these three elements of its decision and it is therefore obligated to present evidence to the Board necessary to support each element. The view that nexus must be established in each adverse action case, including those involving inadequate performance, was echoed in <span class="Italic">Hatcher v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 705 F.2d 1309 (11th Cir. 1983). Judicial opinions establish that there must be a rational connection between the dismissal of an employee and the statutory standard of promoting "the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hoska v. Dept. of Army</span>, 677 F.2d 131 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Nexus need not be specifically alleged in a proposal letter; it may be inferred from the facts or charges described in the proposal. <span class="Italic">See Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523 (Fed. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Misconduct cases arise from conduct on or off the job. "The Board has long recognized that an employee's misconduct outside business hours, or even on leave, is punishable if it involves acts directly related to the employee's duties and responsibilities, or the employment relationship itself. <span class="Italic">See SSA v. Manion</span>, 19 MSPR 298, 315-16 (1984) (an employee is answerable for misconduct related to his employment, even if on leave or after work hours)." <span class="Italic">Chandler v. SSA</span>, 80 MSPR 542, 547 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). Although <span class="Italic">Chandler</span> and other cases address off-duty conduct, the nexus formulation applies to all misconduct: there must be a connection to any misconduct, disciplinary action, and service efficiency. <span class="Italic">Risner v. FAA</span>, 7 MSPR 480, 486, 7 MSPB 342 (1981), involving insubordination and misconduct on the agency premises, noted that the Board was required to determine "nexus," expansively described as the relation between the grounds for an adverse action and the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties or some other legitimate governmental interest promoting the efficiency of the service. The Board also states that "[t]here is sufficient nexus between an employee's conduct and the efficiency of the service where the conduct occurred in part at work." <span class="Italic">Weaver v. SSA</span>, 94 MSPR 447, 454 &#x00B6; 20 (2003) (reviewing an arbitration award sustaining adverse action against an appellant who improperly accessed Social Security records); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Greene v. OPM,</span> NY-0752-11-0043-I-1 (NP 1/31/2012) ("There is sufficient nexus between an employee's conduct and the efficiency of the service where the conduct occurred in part at work. <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A clear and direct relationship must exist between the articulated grounds for an adverse personnel action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate governmental interest. <span class="Italic">Steve v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 14 MSPR 491, 492 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Owens v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 8 MSPR 580, 583 (1981)). In cases involving off-duty conduct, under <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 282, 287 (1989), there are three general ways of establishing nexus between an agency's action and an employee's off-duty conduct: "(1) A rebuttable presumption of nexus may arise in certain egregious circumstances; (2) the agency may show, by a preponderance of evidence, that the misconduct at issue has adversely affected the employee's or coworkers' job performance or the agency trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; and (3) it may show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission." <span class="Italic">See Beasley v. DOD</span>, 52 MSPR 272, 274 (1992) (restating the three tests); <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 364, 366 (1991) (reciting the three means of proof; the off-duty sexual abuse of a minor raised a rebuttable presumption of nexus). If there is a medical condition that purportedly makes it impossible for an employee to perform a job, the agency must establish a nexus between the medical condition and observed deficiencies in work performance or employee conduct, or a high probability of hazard if the condition could result in injury to the employee or others because of the kind of work performed by the employee.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts that his off-duty conduct had no bearing on his employment. However, one way of establishing a nexus linking an employee's off-duty misconduct with the efficiency of the service is to show by preponderant evidence that the misconduct affects management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance. <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1987). We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency established a nexus for the conduct unbecoming charge because the appellant's actions caused management to lose faith in his ability to provide a measured response to stressful situations as he completed his central duties of ensuring security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Department of Labor</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 491, 494 (1984) (finding that the appellant's off-duty arrest for first degree assault and public drunkenness bore a nexus to the efficiency of the service given the sensitive and trustworthy nature of his duties), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 181 (Fed.

In this regard, the administrative judge noted the deciding official's testimony that the appellant's central duties involved ensuring that the installation maintains adequate physical security and that the appellant was expected to obtain a weapon from the agency's armory and repel any attack of the installation. The administrative judge further noted the deciding official's testimony that the appellant's misconduct with his son caused him to question the appellant's "composure" and his ability to control his emotions in connection with his responsibility for protecting people.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency trust of a manager influenced a termination for disparaging comments by the appellant, a manager, about other agency personnel, including other managers, conveyed to agency personnel through cellphone texts or messages during off-duty hours and away from the agency worksite, with a resultant complaint of a hostile environment, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2075.OPINION.8-6-2020_1632021.pdf">824 Fed. Appx.</a> 1028 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jenkins was employed by the Agency for nearly 30 years until her removal in March 2018. During her final year of employment, she served as the Chief of Staff to the FAA's Associate Administrator for Human Resources.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2017, one of Jenkins's subordinates, Sharon Bartley, complained to the FAA Accountability Board that Jenkins had created a hostile work environment. In support of her complaint, Bartley provided the Accountability Board with a number of personal cell phone text message exchanges that she had with Jenkins. Many of the text messages were disparaging toward Jenkins's colleagues, including senior officials at the FAA. Moreover, many of the messages contained derogatory comments about the race and gender of Jenkins's colleagues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency requested an investigation into Bartley's allegations from the Office of Security and Hazardous Materials Safety ("ASH"). During that investigation, ASH Agent Richard Busser interviewed Jenkins and asked her about text messages she had sent to Bartley, and Jenkins subsequently provided a signed statement about the interview. The Agency also forensically searched Bartley's phone and exported text messages sent by Jenkins into a hard drive. Additionally, during the investigation, another FAA employee, Lavada Strickland, came forward with copies of text messages from Jenkins that were similar in nature to the messages obtained from Bartley's phone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon concluding its investigation, the Agency prepared a Report of Investigation, which included a compilation of disparaging text messages sent by Jenkins. On December 6, 2017, the Agency proposed to remove Jenkins from her position as Chief of Staff. The Notice of Proposed Removal provided three reasons: (1) inappropriate conduct; (2) making disparaging remarks racial in nature; and (3) lack of candor. In support of the charge for inappropriate conduct, the Agency provided 18 specifications, each one citing a separate text message that negatively referenced one or more of Jenkins's colleagues at the FAA. In support of the charge for making disparaging remarks racial in nature, the Agency provided 22 specifications, each one citing a separate text message in which Jenkins made a racial comment about a colleague. In support of the charge for lack of candor, the Agency provided four specifications, three citing Jenkins's statement that it was "a lie" that she constantly told Bartley that there are a lot of dumb people working in HR, and the fourth citing Jenkins's statement: "I do not admit to the validity of these messages....They are allegedly from [a] phone identified as 'Cara' with no phone number....I am not saying I did not send them but that I simply do not remember sending some of them."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain the charge of misconduct, the agency must have established by preponderant evidence the existence of a nexus between the employee's misconduct and the work of the agency, i.e., the agency's performance of its functions. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 565 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2000)). "As long as the agency can prove that the removal of [the employee] promoted the efficiency of the service, however, nothing prevents the agency from relying upon off-duty behavior." <span class="Italic">Weekes v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 351 F. App'x 442, 445 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 229 F.3d at 1361; <span class="Italic">Allred v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 786 F.2d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Here, the misconduct at issue consists of Jenkins' prolonged history of repeatedly making disparaging and racial comments about FAA leadership to other FAA employees, including one of her subordinates. Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that such misconduct was related to Jenkins's job responsibilities and was detrimental to the Agency's performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Jenkins's misconduct negatively affected the job performances and <span id="Page_2283"></span>work environments of Bartley and Strickland, who were the recipients of the offending messages. For example, in a statement provided to Agent Busser, Bartley described the toxic environment and the effects of Jenkins's behavior on Bartley's health and job performance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have put up with [Jenkins's] abusive behavior for many months now and the only reason I filed a complaint with the Accountability Board on July 24, 2017, was because [Jenkins] has created such a hostile work environment it has greatly affected my health. AHR has now become like a gossip show instead of a workplace of professionals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">J.A. 270; <span class="Italic">see also</span> J.A. 275 ("[Jenkins] is the main pivot point for the toxic environment I, and others, are subjected to."); J.A. 277("[Jenkins] also created the hostile work environment that has now affected my health so much I am faced with quitting the FAA if I cannot transfer to another position in the agency."); J.A. 278 ("Working in that environment has changed me [sic] my health, I can't sleep...my health has been so affected by what I've endure[d] these past few months."). Additionally, according to Agent Busser's Record of Interview with Strickland, she "felt like quitting her AHR detail because of all the stress....It was the stress of all the drama and negativity caused by, and perpetuated by, [Jenkins]." Strickland also noted that "[Jenkins's] behavior created so much tension and mistrust in AHR that many employees want to transfer out of AHR."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to directly affecting Bartley and Strickland, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Jenkins's messages undermined the authority and credibility of senior officials at the FAA, a point that was emphasized in both the Notice of Proposed Removal and the Decision on Proposed Removal. This court has cited with approval the "principle of Board law holding that insolent disrespect toward supervisors seriously interferes with an agency's fulfillment of its mission." <span class="Italic">O'Neill v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 220 F.3d 1354, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Here, the evidence, including statements from Bartley and Strickland, confirms that Jenkins's misconduct had the effect of undermining senior officials in a way that interfered with the Agency's ability to function. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> J.A. 274 (Bartley stating that Jenkins "really had me believing a lot of things about people in HR/Leadership"); J.A. 266 (Strickland's Record of Interview noting that Jenkins "many times disparaged AHR employees by calling them backstabbers, dumb and that they did not know how to do their jobs, including AHR-1 and AHR-2").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Jenkins's pattern of misconduct created serious questions about the quality of her judgment. Once the messages were revealed, the Agency lost confidence and trust in Jenkins and her ability to perform her job in a senior leadership role. This court has recognized that loss of trust in an employee's judgment can be a sufficient nexus to support disciplinary action for misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 527 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Sanders v. United States Postal Serv</span>., 801 F.2d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These connections to Jenkins's job individually and collectively demonstrate that Jenkins's comments directly impacted the work environment at the FAA's Office of Human Resources Management. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that the misconduct had a nexus to the Agency's ability to perform its functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In challenging the Board's findings, Jenkins argues that her text messages did not affect the Agency's functions because they have nothing to do with safe air travel. But such an argument, if extended to its logical conclusion, would likely insulate most government employee misconduct from penalty. The law requiring a nexus to the Agency's "ability to perform its functions" should not be read so narrowly. Jenkins's misconduct directly affected the environment in which she worked--namely, the FAA's Office of Human Resources Management--and thus adversely affected the Agency's ability to function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jenkins also argues that there is no nexus because her comments "were intended to be and were private using personal cell phones and no government resources." Jenkins contends that "private off-duty speech is not intended to be the government's business" and "searching private speech for statements potentially subject to discipline is beyond the government's reach." But this is not a case in which the Agency violated Jenkins's right to privacy or free speech by illegally searching Jenkins's private communications for disciplinable conduct.[1] The offending text messages were provided to the Agency by its employees, Bartley and Strickland, in connection with the Agency's investigation into a complaint about a hostile work environment. Once Jenkins's misconduct and its effect on the work environment became known to the Agency, there was no law, rule, or regulation that prevented the Agency from addressing the misconduct merely because Jenkins used a personal phone to send messages that she "intended" to be private.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Though Jenkins raised an argument based on freedom of speech before the Board, she has not raised any Constitutional arguments in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Jenkins argues that a government employee can only be disciplined for speech if it is speech in public, in the workplace, or on social media. Jenkins attempts to support that argument by contrasting her allegedly "private" speech with instances in which federal employees have been disciplined for what she argues was non-private speech. But the comparison is inapposite. The fact that other federal employees have been disciplined for other misconduct does not immunize Jenkins's behavior from punishment in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Overall, Jenkins's arguments focus entirely on the "where," "when," and "how" of her misconduct--i.e., that it was done outside the workplace, while she was off-duty, using her personal phone--while ignoring the substance of what she actually did. The Board, by contrast, properly considered those circumstantial facts in the context of the actual misconduct, namely, that Jenkins repeatedly sent disparaging and racial comments to a subordinate and other employee about senior officials at the FAA. Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that such prolonged and persistent misconduct--whether achieved through text messages, in person, or by carrier pigeon--has a nexus to the work of the Agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to nexus established through presumption, "to comport with the requirements of due process, the presumption of satisfaction of the nexus requirement is rebuttable." <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3383) (off-duty conduct). To establish nexus for off-duty conduct, agencies often rely on rebuttable presumptions based on the nature of the conduct and on general expressions of loss of trust and confidence in the appellant. A person may be a villain off duty yet be a perfect employee. Does it enhance federal bureaucratic efficiency to remove a perfectly good key punch operator who punches people after hours? Removal of the puncher will no doubt slow down operations where he works, at least temporarily, but removal may enhance some vaguely defined confidence in the government as an employer of good citizens rather than a safe haven for criminals. Because the statute requires that an adverse action promote efficiency and not morality, the choices and proof become difficult; as a result, the law becomes confused. A statutory standard involving efficiency of government operations intertwined with public perceptions of the morality or decency of employees often leads to argument rather than evidence to prove the relation between private conduct and efficiency of the federal service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A means for substituting argument for evidence in nexus determinations is the "trust and confidence" formulation: nexus between off-duty misconduct and disciplinary action is established by managers who will state that they have lost confidence in the employee, regardless of the sustained excellent performance of the employee before and after the off-duty incident. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3342) ("A nexus may be established by showing that, as a result of the charged conduct, management lost trust and confidence in the employee's ability to perform her job.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is so much abstruse jargon in Board nexus decisions involving off-duty conduct that one can lose sight of the real issues involved. In words not since exceeded in elegance, Judge Bazelon put the matter squarely as he wrote for the court in <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy</span>, 417 F.2d 1161, 1165-167 (D.C. Cir. 1969), reviewing a decision of the Civil Service Commission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he notion that it could be an appropriate function of the federal bureaucracy to enforce the majority's conventional codes of conduct in the private lives of its employees is at war with elementary concepts of liberty, privacy, and diversity....&#8197;[A] finding that an employee has done something immoral or indecent could support a dismissal without further inquiry only if all immoral or indecent acts of an employee have some ascertainable deleterious effect on the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, appellee is now obliged to rely solely on this possibility of embarrassment to the agency to justify appellant's dismissal. The assertion of such a nebulous "cause" poses perplexing problems for a review proceeding which must accord broad discretion to the Commission....&#8197;[I]f the possibility of such transitory institutional discomfiture must be uncritically accepted as a cause for discharge which will "promote the efficiency of the service," we might as well abandon all pretense that the statute provides any substantive security for its supposed beneficiaries....&#8197;A reviewing court must at least be able to discern some reasonably foreseeable, specific connection between an employee's potentially embarrassing conduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision discounted the notion that loss of "trust" alone should be a sufficient basis to dismiss an employee for off-duty conduct unrelated to on-duty responsibilities, <span class="Italic">Gloster v. GSA</span>, 720 F.2d 700, 704 (D.C. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he "position of trust" theory seems to posit that past offenses may render one unworthy of government service regardless of the effect, or lack of effect, on the functioning of the agency. This theory, however, is contrary to the theory of the Civil Service Reform Act that disciplinary actions may be taken only in the service of efficiency. The federal government and society in general certainly do not condone welfare fraud, but punishment for such offenses is entrusted by the Act to the criminal process so long as the offense has no work-related effects....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2284"></span>Vintage circuit court decisions notwithstanding, the Board regularly finds nexus established by testimony concerning loss of trust, and the decisions cited in this discussion harken to that theme. Typical is <span class="Italic">Beasley v. DOD</span>, 52 MSPR 272, 275-76 (1992), involving a removal based on an off-duty assault and petty larceny:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency...presented testimony from two officials to the effect that the appellant's conviction adversely affected their trust and confidence in her. Henry Harris...the deciding official, testified that the appellant's conviction for aggravated assault, i.e., assault with a deadly weapon, raised concerns in his mind for the approximately 200 people who worked in the department. Management's apprehension for the safety of subordinate employees is a valid concern which is properly considered in determining whether nexus has been established....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Harris also testified that, in the appellant's position as a Packer, she had access to sensitive Government property, including hardware, clothing, and medical items, and that her petit larceny conviction caused him to be concerned with the possibility of theft of those items. He testified specifically that, based on her conviction, he did not trust the appellant not to take any of the items entrusted to her. His apprehensions were heightened, he explained, because the appellant worked the night shift where there was, overall, less supervision of employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">John Newberry, Supervisor, Packing Section, and the appellant's supervisor, testified that he would not feel comfortable with the appellant, based on her having pleaded guilty to the charges of aggravated assault and petit larceny.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, we find that the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the appellant's misconduct adversely affected the agency's trust and confidence in her job performance and that nexus, therefore, has been established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's guilty plea to charges of aggravated assault and petit larceny is a serious matter. As we have found above, there is a direct relationship between the larceny in particular, and the appellant's duties as a Packer of sensitive Government property. The offenses committed were intentional and the larceny of monies was for gain. As previously noted, although the appellant pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault and petit larceny her plea consolidated two indictments, each of which charged her with aggravated assault and petit larceny.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How well has the Board managed to avoid moral imperatives and conclusory findings relative to off-duty misconduct? Not too well, it seems, if you are the appellant. Too often resolution of nexus depends on the emotional impact of the off-duty conduct rather than on legal or logical analysis of the impact of that conduct on service efficiency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The leading nexus case is <span class="Italic">Merritt v. DOJ</span>, 6 MSPR 585, 6 MSPB 493, 601-02 (1981), involving a Bureau of Prisons correctional officer removed for using and sharing a small amount of marijuana with friends at home. The Board decided the nexus issue in relation to the efficiency of the service standard, 5 USC 7513(a), and the prohibited personnel practice provision, 5 USC 2302(b)(10), proscribing a personnel action taken for conduct that does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or the performance of duties. The latter statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(10)&#x2003;discriminate for or against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of conduct which does not adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant or the performance of others; except that nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit an agency from taking into account in determining suitability or fitness any conviction of the employee or applicant for any crime under the laws of any State, of the District of Columbia, or of the United States.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Merritt</span> observed that the most difficult question in nexus cases may be whether evidence of actual adverse impact on the service is necessary or whether rational explanation of hypothesized impact is adequate to establish the requisite connection to service efficiency. The opinion undertook analysis of judicial precedent and the legislative history of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(10). The judicial precedent showed a trend toward increasing scrutiny of nexus determinations, a trend the Board concluded was confirmed by discussion of the prohibited personnel practice provision during congressional debate over the Reform Act, 6 MSPR at 605-06:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that in enacting Section 2302(b)(10), Congress intended to make clear that in applying the efficiency of the service standard under Chapter 75 as well as in considering the alleged prohibited personnel practice, a nexus determination is essential and the law requires the Board and the courts to assure that such requirement is properly satisfied. Section 2302(b)(10) reflects Congressional approval of the Trend in judicial interpretation of the efficiency of the service standard, already apparent in mid-1978 but then still much disputed among the federal courts, toward closer scrutiny of nexus determinations made by agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]&#x2003;nexus determination must be based on evidence linking the employee's off-duty misconduct with the efficiency of the service, or in "certain egregious circumstances," on a presumption of nexus which may arise from the nature and gravity of the misconduct. In the latter situation, the presumption may be overcome by evidence showing an absence of adverse effect on service efficiency, in which case the agency may no longer rely solely on the presumption but must present evidence to carry its burden of proving nexus. The quantity and quality of the evidence which the agency need present in that circumstance would clearly then depend upon the nature and gravity of the particular misconduct as well as upon the strength of the showing made by the appellant in overcoming the otherwise applicable presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As with all factual questions in proceedings brought under 5 USC Chapter 75, the facts relied upon to establish a connection between the off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. Whether the facts as proven, including those established through any applicable presumption, logically support the conclusion that the agency discipline promotes the efficiency of the service is a question of law which must be decided in the affirmative before the action can be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board added, 6 MSPR at 606 n.40:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine nexus <span class="Italic">ex cathedra</span> as a matter purely of "law" would make nexus determinations a matter of irrebuttable legal presumption based potentially on the reviewing authority's visceral reaction to the offensiveness of particular off-duty conduct. While a degree of such risk may inhere also in determinations of whether any rebuttable presumption arises in particular cases, the opportunity to rebut such presumption on an individualized basis avoids the due process dangers that would arise from any irrebuttable presumption imposed as a matter of law....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Merritt</span> stated that in most cases, even those involving clearly criminal conduct, establishment of nexus need not and should not depend up assertion or speculation. In all cases the agency has the burden of establishing that the misconduct affects service efficiency. Nexus may not be presumed on the basis of a criminal conviction alone, without consideration of the character and seriousness of the offense. The Board observed that in only two judicial cases had a presumption of nexus been made: first, a criminal conviction of killing an individual without necessity, and, second, a particularly repellent act of child molestation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board found no nexus established as to the appellant in <span class="Italic">Merritt</span>. No logic supported a belief that because he used a small amount of marijuana at his home, the appellant would be more likely to break the employer's rules against introduction of contraband into the prison compound. His job performance was excellent; no evidence suggested the appellant might be the victim of blackmail as a result of his off-duty drug use. That the appellant's conduct was unlawful did not relieve the agency of its burden to establish the requisite nexus, particularly in view of limitations on the power of the government to intrude unnecessarily upon the discreet conduct of citizens, including federal employees, in the privacy of their homes. Chairwoman Prokop, who offered a concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Merritt</span>, stated that the issue of nexus is one of law rather than fact and should not require analysis under a preponderance of evidence test, replete with shifting burdens of proof. Her view was that there are certain classes of conduct permitting a finding of nexus without a factual demonstration of impact on service efficiency, once the underlying conduct is established through proof. Lesser misconduct would result in a finding of nexus only when there was a rational connection between the conduct and service efficiency, a question of logic rather than proof. The majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Merritt</span> would be reexamined and distinguished on slender grounds in <span class="Italic">Kruger v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 74 (1987) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-013.html#sec7-14">Off-Duty Drug Offense</a>") .</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In summary, "[a]n agency may establish nexus by showing that the employee's conduct: (1) Affected the employee's or his coworkers' job performance; (2) affected management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; or (3) interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission." <span class="Italic">Hunter v. DOJ</span>, 110 MSPR 219, 223 &#x00B6; 7, 2008 MSPB 236 (2008). Two conditions must be met to permit action against an employee if the nexus from off-duty misconduct is to be inferred without an explicit evidentiary demonstration by the agency. First, the particular misconduct must be egregious and of such a nature that the adverse effect of the employee's retention on service efficiency can reasonably be deemed substantial. "A requisite nexus cannot be presumed from the mere fact of criminal conviction alone, without regard to the character and seriousness of the offense." <span class="Italic">Arthur v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 239, 243 (1982). Second, under <span class="Italic">Arthur</span>, the employee must have failed to produce evidence rebutting the presumption that the employee's retention would have an adverse effect on the service. A disorderly conduct conviction did not qualify to establish presumptive nexus; there was no evidence of any connection between appellant's conviction and his ability to meet job <span id="Page_2285"></span>requirements in sensitive position. But, under <span class="Italic">Scheffler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 117 MSPR 499, &#x00B6; 12, 2012 MSPB 33 (2012), "[a]bsent a finding that the appellant's conduct was directly opposed to the agency's mission, the fact that his conduct was contrary to the "culture and values" of the agency, or that it was viewed with more disdain than would have been the case in another agency, does not warrant a finding of nexus." However, <span class="Italic">Scheffler</span> still examined the effect of off-duty conduct on management's trust in the employee's judgment and job performance.</p>
