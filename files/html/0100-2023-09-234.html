<p class="Body-Text">The interlocutory appeal procedure is described at 5 CFR 1201.91-.93 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.91 <span class="Italic">Explanation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by a judge during a proceeding. The judge may permit the appeal if he or she determines that the issue presented in it is of such importance to the proceeding that it requires the Board's immediate attention. Either party may make a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal. In addition, the judge, on his or her own motion, may certify an interlocutory appeal to the Board. If the appeal is certified, the Board will decide the issue and the judge will act in accordance with the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.92 <span class="Italic">Criteria for certifying interlocutory appeals.</span> The judge will certify a ruling for review only if the record shows that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An immediate ruling will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or denial of an immediate ruling will cause undue harm to a party or the public.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.93 <span class="Italic">Procedures</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motion for certification</span>. A party seeking the certification of an interlocutory appeal must file a motion for certification within 10 days of the date of the ruling to be appealed. The motion must be filed with the judge, and must state why certification is appropriate and what the Board should do and why. The opposing party may file objections within 10 days of the date of service of the motion, or within any other time period that the judge may designate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification and review</span>. The judge will grant or deny a motion for certification within five days after receiving all pleadings or, if no response is filed, within 10 days after receiving the motion. If the judge grants the motion for certification, he or she will refer the record to the Board. If the judge denies the motion, the party that sought certification may raise the matter at issue in a petition for review filed after the initial decision is issued, in accordance with &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.113 and 1201.114 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stay of appeal</span>. The judge has the authority to proceed with or to stay the processing of the appeal while an interlocutory appeal is pending with the Board. The passage of time during any stay granted under this section is not deemed, or accounted for, as a case suspension under Sec. 1201.28 of this part. If the judge does not stay the appeal, the Board may do so while an interlocutory appeal is pending with it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The certification process must be used to preserve a request for disqualification of an AJ or ALJ. Under 5 CFR 1201.42 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1201.42 <span class="Italic">Disqualifying a judge</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;If a judge considers himself or herself disqualified, he or she will withdraw from the case, state on the record the reasons for doing so, and another judge will be promptly assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A party may file a motion asking the judge to withdraw on the basis of personal bias or other disqualification. This motion must be filed as soon as the party has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification. The reasons for the request must be set out in an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (See appendix IV.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If the judge denies the motion, the party requesting withdrawal may request certification of the issue to the Board as an interlocutory appeal under &#x00A7; 1201.91 of this part. Failure to request certification is considered a waiver of the request for withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 6 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides procedural guidance to AJs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">INTRODUCTION</span>. An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by an AJ during the processing of the case. The Board's regulations governing interlocutory appeals are set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.91-.93.</p>

Under the Board's regulations, an AJ will certify an interlocutory appeal from a ruling only if the record shows that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate decision will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or the denial of an immediate decision will cause undue harm to a party or the public. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria Met</span>. Certain rulings, in the appropriate circumstances, might meet the criteria for certification. Examples are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, particularly when the jurisdictional issue is precedential (unlike granting the motion, which can quickly bring the case to the Board's attention through a PFR, its denial will lead to adjudication of the appeal and to potentially unnecessary expense and inconvenience for the parties, witnesses, and the AJ);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Denial or grant of a motion certifying a class action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Denial of a motion for permissive intervention;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Denial or grant of a motion to disqualify a designated representative;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Denial of a motion for production of evidence for which a privilege is claimed; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Denial of a stay request under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.10 (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria Not Met</span>. Certain rulings, by their very nature, generally do not meet the criteria for an interlocutory appeal. Examples are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Denial of a motion for a continuance;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Denial of a motion to amend a transcript;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_1218"></span>(3)&#x2003;Denial or grant of a motion concerning the production of witnesses;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Denial or grant of a motion concerning introduction of evidence (other than those rulings specified in a.5., above); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Denial of a motion to disqualify an AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PROCEDURES</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ruling</span>. The AJ must rule on motions for interlocutory appeals from his or her own rulings, as well as from rulings on the AJ's case made by other Board officials. The Board has noted that the interlocutory appeal regulations contemplate that the AJ will make a "ruling" and not merely certify a "question"; further, that an interlocutory appeal by its very nature does not deal with dispositive issues on the merits. <span class="Italic">Olson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 169 (2002). Thus, AJs should avoid certifying such matters to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opportunity to Object</span>. Before ruling on the motion, the AJ must allow the opposing party the opportunity to object to certification. As with other prehearing motions, the AJ should consider initiating a conference call with all parties to discuss the merits of the motion and any objections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Own Motion</span>. The AJ may also certify an issue to the Board on his or her own motion if it meets the regulatory criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Submission of Record to the Board</span>. If the motion is granted, or the AJ certifies the issue on his or her own motion, the AJ must send the record by standard overnight delivery to the OCB, within two workdays, except if the appeal has been designated an ECF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">STAYS PENDING INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS</span>. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.93(c), the AJ may stay all proceedings pending Board resolution of the certified issue or may choose to proceed with processing the appeal. The choice is committed to the AJ's sound discretion and may depend on whether any progress was made during the period while the interlocutory appeal is pending with the Board and may be undone by the Board's decision. The certification to the Board must clearly indicate which course of action the AJ is taking. The passage of time during any stay granted under this section is separate and distinct from the case suspension procedures under &#x00A7; 1201.28. If the AJ does not stay the processing of the appeal, the Board may do so while an interlocutory appeal is pending with it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In its Order 1050.1 (Nov. 7, 1979), the Board provided:</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">GUIDANCE ON INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Introduction</span>. Normally the Board will not consider a ruling made by a presiding official during the course of a proceeding until after the initial decision is issued. An exception to this rule is the procedure established for interlocutory appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.91-1201.93. This procedure which closely mirrors Federal district court procedure, 28 USCA 1291(b) (1966), allows a presiding official, under certain conditions, to certify a ruling to the Board for review before the initial decision is issued. The decision of the Board on the interlocutory appeal must be followed by the presiding official in the adjudication of the case. The purpose of this procedure is to allow the Board the opportunity to provide to presiding officials, agencies, and appellants "immediate precedent-setting interpretations" of the Reform Act and its regulations. 44 Fed. Reg. 38346 (1979). Its purpose is not to absolve presiding officials from the responsibility of processing their cases or making difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ruling</span>. A ruling by the presiding official is a condition precedent to an interlocutory appeal. A presiding official may not certify a question of law or policy to the Board unless he/she has previously ruled on the question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Motion for Certification</span>. A presiding official may not certify a ruling as an interlocutory appeal on his/her own motion. An interlocutory appeal may be taken only after a party affected by the ruling files a motion for certification. It must be filed within five [now ten] days of the moving party's receipt of the ruling, and it must include arguments in support of both the certification and the desired determination to be made by the Board. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.93(a). A party may move for certification of any ruling made during the course of a proceeding. Like other motions, it must be filed in writing unless presented at a hearing. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.55(a). If the motion is not properly filed in a timely fashion, the presiding official may refuse to consider it. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opportunity to Object</span>. Before granting the motion, the presiding official must provide the other parties the opportunity to object to certification, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.55(b), and to submit argument supporting the decision which they desire the Board to make if an interlocutory appeal is taken. If the motion is made at a hearing, responses generally should be required immediately. In unusual cases involving complex issues, the presiding official may provide a party up to five days to submit a response. If the motion is submitted in writing, the presiding official is required to serve the motion on the other parties. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.55(a). The parties generally should be given five days to submit their responses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Ruling on the Motion</span>. The presiding official must grant or deny the motion within five days of the date the last pleading is received or is due, whichever happens first. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.93(b). If the motion is granted, the presiding official must issue a written order containing: 1) a brief summary of the challenged ruling, including a statement of the reasons for the ruling; 2) a finding that the criteria for certification are met; 3) a statement of the question of law or policy to be reviewed by the Board; and 4) a ruling on whether the proceedings are stayed. If the motion is denied, the presiding official's ruling may be made orally at a hearing or in a written order. In either instance, the ruling must contain a summary of the challenged ruling and a statement of the reasons for the denial of the motion for certification. The Chief Appeals Officer should be consulted before a presiding official makes a ruling on a motion for Certification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Transmittal of Order Granting Appeal</span>. The presiding official must send by pouch mail (or, in the case of the Washington, D.C. Field Office, hand-carry) five copies of the order and the duplicate copy of the case file to the Office of the Secretary no later than the day after the motion is granted. Copies of the order must also be sent to the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria for Certification</span>. A presiding official may not certify a ruling for review unless it involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and either 1) an immediate ruling would materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or 2) the denial of an immediate ruling would cause undue harm to a party or the public. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Question of Law or Policy</span>. The interlocutory appeal procedure is not designed for review of factual issues; it is designed solely for review of issues of law and policy. Accordingly, motions for certification which involve factual issues may not be granted. Similarly, motions which contest rulings involving the presiding official's discretion rather than an alleged error in the application of law or policy may not be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Important Question</span>. The question of law or policy must be important. To be important the question does not need to be dispositive of the case. A question is important if it involves a significant interpretation of the Reform Act or the Board's regulations. A question is also important if an erroneous ruling would require the Board, upon review of the initial decision, to remand the case for additional proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Substantial Difference of Opinion</span>. This criterion is intended to prevent frivolous and dilatory appeals to the Board. A substantial difference of opinion exists if, after reviewing the pleadings and all applicable law and policy, the presiding official reaches the conclusion that it would not be unreasonable for the Board, in the exercise of its judgment, to reverse the challenged ruling. Among others, rulings that follow or are logically derived from Board precedent or policy do not qualify as raising questions about which a substantial difference of opinion exists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Materially Advance the Completion of the Proceeding</span>. An interlocutory appeal materially advances the completion of the proceeding if the appeal decreases the amount of time needed to adjudicate the case. In making this judgment, the presiding official should weigh the delay in adjudication that may result from the interlocutory appeal against the time that may be saved by obtaining an immediate decision from the Board. An immediate decision from the Board could save time in adjudicating a case by preventing unnecessary proceedings and remands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Undue Harm to a Party or the Public</span>. Virtually every ruling by a presiding official could be construed as causing harm to at least one party. In some instances, a ruling could also be construed as causing harm to public interests (e.g., a ruling to close a hearing). However, in order to meet this criterion the ruling must cause undue harm. This criterion is met if a presiding official's ruling, if erroneous, would cause harm to a party or the public which could not be adequately remedied unless the Board reverses the ruling before it is effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Examples</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;The following are examples of rulings which, under some sets of circumstances, might meet the criteria for an interlocutory appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;Ruling denying a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2.&#x2003;Ruling denying or granting a motion for certification of a class action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_1219"></span>3.&#x2003;Ruling denying a motion for permissive intervention;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">4.&#x2003;Ruling denying a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">5.&#x2003;Ruling denying a motion for disqualification of presiding official;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">6.&#x2003;Ruling granting or denying a motion for disqualification of a representative;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">7.&#x2003;Ruling granting or denying a motion for production of evidence for which a privilege is claimed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;The following are examples of rulings which, under some sets of circumstances, might not meet the criteria for an interlocutory appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;Ruling denying or granting a motion for continuance;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2.&#x2003;Ruling denying or granting a motion to amend a transcript;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">3.&#x2003;Rulings on witness lists;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">4.&#x2003;Rulings on objections to the admission of evidence other than those related to claims of privilege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;The examples above are set forth for purposes of illustration only. Presiding officials may not make a ruling on a motion for certification on the basis of these examples; a ruling on a motion for certification may be made only on the basis of the regulatory criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stays</span>. A presiding official has three processing options pending the Board's decision on an interlocutory appeal: 1) He/she may enforce the appealed ruling and proceed with the case as if the appeal had not been filed; 2) he/she may stay the effect of the ruling and proceed with the remainder of the case; or 3) he/she may stay the entire proceeding. Generally, the presiding official should enforce the appealed ruling and proceed with the adjudication of the case. The entire proceeding should be stayed only if a Board decision is of such importance that the case cannot proceed without it. 44 Fed. Reg. 38346 (1979). Instead of staying the entire proceeding, however, the presiding official should stay only the effect of the appealed ruling and proceed with the remainder of the case if by this action the completion of the proceeding is materially advanced and no undue harm to the parties or the public results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional Guidance</span>. Because &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.91-1201.93 are patterned after Federal district court procedures, court decisions may be used as additional guidance to determine whether a motion for certification should be granted or denied, and if granted, whether the proceeding should be stayed pending the outcome of the interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board Order noted that the interlocutory appeal procedure is not designed for review of factual issues; it is only for review of issues of law and policy. As an example of what is not a question of law or policy, the Board declined in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 412, 417-18 (1991), to fault the AJ for refusing to certify whether the appellant's request for a hearing was untimely filed. No error was committed by an AJ who declined to certify as an interlocutory appeal the AJ's denial of a continuance of a hearing, and his use instead of a dismissal without prejudice (while the Board, during the same period, was considering another case concerning implications of past discipline upon current charges). <span class="Italic">Black v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 204, 207 &#x00B6; 8 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Order, an interlocutory appeal materially advances the completion of the proceeding if the appeal decreases the amount of time needed to adjudicate the case. If there is an alternative basis for resolving the appeal that eliminates the need for interlocutory certification, the more expeditious route should be taken and the certification avoided. <span class="Italic">Bergstein v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 495, 497 n.* (1985) (suggesting that dismissal of the case for lack of prosecution would have been preferable to certification to the Board of an allegation of bias of the AJ); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Keefer v. USDA</span>, 92 MSPR 476, 480 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (AJ properly denied interlocutory review when the issue did not involve an important question of policy or law and the appellants could challenge the AJ's rulings through a PFR); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. SSA</span>, DC-0752-15-0053-I-1 (NP 1/6/2017) (denial of an interlocutory appeal concerning whether an interpreter would be supplied for the appellant under Executive Order 13166 requiring agencies to provide a system allowing a Limited English Proficient person to meaningfully access the agency's services: "the appellant has now had an opportunity to challenge the administrative judge's underlying ruling on review, and thus any interlocutory certification was not necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2012).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other than the parameters set by the regulation, it is in the AJ's discretion to determine whether to certify an interlocutory appeal. An example of an unusual use of the procedure is <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 435, 438-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-17 (1998), considering and affirming through an interlocutory appeal an AJ's order directing that the agency be sanctioned for obstruction of discovery by refusing to permit various agency witnesses to testify as to an adverse action. No Board regulation provides for or excludes briefs on an interlocutory appeal. The Board declined to accept briefs when they would not "shed light on the certified issues." <span class="Italic">Jonson v. FDIC</span>, 121 MSPR 56, 60 n.1, 2014 MSPB 22 (2014) (dissent by Member Robbins) (citing <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 120 MSPR 163, 2013 MSPB 74 (2013), disallowing briefs in the interest of expediting the interlocutory review process).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An interlocutory appeal may be mooted by intervening events. In <span class="Italic">Montee v. DOJ</span>, 84 MSPR 1, 4-6 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 14 (1999), the AJ determined that the respondent should be sanctioned because another agency controlling records relevant to the appeal would not release them to the appellant. The AJ certified to the Board the propriety of the orders compelling discovery and imposing sanctions. While the interlocutory appeal was pending, the agency that controlled the records disclosed them. The appellant's discovery objective having been obtained, the AJ's discovery order was moot. No sanctions were appropriate.</p>
