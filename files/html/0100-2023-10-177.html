<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-178"><span class="space">3.</span> Hearing</h4>
<p class="noindent">The regional director's investigation need not include a hearing, as long as the parties are offered an opportunity to present their evidence on objections. <span class="Italic">Pac. Missile Test Ctr. and NAGE Local R12-33</span>, 31 FLRA 996, 1001 (1988). If there is a hearing, objections to its conduct should show how excluded evidence would have caused a different result. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Watervliet Arsenal and NFFE Local 2109</span>, 34 FLRA 98, 108-09 (1989). Sequestration of witnesses is within the "broad discretion" of the hearing officer. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Aviation Support Detachment and NAIL,</span> 64 FLRA 252, 255 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Fleet &#x0026; Industrial Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 2326,</span> 62 FLRA 497, 501 (2008), discerned no error in denial of a hearing concerning claimed accretion of employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.30(b) of the Authority's Regulations, an RD "will issue a notice of hearing to inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact exists, and any time there is a reasonable cause to believe a question exists regarding unit appropriateness." Then, "<span class="Italic">if</span> [the RD] has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, [the RD] shall provide an opportunity for a hearing[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b) (emphasis added). Interpreting these provisions, the Authority has held that RDs <span id="page_169"></span>have "broad discretion" to determine whether a hearing is necessary. <span class="Italic">United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, </span>61 FLRA 417, 420 (2005), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 61 FLRA 806 (2006) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">see Fed. Mediation &#x0026; Conciliation Serv., </span>52 FLRA 1509, 1516 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FMCS</span>). In particular, "the RD may determine, on the basis of the investigation...that 'there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">quoting United States Dep't of Agric. Forest Serv., Apache-Sitgreaves Nat'l Forest, Springerville, Ariz., </span>47 FLRA 945, 952 (1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD conducted several telephone conferences with the parties in which she gave all of the parties opportunities to present evidence.&#x2003;After completing her investigation, the RD determined, and notified the parties, that a hearing was not required. The Regulations simply require the RD to make such investigation as the RD "deems necessary," which the RD did in this matter. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.30(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE's reliance on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2422.18(a) and 2422.16(c) is misplaced. Under &#x00A7; 2422.18(a), a representation hearing is "investigatory" and "not adversarial." The purpose of such a hearing "is to develop a full and complete record of relevant and material facts." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The wording of this regulatory provision describes the purpose of representation hearings, and there is nothing in the wording that compels a hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2422.16(c) provides, in pertinent part, that "<span class="Italic">[b]</span> <span class="Italic">efore directing an election</span>, the Regional Director shall provide affected parties an opportunity for a hearing on other than procedural matters[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.16(c) (emphasis added). This regulatory provision is not applicable because, as discussed above, the RD did not direct an election in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that NAGE and IFPTE have not demonstrated that the RD erred as a matter of law or committed a prejudicial procedural error by not holding a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">EPA, </span>61 FLRA at 420.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provided indirect guidance as to when hearings will be held and how they will be obtained in a refusal-to-bargain case, <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 40 FLRA 775 (1991), that stemmed from the agency's refusal to recognize the union following the conclusion of representational proceedings that were reviewed in <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 952, 952-53 (1990). In the ULP cases, FLRA explained as to regional hearings on representation issues, 40 FLRA at 782-84:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent admits that it is attempting to challenge the Union's certification through this unfair labor practice proceeding. With regard to the merits of its actions, it has raised in this proceeding only the two arguments we addressed in our decision in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>. After careful consideration of the Respondent's brief in this case, we conclude that the Respondent is merely attempting to relitigate that decision. It has offered no new evidence or previously unavailable evidence or special circumstances warranting an entitlement to relitigate issues that were or could have been litigated in the prior representation proceeding....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so concluding, we have considered the Respondent's assertion that it has previously presented sufficient evidence on its objection to the RD's findings regarding the alleged direct conferral of benefits to warrant the holding of an evidentiary hearing. It argues that the failure to hold such a hearing presents serious due process problems....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent requests the hearing to determine whether the Union's conduct of providing free legal assistance to five employees was publicized by the Union or the five employees, thus affecting the results, and warranting setting aside, the election. There is no question that the Union provided the assistance. We find, however, that the Respondent has not, in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> or in this case, made an offer of proof sufficient to raise a substantial and material factual issue warranting a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anchor Inns, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 644 F.2d 292 (3d Cir. 1981), in which the court held that a party is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if its objection raises substantial and material issues of fact. The court held that in order to obtain an evidentiary hearing, the objector's proffer of evidence must on its face warrant setting aside the election. The proffer "may not be conclusory or vague; it must point to specific events and specific people." 644 F.2d at 296<span class="Italic">. See also</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Claxton Mfg. Co. Inc.</span>, 613 F.2d 1364, 1365 (5th Cir. 1980)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Claxton</span>, the court held that to obtain a hearing, the losing party bears a heavy burden; its affidavits must contain specific evidence of specific events from or about specific people. The court held that conclusory allegations are not sufficient....&#8197;In addition, the court held that when the objecting party establishes a right to a hearing, the Regional Director's investigation of objections will not be a substitute for a hearing. Due in part to the opinion in <span class="Italic">Claxton</span> and other court decisions requiring evidentiary hearings in certain circumstances, the NLRB reexamined its procedures for disposing of post-election objections to the conduct of elections and amended its rules and regulations. The revised regulations state that a hearing "shall be conducted with respect to those objections or challenges which the regional director concludes raise substantial and material factual issues." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 102.69(d); <span class="Italic">Erie Coke &#x0026; Chemical Co.</span>, 261 NLRB 25 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not presented any evidence in either this proceeding or in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> as to the possible influence of the Union's conduct on other employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 FLRA at 963. As in the earlier case, there is no showing here to indicate that a hearing might establish that the Union or the terminated employees publicized the Union's representation of the employees in question during the election campaign. The Respondent offered no affidavits or other evidence to support its claim that the Union or the employees publicized the Union's conduct. Rather, the Respondent argues only that "it defies logic to conclude that no one was aware these employees were receiving free legal services from [the Union]."...&#8197;This argument falls far short of the required offers of proof. It points to neither specific events nor specific people and is merely conclusory in nature....&#8197;Thus, adopting the private sector standard, we conclude that the Respondent has not made an offer of proof sufficient to raise a substantial and material factual issue warranting a hearing. We find it to be significant, in disposing of this issue, that...the Union's preelection conduct of providing free legal assistance to five employees did not materially affect the results of the nationwide election in which over 1,800 ballots were cast.</p>

Missile Test Ctr.</span>, 31 FLRA 996, 1000-01 (1988) (regional director need not conduct hearing, as long as parties are offered opportunity to provide evidence on objections in representation case), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Springerville, Ariz., and NFFE</span>, 47 FLRA 945, 951-53 (1993), involving a remand to the region for determination of factual disputes concerning the nature of pre-election meetings between management, employees, and representatives of one union, factual disputes were to be resolved by hearing unless a hearing became unnecessary through a supplemental regional investigation or stipulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When objections to an election are filed, the RD conducts an investigation. If the RD determines that no relevant question of fact exists, he may issue a decision and order on objections. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 2422.21(c) and (d) of our Regulations. However, "[w]here it appears to the Regional Director that the objections...raise any relevant question of fact..., the Regional Director shall cause to be issued a notice of hearing." <span class="Italic">See</span> section 2422.21(g) of our Regulations. This is not to say that a hearing must be held in all cases where questions of fact are raised. The RD may determine, on the basis of the investigation or by stipulation of the parties, that there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without holding a hearing, the RD resolved disputed questions of fact and based his decision on those findings of fact. However, in the absence of a hearing on those questions of fact, the RD's decision in the circumstances of this case is without a proper factual foundation and has prejudicially affected the rights of the Activity within the meaning of section 2422.17(c)(4) of our Regulations. We will remand this matter to the RD to take appropriate action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our order does not preclude further investigation by the RD, or a stipulation of facts by the parties, in order to establish facts on the basis of which the RD could render a new decision and order. The investigation, or hearing, if one is held, shall address the unresolved questions of fact raised by Objection 3, as well as by Objection 2. The ultimate issue for resolution by the RD is whether, under all the facts and circumstances as determined by the RD, the Activity's conduct violated the Activity's obligation under the Statute to maintain its neutrality or was of such an objectionable nature as to require that the election be set aside because of the potential for interfering with the free choice of the voters.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority's current Regulation addressing investigations of objections is &#x00A7; 2422.30(a), which states that "[t]he [RD] will investigate the petition and any other matter as the [RD] deems necessary."[37] In this regard, it is well established that RDs have discretion to determine the scope of the investigation of objections, including whether or not to hold a hearing.[38] In exercising this discretion, the RD may determine that "there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision, or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision."[39] The Authority also has stated that, given the RD's discretion, the objecting party has a "heavy burden" to show that the exercise of that discretion in the conduct of the investigation resulted in prejudicial errors.[40] In particular, the Authority has stated that "successful challenges to the scope of an RD's investigation must show that further investigation could have provided evidence 'sufficient to warrant setting aside the RD's findings and conclusions.'"[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD stated that she conducted an investigation and that the Agency did not demonstrate that a hearing was required. In particular, the RD found that the Agency's objections challenged only her legal conclusions concerning whether: (1) impounding the ballots was proper; (2) eligible employees were denied the opportunity to vote; and (3) she had the authority to tally the ballots. Here, the Agency's arguments essentially reiterate those same objections. Moreover, the RD found that the Agency "[had] not demonstrate[d] that there [were] substantial and material facts in dispute." And, similarly, here, the Agency does not explain what specific facts were in dispute, or why the record in this case was insufficient for the RD to resolve the Agency's objections without a hearing. Consequently, the Agency's arguments do not establish that a factual dispute existed to require a hearing.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues first that the RD erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing.&#x2003;We disagree. Under section 2422.21(g) [now 2422.30] of the Authority's Regulations, the determination of whether to hold an evidentiary hearing is within the RD's discretion. <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 952, 963-64 (1990). Further, a hearing need not be held whenever questions of fact are raised, because the RD may determine that "there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Apache-Sitqreaves Nat'l Forest, Springerville, Arizona</span>, 47 FLRA 945, 952 (1993). The standard to determine whether a hearing is warranted is: (1) whether an offer of proof raises a substantial and material issue of fact; and (2) whether that factual issue is necessary to the resolution of the case<span class="Italic">.

Moreover, such evidence "must on its face warrant setting aside the election." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 782.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the use of a hearing in a unit clarification case involving analysis of an employee's supervisory responsibilities, <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Chattahoochee-Oconee Nat'l Forest and NFFE</span>, 43 FLRA 911, 914 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The RD conducted an investigation of NFFE's petition and determined to issue a decision without conducting a hearing. Nothing in our Regulations required the RD to hold a hearing. Our Regulations specifically allow a Regional Director to "make such investigation as the Regional Director deems necessary." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.4(f)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that NFFE was not precluded from presenting evidence to support its position during the RD's investigation....</p>
<p class="noindent">A hearing was not required in a consolidation case, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Travis AFB and AFGE</span>, 64 FLRA 1, 5-6 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity contends that the RD erred in refusing to conduct a hearing because, according to the Activity, a hearing was required as there is a question concerning representation and there is an issue of unit appropriateness. Section 7111 (b) of the Statute requires a hearing when there is reasonable cause to believe that a question concerning representation exists. However, the petition in this case was filed under &#x00A7; 7112(d) of the Statute, and, by definition, a unit consolidation petition does not raise a question concerning representation because it does not question whether the exclusive representative will continue as such. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE, AFL-CIO,</span> 23 FLRA 106, 108 (1986). Although the proposed consolidated unit must be appropriate to be consolidated under &#x00A7; 7112(d), nothing in &#x00A7; 7112(d) either explicitly or implicitly requires a hearing regarding the proposed consolidation. With no mention of a hearing in &#x00A7; 7112(d), any requirement to have provided a hearing is governed by &#x00A7; 2422.30(b) of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.30(b), an RD "will issue a notice of hearing to inquire into any matter about which a material issue of fact exists, and any time there is reasonable cause to believe a question concerning representation exists regarding unit appropriateness." Under this provision, RDs have "broad discretion" to determine whether a hearing is necessary. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy Fleet and Industrial Supply Ctr., Norfolk, Va.,</span> 62 FLRA 497, 501 (2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Envt'l. Prot. Agency,</span> 61 FLRA 417, 420 (2005)). In exercising this discretion, the RD may determine that "there are sufficient facts not in dispute to form the basis for a decision or that, even where some facts are in dispute, the record contains sufficient evidence on which to base a decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agric, Forest Serv., Apache-Sitgreaves Nat'l Forest, Springerville, Ariz.,</span> 47 FLRA 945, 952 (1993)). Although <span class="Italic">Navy Fleet </span>did not involve a consolidation petition, it did involve a determination of the appropriateness of the units involved, and the Authority specifically held that the regional director did not err by failing to conduct a hearing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In denying the Activity's motion for a hearing, the RD directed an investigation during which the parties attempted, but failed, to reach a stipulation of facts. After providing both parties additional opportunity to provide evidence, the RD provided the opportunity for filing briefs. In addition, the RD considered the Activity's brief over the objection of the Union as necessary to appropriately resolve the petition. The Authority's Regulations require the RD to make such investigation as the RD "deems necessary[.]" &#x00A7; 2422.30(a). This is what the RD did in this matter. Moreover, Authority precedent requires only that there be sufficient undisputed facts to form the basis for decision. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys., West Haven, Conn.,</span> 61 FLRA 864, 870 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Activity fails to establish that a hearing was required either under the Statute or &#x00A7; 2422.30(b) of the Authority's Regulations and fails to show how the record in this case was insufficient for the RD to resolve the petition. Accordingly, we conclude that the application for review does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law or committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter in failing to conduct a hearing.</p>
