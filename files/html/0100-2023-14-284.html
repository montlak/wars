<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-285"><span class="space">H.</span> REHABILITATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">With brief discussion referencing OPM requirements that agencies provide counseling and referral services, FLRA determined to be within the scope of bargaining Proposal 7, Section A, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1113, 1115 (1990), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to other proposals</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1161-63 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees whose tests have been confirmed positive...will be referred in writing to an Employee Assistance Program Counselor for counseling and/or rehabilitation. Employees will be informed of the consequences should they refuse counseling or rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1113, 1116 (1990) (Proposal 7, Section C), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to other proposals</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1161-63 (D.C. Cir. 1992), was the requirement that "[p]rior to implementation of the drug testing program, the parties will meet and negotiate a strong, effective Employees Assistance Program providing for education, treatment, and rehabilitation." The proposal did no more than require adherence by the agency to legal requirements set by FPM Chapter 792 for creation of EAPs (with the support and active participation of labor organizations). <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 889 (1991) (Proposal 7C: approving same proposal). FLRA did not require negotiation of a proposal requesting rehabilitative services at no cost to the employee or to family members of the employee. Under the former FPM Supplement 792-2, subch. S6-3, and supporting decisions of the Comptroller General, the employee may be required to bear the cost of his or her drug problem. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 889, 892-93 (1991) (Proposals 7A, B).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 31 FLRA 118, 125-30 (1988), permitted negotiation of a proposal that restated provisions of the Executive Order governing referral to rehabilitation, but declared nonnegotiable a portion of the proposal that dictated what the agency would do with the employee's position during and after rehabilitation. Also nonnegotiable was a proposal requiring rehabilitation for employees who tested positive for drug use. The proposal precluded disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2058 and Army Aberdeen Proving Ground</span>, 31 FLRA 241, 248-49 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">Without directly discussing disciplinary action, FLRA determined to be negotiable a proposal demanding that employees be returned to duty after successful completion of rehabilitation, but ruled nonnegotiable was a requirement that, upon their return, the employees remain in their original positions, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 895-99 (1991) (Proposal 7D):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 7D is inconsistent with section 5(c) of Executive Order 12564 by requiring the Agency to return an employee to a sensitive position without regard to a determination by management that the employee will not pose a danger to the public health, safety, or national security. We disagree. Section 5(c) of the Executive Order applies to employees in sensitive positions. However, neither the language of the proposal nor the Union's expressed intent establishes that the proposal is limited to employees occupying sensitive positions. Consequently, the Agency's contention that the proposal is inconsistent with the Executive Order does not apply to employees not occupying sensitive positions. To the extent the proposal would apply to employees in sensitive positions, however, we also do not find it to be inconsistent with the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Agency's contentions are predicated on a misreading of the Union's proposal. Section 5(c) [of the Executive Order] provides that agencies shall not allow employees who occupy sensitive positions and who are found to use illegal drugs to remain on duty, prior to successful completion of rehabilitation through an EAP. Section 5(c) further states that "as part of a rehabilitation or counseling program," an agency head retains the discretion to allow an employee to return to duty in a sensitive position if it is determined that such action would not pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security. Section 5(c) of Executive Order 12564. Contrary to the Agency's arguments, however, and based on the language of the proposal and the Union's stated intent, the proposal clearly pertains only to those instances in which an employee has successfully completed rehabilitation. Consequently, the Agency's reliance on the portion of section 5(c) which permits the Agency to return an employee to duty "as part of a rehabilitation or counseling program," is inapposite. Moreover, we find nothing in section 5(c) or the Agency's arguments to support a finding that the return of an employee occupying a sensitive position after that employee successfully completes rehabilitation through an EAP is inconsistent with the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that the proposal directly interferes with the exercise of various management rights. First, the Agency argues that the proposal interferes with its right to determine internal security practices because only the Agency can determine whether an employee continues to pose a risk to the Agency's internal security after successful completion of rehabilitation. We agree with the Agency as to the second sentence of the proposal but reject the argument as to the first sentence of the proposal. The first sentence of the proposal would not require the Agency to place an employee in a position that would compromise the Agency's internal security. Instead, the Agency could choose where the employee would be placed. In contrast, the second sentence of the proposal could require the Agency to return an employee to a sensitive position, if that is the position originally held. The Agency would be prevented from determining, based on the nature of an employee's original position and duties, that the return of the employee would compromise the Agency's internal security.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency argues that the proposal interferes with management's right to assign employees within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. We agree and find that both sentences of the proposal interfere with management's right to assign employees. The Agency has the right to determine the positions to which employees will be assigned. Proposal 7D would require the Agency to place employees in positions, after they have successfully completed rehabilitation, without regard to whether any positions are available. We find nothing in the Executive Order, the Guidelines, or any other authority pertaining to drug testing, and none has been cited by the Union, that requires an agency to ensure that positions are available for employees who have been found to use illegal drugs, notwithstanding their successful completion of rehabilitation. Additionally, the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees to the extent that the second sentence of the proposal could require the Agency to return an employee to a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency contends that Proposal 7D interferes with its rights to assign work and to discipline employees. These contentions must be rejected. The proposal says nothing about the particular duties that will be assigned, when work assignments will occur, or to whom or what positions work assignments will be made. Similarly, the proposal is silent as to the Agency's ability to discipline employees. Consequently, we find no basis on which to conclude that the proposal directly interferes with these rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the first sentence of the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees, we further find, however, that it does not excessively interfere with that right. In weighing the competing interests of the Union and the Agency, we find that the benefits to employees afforded by this portion of the proposal outweigh the burdens imposed on the Agency. Maintaining available positions to which employees can return following completion of rehabilitation clearly constitutes a significant benefit to employees who have successfully completed such a program. Employees who have been found to use illegal drugs are provided an important incentive to successfully complete rehabilitation if there is an expectation of continued employment. Previously, we have recognized that an agency's implementation of its drug testing program can adversely affect employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1077. Clearly, the maintenance of job security is one way to alleviate the adverse consequences flowing to employees as a result of the Agency's drug testing program. Moreover, studies indicate that the vast majority of employees who are subjected to drug testing are not using illegal drugs. Consequently, the requirement to maintain available positions for those employees who return following successful completion of rehabilitation would involve few, if any, positions. On the other hand, there has been no contention by the Agency that it would be unable to provide positions for employees who return after successful completion of rehabilitation. Consequently, under the circumstances presented in this case we find that the first sentence of Proposal 7D constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find, however, that the second sentence of Proposal 7D would excessively interfere with the Agency's rights to determine its internal security practices and to assign employees. This portion of the proposal would require the Agency to return an employee to a sensitive position, if that was the position originally held, following successful completion of rehabilitation. As we stated previously, this requirement would operate without regard to the Agency's internal security concerns. The Agency would be prevented from determining, based on the nature of the employee's position and the duties attendant to that position, whether the employee continues to pose a risk to the Agency's internal security. While <span id="page_823"></span>it is possible that an employee's successful completion of rehabilitation would eliminate some of the Agency's internal security concerns, the inability to make a determination on an individual employee basis places an undue burden on the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Additionally, the Agency would have no choice as to which position the employee would be returned. The Agency would have to maintain, as available, the position previously occupied by the affected employee until such time as the employee returned from rehabilitation. By requiring the Agency to assign a returning employee to the position previously held by that employee, the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees. We find that such a requirement imposes a greater burden on the Agency than the first sentence of the proposal, which simply required the Agency to return employees to duty, and did not specify the particular position into which a returning employee would be placed. Therefore, on balance, we conclude that the second sentence of Proposal 7D does not constitute a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of HUD Locals and DHUD</span>, 43 FLRA 1405, 1406, 1412-13 (1992), was Proposal 3: "Management recognizes that the Rehabilitation Act precludes the termination of employees based on substance abuse when such employees enroll in rehabilitation programs":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 concerns a limitation on the Agency's right to remove an employee based on substance abuse when the employee enrolls in a rehabilitation program.... [S]ection 5(d) of the Executive Order requires agencies to "initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs" and refuses to enter counseling or rehabilitation, or subsequently fails to remain drug-free, and section 5.d(8) of the FPM Letter states that "initiating action to remove the employee from Federal service is mandatory upon a second verified finding of illegal drug use." Therefore, the Executive order and the FPM Letter require termination of an employee for use of illegal drugs in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 42 FLRA at 420 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Rehabilitation Act imposes a duty on Federal agencies to make reasonable accommodations for the limitations of their qualified handicapped employees unless they can show that to do so would impose undue hardship on their operations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 42 FLRA 1186, 1192 (1991). The Rehabilitation Act, as amended, extends its definition of "individual with handicaps" to an individual who has successfully completed or is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the use of illegal drugs, or is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use but is not, in fact, engaging in such use. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(8)(C)(i) and (ii). However, an "individual with handicaps" does not include "an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(8)(C)(i)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As worded, the proposal would bar the Agency from removing an employee who it finds is using illegal drugs after enrolling in a rehabilitation program. Additionally, the proposal makes no distinction between substance abusers who voluntarily identify themselves and those identified through other than voluntary means, such as random drug testing. Because the proposal insulates from removal employees who the Agency determines are using illegal drugs after they have enrolled in a treatment program, as well as employees who are identified through involuntary means, and because the Rehabilitation Act also does not require such protection, we conclude that the proposal conflicts with section 5(d) of the Executive Order and section 5.d(8) of the FPM Letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]ecause Proposal 3 conflicts with law and Government-wide regulation, it is nonnegotiable and there is no need to consider the additional arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Energy</span>, 41 FLRA 1241, 1260, 1261-65 (1991), was Provision 2, that employees be exempt from "reasonable suspicion drug testing" during rehabilitation, for up to 30 days:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's assertion that Provision 2 "simply entitles [an] employee to his/her rights under the Rehabilitation Act." The Union cites no provision of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (the Act), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., which would preclude the Agency from conducting reasonable suspicion drug testing during an employee's rehabilitation period. Moreover, section 7(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(8)(C), as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, 512, 104 Stat. 327, provides the following with respect to the definition of "individual with handicaps" under the Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)(i)For purposes of subchapter V of this chapter, the term "individuals with handicaps" do not include an individual who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when a covered entity acts on the basis of such use.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Nothing in clause (i) shall be construed to exclude as an individual with handicaps an individual who--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(I)&#x2003;has successfully completed a supervised drug rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs, or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(II)&#x2003;is participating in a supervised rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in such use; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(III)&#x2003;is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use, but is not engaging in such use;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">except that it shall not be a violation of this chapter for a covered entity to adopt or administer reasonable policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug testing, designed to ensure that an individual described in subclause (I) or (II) is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> H. Conf. Rep. No. 101-336, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 565, 597 (joint explanatory statement accompanying the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 stated that nothing in amendments to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(8)(C) "shall be construed to encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the conducting of testing for the illegal use of drugs.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the reference in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(8)(C) to drug testing and its legislative history, and as no provision of the Act precluding such testing has been cited or is otherwise apparent to us, we reject the Union's contention that "[i]f the Agency is allowed to test an employee while they are undergoing rehabilitation, the Agency has violated the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Agency's assertion that the provision interferes with its right to determine its internal security practices, we note that in <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 128 and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA 1500, 1525-27 (1991) (Proposal 14),...we addressed a proposal which precluded the agency from administering drug tests, on a random or other basis, to employees during the first 60 days of rehabilitation. We held, as relevant here, that because the proposal established substantive criteria governing the agency's exercise of its right to determine its internal security practices, the proposal directly interfered with that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 would prohibit the Agency from administering drug tests based on reasonable suspicion to employees who are in a rehabilitation program for at least the first 30 days of the program.&#x2003;The prohibition would be extended beyond the 30-day period if "the employee provide[d] appropriate documentation from the head of the rehabilitation program...." The provision establishes a substantive criteria governing the Agency's exercise of its right to determine its internal security practices in the same way as the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that Provision 2 directly interferes with management's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Provision 2 directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, it is negotiable if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union clearly intends Provision 2 as an arrangement to minimize the adverse effects of a decision by the Agency to test employees already enrolled in a rehabilitation program based on reasonable suspicion.&#x2003;As noted by the Union, agencies are required by the Executive Order to remove from the Federal service employees who test positive on a second drug test. Provision 2 would, among other things, provide employees with a 30-day period in which they would be exempt from both a second drug test, based on reasonable suspicion, and from dismissal based on a positive result on such test. Therefore, we conclude that Provision 2 constitutes an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the provision constitutes an arrangement, we now determine whether the provision is "appropriate" because it does not excessively interferes [sic] with management's rights. In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, we concluded that the disputed proposal excessively interfered with the agency's right to determine its internal security practices. We noted, in this regard, that the proposal negated the agency's right to determine whether any testing was warranted during the 60-day period to secure and safeguard the agency's property and personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach the same conclusion here.&#x2003;As noted previously, Provision 2 would provide employees with a period of at least 30 days during which they would not be subject to a drug test based on reasonable suspicion and, accordingly, would not be subject to dismissal based on a positive result on such test. This, in our view, is a significant benefit to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the impact on management's right, Provision 2 is unlike the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span> in at least two ways. First...Provision 2 would not affect the Agency's right to conduct other tests, including random or post-accident testing. Moreover, Provision 2 establishes a time period of at least 30 days during which reasonable suspicion testing would be prohibited, the disputed proposal in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span> established a 60-day time period. As such, the effect of Provision 2 on the Agency's right to determine its internal security <span id="page_824"></span>practices would appear to be somewhat less than that of the proposal in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 2 would, however, negate the Agency's right to conduct reasonable suspicion testing for a period of at least 30 days. Such testing, by the parties' agreement, is based on a supervisor's "suspicion of illegal drug use," concurred in by a management official designated by the head of the Agency.... Moreover, in the absence of an assertion to the contrary, we assume that the Agency's reasonable suspicion could not be based solely on the fact that an employee was participating in a rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prohibiting all testing based on reasonable suspicion for at least 30 days constitutes a severe restriction on the Agency's right to safeguard its property and personnel. In our view, the negative effect on the Agency's right to conduct reasonable suspicion testing resulting from Provision 2 outweighs the benefit to employees afforded by the provision. Therefore, we find that Provision 2 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and does not constitute an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 510-11 (1991), were two proposals preventing the agency from retesting individuals obtaining rehabilitative assistance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 53</span>. Employees who identify themselves as illegal drug users to the Employee Assistance Program may do so separate from this drug testing program and may seek appropriate rehabilitative assistance without being subject to additional drug testing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Proposal 54</span>. When an employee identifies himself/herself as an illegal drug user to the Employee Assistance Program separate from this drug testing program, that information shall be kept in strict confidence by the Employee Assistance Program. The employee will be given the opportunity to seek rehabilitative assistance without being placed in the follow-up pool for drug testing.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the bases for rejecting the negotiability of Proposals 53 and 54, 42 FLRA at 512-14:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5(b) of the Executive Order establishes procedures to be followed when an employee voluntarily admits to illegal drug usage. Such employee need not be disciplined if he or she obtains counseling or rehabilitation and, thereafter, refrains from using illegal drugs. <span class="Italic">See generally</span>, <span class="Italic">Mather AFB</span>, 40 FLRA at 872-73. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> FPM Letter 792-19, section 5.d. Neither the Executive Order nor FPM Letter 792-19 exempts employees who voluntarily admit to illegal drug usage from testing, however. Rather, section 3(c)(3) of the Executive Order provides that the head of an agency is "authorized" to test an employee "[a]s part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use through an Employee Assistance Program." Section 3.e of the FPM Letter, which explains section 3(c)(3) of the Executive Order, provides that the head of an agency "may also require agency-administered follow-up drug testing during or after counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Executive Order and the FPM Letter authorize drug testing as part of, or as a follow-up to, counseling and rehabilitation, they do not require such testing. Accordingly, although Proposals 53 and 54 would exempt employees, during and after rehabilitation, from any drug testing authorized by the Executive Order and the FPM Letter, the proposals are not inconsistent with law or Government-wide regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we find that Proposals 53 and 54 are nonnegotiable on a different ground. Proposals that prescribe substantive criteria governing the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute directly interfere with that right. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA at 1526. Management's right under section 7106(a)(1) to determine its internal security practices includes the right to conduct random drug tests.... Proposals 53 and 54 would exempt from drug testing any employee who voluntarily enters a rehabilitation program. Restricting in this manner management's ability to administer drug tests directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Proposals 53 and 54 directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, the proposals are negotiable if they constitute appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.... It is...necessary to determine whether the proposals excessively interfere with management's right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 53 would benefit admitted drug users who voluntarily submit to counseling and rehabilitation by insulating them from any additional drug testing.&#x2003;Proposal 54 would benefit admitted drug users who volunteer for counseling and rehabilitation by preventing follow-up testing. These are significant benefits as, among other things, Federal agencies are required, in various circumstances, by the Executive Order to discipline and/or remove from the Federal service employees who test positive on drug tests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, Proposal 53 would eliminate the Agency's discretion to determine whether any testing is warranted to secure and safeguard the Agency's property and employees. The proposal would bar testing even on the basis of reasonable suspicion that an employee is currently using illegal drugs or to ascertain whether an accident or unsafe practice is attributable to substance abuse. Similarly, Proposal 54 would prevent the Agency from testing admitted drug users to ascertain whether they have become, and remain, drug free. This blanket prohibition on testing excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. We conclude, therefore, that Proposals 53 and 54 do not constitute appropriate arrangements, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and are nonnegotiable.</p>
