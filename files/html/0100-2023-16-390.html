<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-389"><span class="space">b.</span> Notice Directly to Employees, Managers; Others</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Sch. and North Carolina Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 3 FLRA 364, 367-68 (1980), directed that notices be sent to all employees at their residences. The employees were on vacation and the posting at the employer's facilities served no purpose. At least until<span class="Italic"> DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FTC Oklahoma City and AFGE Local 171</span>, 67 FLRA 221 (2014), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, unless there are unusual circumstances, FLRA is not inclined to require that notice of a violation and a remedial cease and desist order be sent to individual supervisors and managers. <span class="Italic">F. E. Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 160-62 (1996), rejected a request by the General Counsel that the activity's commanding officer issue a memorandum to all supervisors and managers reminding them of their duty to notify the union before conducting formal discussions with unit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well settled that the Authority has a "broad range of remedial powers." <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, U.S. Army Commissary, Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, Indiana v. FLRA</span>, 56 F.3d 273, 277 (D.C. Cir. 1995) <span class="Italic">reversing</span> <span class="Italic">Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army, U.S. Army Soldier Support Center, Fort Benjamin</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison, Office of the Director of Finance and Accounting</span>, <span class="Italic">Indianapolis, Indiana</span>, 48 FLRA 6 (1993)). Section 7105(g)(3) of the Statute provides that, in addition to issuing traditional cease-and-desist orders, the Authority "may require an agency or a labor organization...to take any remedial action [the Authority] considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this chapter." Section 7118(a)(7)(D) similarly provides that the Authority may order an unfair labor practice respondent to take "such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter." The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has "more than once said that [sections 7105(g)(3) and 7118(a)(7)(D)] 'exude indications of a broad congressional delegation of discretion to the FLRA to fashion appropriate remedies for an unfair labor practice.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 277 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the same time, this "broad range of remedial powers" is not without limits. For example, the Authority may not issue a remedy requiring the expenditure of Government money absent an express waiver of sovereign immunity. In addition, remedies for unfair labor practices may not be punitive. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Prisons, Safford, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 445 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Safford</span>). The Authority also may not direct a respondent to perform an illegal act. <span class="Italic">E.g., Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth</span>, <span class="Italic">New Hampshire</span>, 49 FLRA 1522, 1532 (1994) (Authority will not order <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> where prior practice was unlawful).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within these limits, however, the Authority has defined the broad objectives that an unfair labor practice remedy should serve: "We believe that remedies for unfair labor practices under the Statute should, like those under the NLRA, be 'designed to recreate the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice.'" <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45 (quoting <span class="Italic">Local 60, United</span> <span class="Italic">Brotherhood of Carpenters &#x0026; Joiners v. NLRB</span>, 365 U.S. 651, 657 (1961) (Harlan, J., concurring)). Any such remedies must, of course, "effectuate the policies of the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 445. In addition, although the deterrence of future violative conduct is not in itself the principal objective of a remedial order, it "is also certainly a desirable effect of a remedy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has developed several "traditional" remedies, including a cease-and-desist order accompanied by the posting of a notice to employees, which are provided in virtually all cases where a violation is found. Other remedies requiring some form of affirmative action by the respondent have also become established, including, as examples, a retroactive bargaining order, the grant of back pay, and the release of improperly withheld information. In some cases, these remedies have given rise to criteria of their own. <span class="Italic">E.g., Federal Correctional Institution</span>, 8 FLRA 604 (1982) (setting criteria for <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedies where respondent failed to bargain over impact and implementation of a change); <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 41 FLRA 272, 279 (1991) (setting standard for <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy where respondent failed to bargain over substance of a change).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that nontraditional remedies, such as the memorandum proposed by the General Counsel in this case, must satisfy the same broad objectives that the Authority described in <span class="Italic">Safford</span>. That is, assuming that there exist no legal or public policy objections to a proposed, nontraditional remedy, the questions are whether the remedy is reasonably necessary and would be effective to "recreate the conditions and relationships" with which the unfair labor practice interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct<span class="Italic">. Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 444-45. These questions are essentially factual. As such, they should be argued and resolved in essentially the same fashion as other factual questions brought before us. As with other factual questions, the General Counsel bears the burden of persuasion, and the Judge is responsible for initially determining whether the remedy is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the General Counsel's sole argument as to why the Judge's recommended remedy is inadequate is that the Respondent's Chief of Employee and Labor Relations conducted the formal discussion with the boiler plant employees after having received the charge filed by the Union regarding the Rivet Mile meeting. According to the General Counsel, the proposed memorandum from the Respondent's commander is necessary to prevent future violations of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the charge regarding the Rivet Mile meeting was filed 1 month before the May 25 meeting, the Chief of Employee and Labor Relations was not notified until some 8 months later, when the consolidated complaint was issued, that those allegations were to be litigated. The Respondent has at all times denied the Local's allegations, and the General Counsel has presented no evidence, or even asserted, that the Respondent has conducted any other formal discussions in violation of the Statute besides the two discussions at issue here. Although the education of supervisors and managers about their responsibilities under the Statute is always a salutary objective, the General Counsel's argument that such education is necessary in this case is unsupported by the evidence. Given the facts of this case, the traditional remedy recommended by the Judge should also accomplish the objective of future deterrence, an objective that, as discussed above, is "a desirable effect of a remedy." As such, we conclude that the Judge's recommended remedy is appropriate to effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Phoenix and AFGE Local 2382</span>, 52 FLRA 182 (1996). <span class="Italic">US Penitentiary, Florence, and AFGE Local 1301</span>, 53 FLRA 1393, 1393-94 (1998), approved distribution of a remedial notice to all supervisors and managers because of respondent's repeated discriminatory statements to unit members:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge determined that the complaint was based on a timely filed charge and that the Respondent violated the Statute as alleged in the complaint.&#x2003;He ordered the Respondent to cease and desist from such conduct and to post a notice describing the violation. The Judge rejected the Union's request that the personnel file of the supervisor who committed the violations be annotated to state that his actions were found to violate the Statute. However, finding this case to be "the third violation involving statements by supervisors of the Respondent[,]" the Judge ordered the Respondent to distribute a copy of the notice to all of its supervisors and management officials, in addition to posting it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the General Counsel's request that the official file of the supervisor who committed the violations be annotated, we note that the Judge's order that the posted notice be distributed to all supervisors and management officials is a nontraditional remedy tailored to fit the circumstances of this case. Such remedies are ordered where "reasonably necessary and...effective to 'recreate the conditions and relationships' with which the ULP interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute, including the deterrence of future violative conduct." <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 161 (1996), <span class="Italic">citing U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons</span>, <span class="Italic">Safford, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 444-45 (1990). The distribution of the posting to all supervisors and managers ordered by the Judge sufficiently addresses the concern for deterrence raised by the General Counsel's request for an additional remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Rejected in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and AFGE Local 2640</span>, 54 FLRA 987, 1022-23 (1998), was the suggestion that the posting be read to all employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel also contends that the notice to employees should be signed by the Secretary of Commerce, the notice should be posted throughout NOAA, and the notice should be read to employees by a high ranking official. We find no reason to impose these nontraditional remedies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Judge's determination that the Assistant Administrator for the National Ocean Service should sign the notice accords with Authority practice. As the Judge found, the ULPs were limited to the National Ocean Service and it has not been shown that they reflect a broader departmental policy. The Authority "typically directs the posting of a notice signed by the highest official of the activity responsible for the violation." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Standiford</span> <span class="Italic">Air Traffic Control Tower, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 53 FLRA 312, 322 (1997). Similarly, because the violations occurred only at the Riverdale facility, limiting the posting to that facility is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the General Counsel provides no substantial reasons for granting its request that the notice be read to employees. The General Counsel states only that "such a remedy is clearly within the purview of the Authority to grant...and [the General Counsel] would welcome this particular remedy in this case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1663"></span>We do adopt certain nontraditional language in the posting as recommended by the Judge, specifically, the posting's reference to prior violations of the Statute. We believe that this language serves to put both employees and the Respondent on notice of the serious nature of the Respondent's unlawful conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent">But <span class="Italic">US Penitentiary, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 919</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 718-19 (1999), directed that the ULP notice be read to all employees either by the facility's warden, or by an FLRA agent in the presence of the warden, to remedy egregious threats against the union and its officials by the warden:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent, through the warden, engaged in a pattern of ULP violations over the course of a 7-month period. Some of those violations--e.g., making threatening, anti-Union statements at a mandatory meeting of all employees (unit and nonunit), making repeated statements threatening to take action against Union officials--were, in our view, egregious. In addition, the warden was personally involved to a significant extent in a majority of the Respondent's violations here....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the private sector, where a particular management official has had "pervasive personal involvement" in a series of ULPs and has committed a majority of the violations, the NLRB has issued orders providing the respondent with the option of either having that individual management official personally read the notice to all employees, which informs employees that the employer has been found to have committed statutory violations, or having an NLRB agent read the notice with the management official present. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Three Sisters Sportswear Co., </span>312 NLRB 853, 853 (1993). <span class="Italic">Cf. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Service Industries, </span>319 NLRB 231, 232 (1995) (providing the respondent with the option of either having the operations manager at each worksite read the notice, or having an NLRB agent read the notice with the operations manager present; the NLRB selected the operations manager not because he personally committed the ULPs, but "because the record indicates that the employees view him as the personification of the Company").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In view of the fact that the warden made egregious, anti-Union statements at a mandatory meeting of all employees, we find that it is reasonably necessary to require those statements to be retracted, via a reading aloud of the notice, at another meeting of all employees. This remedy will reach the same group of employees that witnessed the offense, and is calculated to have a countervailing impact similar to the initial offense. Further, because the warden called this mandatory meeting and made these statements in his representational capacity as the warden of the penitentiary, we find it reasonably necessary to require the warden to conduct the reading, or alternatively, to require the warden to be present when the reading is conducted by an Authority agent, in order to recreate the conditions and relationships with which the unfair labor practice interfered, as well as to effectuate the policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the GC's alternative requested remedy, we find that the Respondent has not explained why having an Authority agent read the notice (or having an Authority agent oversee the warden's reading of the notice) in these circumstances would be excessive, or would constitute an unwarranted intrusion into the Respondent's operation. Accordingly, we direct the Respondent, at the Union's request, to call a mandatory meeting of all employees (unit and nonunit), at which either the warden will read aloud the notice under supervision of an Authority agent, or an Authority agent will read aloud the notice with the warden present.</p>
<p class="noindent">An activity-wide distribution of a ULP notice was required for an egregious series of anti-union statements by the warden of a facility in <span class="Italic">US Penitentiary, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 919</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 720 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously declined to name, in a notice, an individual supervisor or manager whose actions are the basis for a finding that an agency has committed a ULP. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 51 FLRA 914 (1996). Additionally, the Authority has noted that there are no private sector cases where such a remedy has been granted. <span class="Italic">See Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, </span>52 FLRA 182, 185 n.5 (1996). Consistent with our discussion in the previous section of this decision, and in view of the other remedies we grant in this case, we conclude that naming particular individuals in the notice is not reasonably necessary in order to recreate the conditions and relationships with which the unfair labor practice interfered, or to effectuate the policies of the Statute. Accordingly, consistent with the foregoing precedent, we decline to grant this requested extraordinary remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where distributing a notice is reasonably necessary to notify employees that a respondent has violated the Statute, the Authority has granted a remedy requiring that the notice be distributed to all employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Fort Bragg Schools, </span>3 FLRA 364 (1980). <span class="Italic">But cf. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,</span> 45 FLRA 1090 (1992), enforcement denied as to other matters, No. 92-2347 (4th Cir. Apr. 19, 1993) (where distributing the notice was not reasonably necessary to notify employees that the respondent has violated the Statute, the Authority has declined to grant a remedy similar to the one requested here).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unfair labor practices in Case Nos.&#x2003;DE-CA-60051 and DE-CA-60569 consisted of anti-Union statements at mandatory meetings of all employees, including all bargaining unit employees. Because an unusually large number of employees directly witnessed these egregious violations, we find that additional measures should be taken to ensure that the remedial information reaches all of the employees and to demonstrate to employees that their rights will be protected. Accordingly, we direct the Respondent to distribute copies of the notice to all employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the record does not demonstrate why it is necessary to distribute copies of the order, or to post the order alongside the notice. A notice to all employees is designed to inform employees that the Authority has found that the agency has violated the Statute. It is not apparent that the order is in any way more informative than, or conveys any information different from, the notice. Accordingly, we decline to direct the Respondent to distribute copies of the order, or to post the order alongside the notice. We do, however, modify the standard wording of the notice to make clearer that the Respondent has been found to have acted unlawfully.</p>
