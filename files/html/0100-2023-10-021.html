<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 60 FLRA 57, 61-62 (2004), determining that a lead technical controller was not a supervisor, reviewed the characteristics of a nonsupervisory work leader:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(10) defines a supervisor as an individual having authority to "hire, direct, assign, promote, reward...suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances...if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment...." The Authority has held that an employee will be considered a supervisor if the employee "consistently exercises independent judgment with regard to the supervisory indicia set forth" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). <span class="Italic">National Mediation Bd.</span>, 56 FLRA at 1, 7-8 (2000) (<span class="Italic">NMB</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exch. Serv., Base Exch. Fort Carson, Fort Carson, Colo.</span>, 3 FLRA 596, 599 (1980)). "[A]n employee need exercise only one of the responsibilities set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) in conjunction with independent judgment in order to be found a supervisor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8. In addition, the Authority has determined that if an employee's actions in connection with one of the supervisory indicia are of a routine nature, entailing the exercise of very little independent judgment or no consistent exercise of discretion, the employee will not be considered a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NMB</span>, 56 FLRA at 8; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 32 FLRA 1255, 1259 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, in determining whether an employee is a supervisor, has distinguished employees who are considered "leaders." The Authority has concluded that an employee will be considered a "leader," and not a supervisor, if the employee's responsibilities are routine in nature and do not consistently involve the exercise of independent judgment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NMB</span>, 56 FLRA at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Army Aviation Sys. Command and Army Troop Support Command, St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 36 FLRA 587 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record and Authority precedent, we find no basis to conclude that the RD failed to apply established law. Although the LTC may be involved in recommending awards, this does not support a finding that the LTC is a supervisor because the record indicates that any employee can recommend another employee for an award. The record illustrates that the LTC attends management conference calls, but the RD found and the Agency does not dispute that he does so for his technical expertise. The LTC does not sign leave slips, even when he is in the role of acting manager. Although the LTC appears to assign overtime, the LTC's role does not require an exercise of independent judgment because the overtime is done on a voluntary rotational basis and must be approved by the ROCC supervisor. The LTC may distribute technical work assignments, but the evidence illustrates that the ROCC supervisor assigns the tasks to the LTC and the LTC distributes the tasks according to the supervisor's directions as well as who is available for which task.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the LTC may provide input and recommendations concerning promotions, employee evaluations and discipline, the recommendations are only one factor and may not be followed. In fact, the testimony suggests that hiring, promotion and discipline determinations are made at the division level, by second-level supervisors and managers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the record indicates that the LTC has the authority to take any actions that constitute the supervisory indicia in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). The LTC's role is more akin to that of a "leader," where the responsibilities are routine in nature and do not require consistent exercise of independent judgment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NMB</span>, 56 FLRA at 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the record and consistent with Authority precedent, the Agency has not established that the LTC is a supervisor within the statutory definition.</p>
<p class="noindent">Work leaders were not supervisors when they worked as leadmen or more senior and experienced employees <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> junior and less experienced employees. They had none of the usual indicia of supervisory authority. They took instructions from their supervisors, passing them along to other employees on the job, drew and distributed equipment and tasks to the other employees, working alongside the other employees, and reported work progress to the supervisors. Their job titles included electrical mechanical leader, grounds maintenance leader, carpenter leader, cement finisher leader, air conditioning equipment mechanical leader, pest controller leader, and maintenance fuel distribution systems leader. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, U.S. Naval Station, Panama and AFSCME Local 907</span>, 7 FLRA 489, 491-92 (1981). A team leader was not a supervisor who had routine responsibility for assigning and directing work of a subordinate. His relation to the subordinate was that of a senior employee to a junior, so that as equal members of the team they discussed each task to be done and planned a course of action. <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE Local 34</span>, 10 FLRA 682, 683 (1982). Employees were not supervisors or managers who, as team leaders, routinely assigned work and became involved in the clerical aspects of leave administration and performance evaluation, but who exercised no consistent independent judgment. Those unit employees included a maintenance management officer, operations research analyst, maintenance management specialist, supply systems analyst, and general engineers at the GS-13 level. <span class="Italic">DARCOM Materiel Readiness Support Activity and AFGE Local 894</span>, 8 FLRA 46, 50-53 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">Some team leaders may be supervisors, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Aviation Sys. Command and NFFE Local 405</span>, 36 FLRA 587, 592-93 (1990), determining several leaders to be supervisors because their work involved independent judgment requiring assessment of both the technical nature of the work assigned to team members and the expertise and qualifications of team members for assignments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has found that employees who consistently exercise independent judgment in the assignment of work, as distinguished from performing duties that are only routine in nature, are supervisors. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command</span>, 16 FLRA <span id="Page_32"></span>248 (1984); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station</span>, 7 FLRA 526, 529-31 (1981); and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Lewisburg</span>, 7 FLRA 126, 132-33 (1981). Additionally, the Authority has found employees to be supervisors where it was shown that they consistently exercise independent judgment as to the direction or review of other employees' work. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>; <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations</span>, 4 FLRA 644, 651-52 (1980); <span class="Italic">Army and Air Force Exchange Service</span>, 3 FLRA at 601.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Aviation Sys. Command</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was applied in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, WAPA and AFGE</span>, 60 FLRA 6, 8-9 (2004), concluding that a team leader functioned as a supervisor when he evaluated the abilities of team members to determine work assignments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, the Authority addressed the supervisory status of several team leaders in Electronics Engineer positions. Generally, in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, with respect to all five of the supervisory team leaders, the Authority found that these team leaders consistently exercised independent judgment in assigning work that was not routine in nature where the team leaders considered a number of determinative factors such as the priority of assignments, the competence or capability of team members, the expertise and experience of team members, the equity of workload distribution, and the availability of team members. As relevant here, the Authority found that the assignment and reassignment of work by Electronics Engineer team leader Rai was not routine and involved the consistent exercise of independent judgment where the team leader consistently assigned work based on "his discretion as to the nature of the work and the experience of the team members[,]" and reassigned work among team members once a month or every two months based on a reassessment of the workload and new priorities. <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, 36 FLRA at 594. Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, the Authority found that the two team leaders who assigned work based solely on the type of equipment, project or system with which the work was associated, and normally did not reassign or shift initial work assignments, did not consistently exercise independent judgment in assigning work and were not supervisors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 596-97.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the RD failed to apply established law as set forth in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> in assessing whether Neu consistently exercises independent judgment in the assignment of work, as distinguished from assigning work in a routine fashion. We find that unlike the non-supervisory team leaders in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> who assigned work to members based solely on one criterion such as the type of work, Neu considers a number of determinative factors such as the team members' expertise in a particular area, as well as workload availability and work priorities in assigning work. Like the team leader Rai in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, we find that the record evidence in this case sufficiently demonstrates that Neu consistently exercises independent judgment in considering such factors as the team members' experience and expertise, as well as workload availability and work priorities. In this respect, we note that Neu agreed with the hearing officer's assessment at one point in his testimony that 80 percent of the time assignments are made in an "automatic" manner based on a team member's expertise "without particularly any other considerations[.]" However, Neu clarified, at that same point in his testimony, as well as throughout his entire testimony, that in assigning all work he independently or consciously considers the team members' expertise, their availability and workload priorities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the testimony of Neu's supervisor demonstrates that Neu considers and weighs the expertise of team members, their availability, work priorities and employee development when he assigns work. Moreover, review of Neu's complex spreadsheet of all the major projects handled by the group, which reflects the projected deadlines for completion, the levels of workload priority, the percentage of the project that has been completed to date and the respective team members assigned to specific projects, further supports the testimony noted above that Neu considers the team members' expertise, their availability and workload priorities in assigning these projects. Also, we note that Neu's testimony that in response to his supervisor's request, he met with the engineers from his group and ensured that someone in the group would work on Fridays, which had been the group's day off, provides further support that Neu assigns work in a non-routine fashion as a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the RD's primary reliance on the fact that 80 to 90 percent of the projects were within the team members' particular expertise is misplaced under established precedent such as <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> in assessing whether Neu consistently exercised independent judgment in assigning work. In this respect, the fact that Neu ultimately assigns 80 to 90 percent of the projects to members in their area of expertise does not negate the fact that Neu engages in an independent evaluative process prior to assigning the work by considering the team members' expertise and experience, the availability of members and the priority of the projects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that the RD's assessment of Neu's reassignment of work is not consistent with <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>. In this respect, Neu's record testimony, which is undisputed, establishes that he reassigns projects five to six times for the year based on workload and priority considerations. Here, given the fact that Neu assigns only 30 to 35 major projects per year, we find that five to six reassignments (approximately 15 to 25 percent of the projects) based on workload and priority concerns is not "minimal" as the RD concluded. In this respect, we find that Neu's level of reassigning projects is analogous to that of the supervisory team leader Rai in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command,</span> who reassigned work once a month or every two months, and is inconsistent with that of the non-supervisory team leaders in that case who normally did not reassign work. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 853 (2004) (Authority found that the employee in dispute was analogous to non-supervisory leaders in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> given employee's testimony that he assigned work to employees who did that particular work on a routine basis and that he did not reassign or change work priorities).</p>
