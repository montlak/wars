<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-3"><span class="space">A.</span> TIME LIMIT FOR RECONSIDERATION REQUEST</h3>
<p class="noindent">The time limit for reconsideration requests is strictly construed. FLRA regulations permit 10 days. 5 CFR 2429.17 (2022). Those 10 days are counted from the date of service of FLRA's final decision, not from the date of receipt of the final decision or order. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 38 FLRA 1527, 1530 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Maritime MTC</span>, 50 FLRA 103, 103 (1995) ("The time limit for filing a motion for reconsideration of the Authority's Decision is 10 days after the date the Decision was served on the filing party. The date of service of the Decision is the date it was issued and deposited in the U.S. mail. Because the Decision was served by mail, 5 days are added to the period for filing a motion for reconsideration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.22"); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Phoenix Dist. and NTEU Chap. 33</span>, 44 FLRA 74, 76 (1992) (restating rules governing calculation of filing date fro reconsideration petition); 5 CFR 2429.27(d) (2022). Added to that period is an allowance of five days for filing when a party is served by mail with FLRA determination leading to the reconsideration request. <span class="Italic">Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr. and AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 916</span>, 32 FLRA 663, 663-64 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Mediation Bd. and AFGE</span>, 56 FLRA 320, 322 (2000) (considering service by mail rule and intervening weekends and federal holidays); <span class="Italic">IRS, Indianapolis and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 32 FLRA 1235, 1236 (1988) (restating rules governing filing by mail and in person; denying request for waiver of time limit because extraordinary circumstances were not shown); <span class="Italic">cf. DODDES and Antilles Consol. Ed. Assn.,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-143.html">72 FLRA 720</a> (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring; Member Abbott dissenting) (applying reconsideration regulation and time limit to union request for reconsideration of a ULP bargaining order); 5 CFR 2429.21, 2429.22 (2022).</p>
<p class="noindent">The last day of the period computed is to be included unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday; the time period for filing is then advanced to the next workday. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation and IBEW Locals 2159 and 1759</span>, 46 FLRA 1202, 1203 (1993); 5 CFR 2429.21 (2022). Compelling circumstances, e.g., medical emergencies that prevent representatives or parties from receiving FLRA decisions, have led FLRA to grant a waiver of the time limit governing reconsideration requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS and AFGE Local 476</span>, 32 FLRA 1261, 1264 (1988). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, New York Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 29 FLRA 39, 40 (1987) (ordinary delays in mail delivery do not constitute extraordinary circumstances for waiving expired time limit). If reconsideration is based on the issuance of what is arguably a new controlling court decision, FLRA will permit the reconsideration petition to be filed within a "reasonable period of time after issuance of the court's decision." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 49 FLRA 171, 175 n.5 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent">Untimely reconsideration requests will not be considered without the application by FLRA of 5 CFR 2429.23(b) (2022), providing that it may waive expired time limits in "extraordinary circumstances." Generally those circumstances are not found. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Kansas City and AFGE Local 2663</span>, 52 FLRA 282, 284 (1996). An untimely filing resulting in the dismissal of a negotiability appeal was not excused by office staffing problems, the pressure of other work commitments, inadvertent misfiling, lack of awareness of time limits, or lack of familiarity with FLRA regulations. Those circumstances, separately and collectively, did not constitute extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">Wyoming Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Sheridan</span>, 10 FLRA 689, 690 (1982); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2113 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Warfare Training Sys.

<p class="noindent">Extraordinary circumstances were not demonstrated when an attorney responsible for a case was out of the office on training when the reconsideration petition needed to be filed. <span class="Italic">IRS, Indianapolis and NTEU Chap. 49,</span> 32 FLRA 1235, 1236 (1988); <span class="Italic">see AFGE Local 2338 and VAMC Poplar Bluff,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-36.html">72 FLRA 176</a>, 177 (2021) (Member Abbott dissenting) ("Moreover, although the Union's attorney states that, during his illness, he 'had no one in in his office' to collect his mail during the filing deadline, the Union does not explain why it did not make arrangements for monitoring the Union's mail in his absence.

But we are constrained by our precedent to conclude that the Union has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances warranting the waiver of the regulatory filing deadline for the Union's motion."); <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3870 and USDA, Farmers Home Admin., Washington</span>, 50 FLRA 445, 447 (1995) (denying reconsideration of dismissal of negotiability petition following failure to correct defective service; illness of counsel was not shown to have precluded someone else in counsel's office from reviewing FLRA order and responding to deficiency notice); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Fin. and Accounting Ctr., Indianapolis and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 40 FLRA 233, 235 (1991) (union president received decision, union did not show absence of its counsel prevented it from receiving decision or timely filing for reconsideration).</p>
<p class="noindent">A belated reconsideration request was not granted based on the union's internal difficulties involving control of internal mail, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1102 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Sea-Tac</span>, 63 FLRA 343, 343-44 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that it did not respond to the Authority's Order to Show Cause in a timely manner because the Agency's mail room, which the Union uses, had a policy which impeded the Union's receipt of certified letters from the Authority and the Agency. Specifically, according to the Union, the Agency would not allow the Union's newly elected president to open certified letters that were addressed to the union's past president.<span class="Italic"> </span>Also according to the Union, the past president did not open the Authority's Order because he was out of town and, when the past president returned, the mail room was closed for two weeks because of a staff shortage arising from an annual training program at the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Agency's mail room is unreliable. In this regard, the Union claims that although it requested confirmation of the Authority's receipt of its exception, it has not received any such confirmation from the mail room.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.17 of the Authority's Regulations permits a party that can establish extraordinary circumstances to request reconsideration of an Authority decision. The Authority has repeatedly recognized that a party seeking reconsideration of an Authority decision under &#x00A7; 2429.17 bears the heavy burden of establishing that extraordinary circumstances exist to justify this unusual action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Wash., D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 935 (2000) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). The Authority has identified a limited number of situations in which extraordinary circumstances have been found to exist. These include situations: (1) where an intervening court decision or change in the law affected dispositive issues; (2) where evidence, information, or issues crucial to the decision had not been presented to the Authority; (3) where the Authority erred in its remedial order, process, conclusion of law, or factual finding; and (4) where the moving party has not been given an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Authority in the decision. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, 375th Combat Support Group, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.,</span> 50 FLRA 84, 85-87 (1995). The Authority has repeatedly advised that attempts to relitigate conclusions reached by the Authority are insufficient to establish extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">See IRS, </span>56 FLRA at 936.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-settled that untimely filings caused by delays or problems with internal mail systems, like those claimed by the Union, do not present extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2113, </span>55 FLRA 414, 415 (1999). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots,</span> 49 FLRA 1370, 1371 (1994) (delay caused by internal mail system does not constitute extraordinary circumstance warranting consideration of exceptions to award that was not timely filed); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv. and United States Customs Serv. Region IX, Chicago, Ill.,</span> 34 FLRA 76, 78 (1989) (failure of union's mailing procedures is not extraordinary circumstance warranting reconsideration of Authority order dismissing union's exceptions to judge's decision as untimely filed). This includes situations where a union uses an agency's internal mail system.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2015,</span> 53 FLRA 967 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the fact that the new Union president could not open letters addressed to its past president because he was out of town at a conference does not establish extraordinary circumstances. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3438, </span>49 FLRA 1145, 1147 (1994). This is because, as the Authority has stated, "the representative could have made arrangements for the receipt of certified mail." <span class="Italic">Id. Compare Internal Revenue Serv., Indianapolis District, </span>32 FLRA 1235 (1988) (Authority found no extraordinary circumstances to waive expired time limit for filing request for reconsideration simply because attorney responsible for case was in training out of state) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., </span>32 FLRA 1261 (1988) (Authority waived expired time limit for filing motion for reconsideration where union representative on whom Authority decision was served was out of town attending to a family medical matter and the motion was filed within a reasonable amount of time after the representative became aware of the Authority's decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Union's arguments do not provide a basis for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Bureau of Prisons, FCC Miami and AFGE Local 3690,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-36.html">73 FLRA 154</a> (2022) (when the agency proved that the Postal Service delivered a response to a show cause order involving arbitration exceptions to the wrong address, FLRA granted a reconsideration motion concerning a procedural dismissal; still dismissing the exceptions).</p>
<p class="noindent">An opinion from the General Accounting Office did not excuse an untimely reconsideration request in <span class="Italic">GPO and Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Ass'n Local 100</span>, 59 FLRA 273, 274-76 (2003), deciding that the GAO opinion was not determinative and the lapse in time in seeking reconsideration was too great for FLRA to overlook:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.23(b) provides, in pertinent part, that the Authority "may waive any expired time limit...in extraordinary circumstances." The Agency contends that extraordinary circumstances for waiving the time limit for filing a request for reconsideration are present here because: the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span> renders erroneous the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Printing Office; </span>and the Agency filed its motion within a reasonable period after receiving the <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span> decision. For the following reasons, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances that warrant waiving the expired time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, although Comptroller General decisions possess "precedential value," they are not binding on the Authority<span class="Italic">. NAGE, Local R5-136</span>, 57 FLRA 220, 222 n.7 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3231</span>, 25 FLRA 600 (1987)). Thus, even assuming that the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span> conflicts with the Authority's legal conclusion in <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>, we are not required to follow <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">Printing Office </span>that was challenged in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span>--that <span class="Italic">GPO </span>is no longer viable precedent--was not central to either of the Authority's alternative holdings in <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>. In this regard, the Authority's first, alternative holding, that &#x00A7; 5544 does not establish the basic rate of pay, was based on an interpretation of the wording of &#x00A7; 5544, not on <span class="Italic">GPO</span>. In this regard, the Authority made the disputed statement regarding <span class="Italic">GPO </span>only <span class="Italic">after</span> concluding that &#x00A7; 5544 does not establish the basic rate of pay<span class="Italic">. See </span>57 FLRA at 301-02. The Authority's second, alternative holding--that, even assuming &#x00A7; 5544 specifies the calculation of basic rates of pay, reading &#x00A7; 5544 as setting both the overtime and basic rates of pay would render meaningless the bargaining rights set forth in &#x00A7; 305(a)--did not even mention <span class="Italic">GPO. See id</span>. at 302. Because the Authority's challenged statement was not central to either of the Authority's alternative holdings in <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>, the allegation that the statement was in error can provide no basis for reversing <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, permitting the Agency to file its motion nearly two years after the Authority issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Printing Office </span>would conflict with Congress' preference for final and binding arbitration<span class="Italic">. Cf. AFGE, Local 507</span>, 58 FLRA 378, 380 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (citing <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 66 (D.C. Cir. 1987), and discussing "Congress' intent that arbitration awards be final"). Consistent with this preference, the Authority does not review arbitration awards on the basis of evidence that comes into existence after arbitration because such evidence "is not a sufficient ground for 'vitiating the required finality of the original award[,]'" even if the evidence might result in a different award<span class="Italic">. AFGE</span>, Local 2004, 55 FLRA 6, 9 (1998) (citation omitted). The principle favoring finality in arbitration supports a conclusion that we should not waive the expired time limit after such a significant time has passed. In this regard, waiving the time limit would encourage parties to file motions for reconsideration many years after the Authority has issued a decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency relies on <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>, 49 FLRA at 175, where the Authority found that extraordinary circumstances warranted waiving an expired time limit because: (1) an intervening court decision rendered incorrect the Authority's previous decision; and (2) the moving party filed the request for reconsideration within a reasonable period after the court decision issued<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. However, <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs </span>is distinguishable from the instant case. In this connection, <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs </span>involved an intervening court decision, not a Comptroller General decision. More importantly, <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs </span>was an unfair labor practice case involving an outstanding Authority order, subject to direct judicial enforcement under &#x00A7; 7123 of the Statute, directing that the respondent take certain <span id="page_2501"></span>actions and cease and desist from other actions; the instant case does not involve such an order<span class="Italic">. See IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1091, 1108 (1993) ("the Authority's decision in an unfair labor practice proceeding is subject to direct judicial enforcement under section 7123(b) while an arbitrator's decision is subject to enforcement only if an unfair labor practice charge is filed for failure to comply with the award").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency did not request the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span> until more than two months after the Authority issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>. In this connection, the Authority issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Printing Office </span>on June 26, 2001, and the Agency did not seek guidance from the Comptroller General until September 13, 2001. Moreover, the Agency did not file its motion for reconsideration within ten days of receiving the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span>. Section 2429.17 does not address how many days a party has to file a motion for reconsideration after issuance of a decision by a body other than the Authority. Nevertheless, we find that the Agency's failure to request the Comptroller General's guidance promptly after the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Printing Office</span>--and its failure to file its motion for reconsideration within ten days of receiving the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">Calculating Overtime Pay</span>--supports a conclusion that we should not waive the expired deadline here.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's regulation permitting parties to file "other documents" is not a basis to bypass the limitations on the filing of reconsideration requests, <span class="Italic">DHS Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement and AFGE Local 222,</span> 64 FLRA 908, 910 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's reliance on &#x00A7; 2429.26(a) of the Authority's Regulations, as stated previously, that regulation provides that the Authority may, in its discretion, grant leave to file "other documents" as deemed appropriate. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cong. Research Employees Ass'n, IFPTE, Local 75</span>, 59 FLRA 994, 999 (2004). Under that regulation, the filing party must demonstrate why its submission should be considered. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 98</span>, 60 FLRA 448, 448 n.2 (2004). However, both the wording of &#x00A7; 2429.26(a) and the aforementioned decisions indicate that this provision permits parties to file <span class="Italic">other </span>documents, and not <span class="Italic">any </span>documents. Put simply, &#x00A7; 2429.26 applies only to documents other than recognized filings; it does not apply in lieu of the requirements for those recognized filings. In this regard, if the Agency were correct, then a party that failed to comply with an applicable time limit in the Authority's Regulations could simply request a "document review" of the untimely filing under &#x00A7; 2429.26(a). This approach would render meaningless the Authority's filing deadlines.</p>
