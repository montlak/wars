<h3 class="h3" id="sec11-3"><span class="space">A.</span> HARMFUL ERROR DEFINED</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Adverse actions and other cases subject to Board appeal are sufficiently complex, involving the efforts of so many people, some more skilled in legal niceties than others, that close inspection will likely disclose some error in the process. Agencies are expected to conform to the regulatory procedures they adopt, <span class="Italic">Dewberry v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 132, 134 (1986), and <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 688, 693 (1997), but civil service law does not mandate reversal of every action involving a regulatory or procedural error. The question of how much error is sufficient to invalidate an action against an employee is the subject of harmful error. The term itself is taken from the Reform Act, 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), providing: "[T]he agency's decision may not be sustained...if the employee...shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." The burden of proof is on the appellant, <span class="Italic">Allred v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-13-3062-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency error is harmful only where the record shows that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). The Board may not assume that an employee has been harmed by a procedural error in the adverse action process; rather, the appellant bears the burden of proving harm. <span class="Italic">Pumphrey v. Department of Defense</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6; 10 (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's apparent contention that she would have been exempted absent the agency's error is at best speculative, and the Board has held that such speculation does not constitute harm....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow apply the rule in a variety of contexts. Consult the other chapters of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> concerning adverse actions, performance cases, substantive offenses, RIFs, and discrimination cases for more decisions discussing harmful error. [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-031.html#sec17-31">Issues of Law, Jurisdiction; Constitutional Issues</a>" for standards guiding judicial review of Board decisions challenged as contrary to law; refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-065.html#sec10-66">Impact of Error</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-17-103.html#sec10-104">Substantive Rights, Harmful Error</a>" for the significance of procedural and substantive errors in the reduction in force process.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it has been remarked that the harmful error rule incorporated into the Reform Act was a revision of earlier law (that supposedly permitted the invalidation of removals for minor technical procedural defects), many earlier decisions essentially concluded that removals could be invalidated only if a procedural violation was substantial and prejudicial. E.g., <span class="Italic">Joyce v. United States</span>, 2 Ct. Cl. 226, 228 (1983); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 278 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Cruz-Casado v. United States</span>, 553 F.2d 672, 675 (Ct. Cl. 1977); <span class="Italic">Pascal v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 1284 (Ct. Cl. 1976); <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. United States</span>, 543 F.2d 134 (Ct. Cl. 1976); <span class="Italic">Bray v. United States</span>, 515 F.2d 1383 (Ct. Cl. 1975); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. United States</span>, 175 Ct. Cl. 690 (1966); <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, 354 U.S. 363 (1957). Nevertheless, the intent of Congress was to reduce the impact of procedural requirements, and the result is reluctance by the Board to overturn agency decisions on the basis of procedural violations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blackford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 712, 713 (1981) (harmful error language was adopted to avoid the reversal of agency actions because of technical procedural oversights resulting in no substantial prejudice to, or impairment of, an employee's rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The harmful error rule is statutorily-based. The statute governing Board adjudication, 5 USC 7701(c)(1), states that the Board will sustain an agency action proved by preponderant evidence, but:</p>

Neither party has submitted a copy of the rules or regulations governing the agency's DRB, and so it is impossible to know whether the agency's decision to close the appellant's DRB appeal violated the rules of the DRB program or was, in fact, consistent with those rules. Because there is no evidence establishing what procedure the agency allegedly violated, we find that the appellant failed to show that the agency committed procedural error. Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of harmful error."). Allegations of harmful error should first be addressed to the AJ. The Board will not consider an allegation of harmful procedural error raised for the first time in a PFR unless there is new and material evidence. <span class="Italic">Kline v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's harmful error interpretation is generally judicially accepted: for there to be harmful error warranting reversal of a Board decision, the error must substantially impair an employee's rights. <span class="Italic">Dorrance v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 516 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In administrative disciplinary proceedings, if a removal is based on substantial evidence and conforms to the law, technical deviations from procedures do not invalidate the action if there is no prejudice shown. <span class="Italic">Boylan v. USPS</span>, 704 F.2d 573 (11th Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court reviewed the Board's harmful error test in a case that originated in arbitration, <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 105 S. Ct. 2882 (1985). The Court's discussion of the harmful error provision of the Reform Act suggested that because the provision is to benefit the employer, a construction is not favored that provides particular benefit to an employee who identifies nonprejudicial procedural error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act does not define the term "harmful error,"[9] and the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) is inconclusive.[10] The Act provides, however, that the Board "may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of [&#x00A7; 7701]," the provision in which the harmful-error rule appears. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7701(j). Pursuant to this authority, the Board has promulgated a definition of "harmful error":</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;It would be natural, however, to assume that Congress intended the term "harmful error" in &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) to have the same meaning that it has in the judicial context, that is, error that has some likelihood of affecting the result of the proceeding<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States v. Hasting</span>, 461 U.S. 499, 507-509, 103 S. Ct. 1974, 1979-1980, 76 L.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The original Senate version of the bill that became the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided that "agency action shall be upheld by Board, the administrative law judge, or the appeals officer unless--(A) the agency's procedures contained error that substantially impaired the rights of the employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 224 (1978); <span class="Italic">see</span> also<span class="Italic"> id.,</span> at 179.

See also id.</span>, at 54, 64. The Senate Report does not refer directly to the application of the harmful-error rule in an arbitration. The Report, however, does state that in "the negotiated grievance procedure an arbitrator must apply the same standards in deciding the case as would be applied...if the case had been appealed through the appellate procedures of 5 U.S.C. section 7701." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 111. Thus, it is clear that the Senate version of the harmful-error rule focused on the rights of the employee and did not suggest affirmatively that the Board or an arbitrator could take into account the rights of the union. The Conference Committee did not adopt the Senate version. Petitioner points out that the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference, which explained "the effect of the major actions agreed upon by the managers" of the two bodies, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, p. 127 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 78, p. 2860, did not note that any substantive change in meaning was intended by the change in language. We decline, however, to infer congressional intent to adopt the substance of the Senate version solely on the basis of this legislative silence.</p>

Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 M.S.P.B. 489, 493, 1 M.S.P.R. 505, 513 (1980), the Board explained: "Unless it is likely that an alleged error affected the result, its occurrence cannot have been prejudicial....&#8197;Stated another way, the question is whether it was within the range of appreciable probability that the error had a harmful effect upon the outcome before the agency." <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Davies v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's "procedures" considered by the Board in applying &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) include not only procedures required by statute, rule, or regulation,[12] but also procedures required by a collective-bargaining agreement between the agency and a union.[13] Thus, in an appeal of an agency disciplinary decision to the Board, the agency's failure to follow bargained-for procedures may result in its action's being overturned, but only if the failure might have affected the result of the agency's decision to take the disciplinary action against the individual employee. At least insofar as it applies to proceedings before the Board, this interpretation of the harmful-error rule is entitled to substantial deference.[14] <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]ne of the major purposes of the Act was to "preserv[e] the ability of federal managers to maintain 'an effective and efficient Government.'"...&#8197;In order to achieve this purpose, one of the "central tasks" of the Act was to "[a]llow civil servants to be able to be hired and fired more easily, but for the right reasons."...&#8197;In particular, the provisions of 7701 of the Act, including the harmful-error rule, were intended "to give agencies greater ability to remove or discipline expeditiously employees who engage in misconduct, or whose work performance is unacceptable."...&#8197;In the present case, the grievants concededly committed improper acts that justified their removal from the federal service. Although the agency committed procedural errors, those errors do not cast doubt upon the reliability of the agency's factfinding or decision.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the Board's disregard of the evaluation was not reversible error. As an appellate court, we are obligated to apply the rule of harmless error, examining the record "without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2111. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shinseki v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next challenges the administrative judge's finding that he failed to establish harmful procedural error by the agency because, in large part, he did not identify any procedures that the agency erroneously applied. Specifically, the appellant refers to the "STRL [Science and Technology Reinvention Lab] supervisor's objectives" which include fostering values such as "fairness, equity, respect, inclusion, and open communication." The appellant argues that these objectives are "good enough" to constitute a law or procedure that the agency violated. Although these objectives were set forth below in the agency's response to the appellant's interrogatories, the administrative judge did not consider them in connection with the appellant's harmful error claim. However, the appellant has not shown that the objectives constituted an agency procedure, either statutory, regulatory, or part of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Stephen v.
