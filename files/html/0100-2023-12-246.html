<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-245"><span class="space">a.</span> OSC Disciplinary Case</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The law governing stays sought by individuals was summarized in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 52 MSPR 375, 377 (1992), involving an individual's unsuccessful attempt to obtain a stay pending the outcome of a Federal Circuit appeal from a Board decision that he engaged in a prohibited personnel practice, coupled with a 30-day suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its discretion, the Board may stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review. 5 USC &#x00A7; 705; <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 268, 1 MSPR 280 (1979). Whether such a stay is issued, however, depends on an analysis of four factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Likelihood of success on appeal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Irreparable harm;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Substantial harm to other interested parties; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;The public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In each case the Board balances the likelihood of success on appeal with the three other factors. In those cases where the last three factors strongly favor the issuance of a stay, a stay will be issued if a serious legal question exists on the merits. If support for a stay by the last three factors is slight, a stay will be issued only if the possibility for success on appeal is strong.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered a request for a stay by a party in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 25 MSPR 514, 517 (1984). The case involved the demotion of an SES employee as a result of a prohibited personnel practice prosecution by OSC. The employee requested that the Board stay the personnel action until the Board's <span id="Page_1820"></span>ruling could be reviewed in court. The Board declined: there was no irreparable harm resulting from an adverse action and the public interest would not be advanced by a stay in an appeal involving a prohibited personnel practice. In a different appeal, the Board concluded that a stay will not be granted on the basis of financial hardship to an employee. Loss of salary is common in personnel cases and the harm is not irreparable. Nor is interruption of workload sufficient for a stay if the agency has made alternate plans for disposition of the work. A similar result was reached in a prohibited personnel practice case involving a fine against the respondent. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 425, 426 (1985) (declining to stay order that respondent pay a $1,000 fine).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Lee</span>, 114 MSPR 393, 394-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 2010 MSPB 137 (2010), involving a prohibited personnel practice and a disciplinary penalty, noted as to a stay application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may exercise its discretion to stay the enforcement of a final decision pending judicial review. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Campbell,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 455 (1993); <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 280 (1979). In determining whether to grant a stay, the Board evaluates four criteria: (1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he or she is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) whether the issuance of the stay will substantially harm the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 649, 651 (1994). The Board balances the likelihood of success on appeal with the last three criteria. If the stay applicant convincingly argues that the last three criteria are met, we will grant a stay if a serious legal question exists on the merits. If support for a stay on the basis of the last three criteria is slight, we will issue a stay if there is a strong possibility of success on appeal. However, the Board will not address the first criterion if the applicant fails to demonstrate any support for a stay based on the last three criteria. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 490, &#x00B6; 2 (2000); <span class="Italic">Andrada v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 117, 119 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the respondent's motion for a stay is based entirely on the argument concerning the merits of her appeal. The motion makes no effort to demonstrate that she will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a stay or that there is support for granting a stay based on any of the last three criteria. Accordingly, the Board DENIES the respondent's stay request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reputational and financial interests have not yet persuaded the Board to grant a stay as to an OSC Hatch Act case, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Campbell</span>, 58 MSPR 455, 457-58 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support for his motion for a stay, respondent argues that he will suffer irreparable harm because he would have to deal with the immediate impact of a 30-day loss of pay. He also argues that the stigma attached to the suspension would irreparably damage his professional reputation. However, it is well-settled that where monetary relief will make an employee whole, no irreparable harm exists. <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 94 S. Ct. 937, 39 L. Ed.2d 166 (1974); <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 282.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the party moving for the stay is required to demonstrate that the injury claimed is both certain and great. <span class="Italic">Cuomo v. NRC</span>, 772 F.2d 972 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Therefore, the argument that respondent's professional reputation will be damaged is too speculative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Berard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 24 MSPR at 349. As the Special Counsel points out, the respondent's 30-day suspension has already appeared in various newspapers. There is no reason to think that actually serving the suspension will further damage the respondent's reputation. And if he prevails before the court, his public vindication will assuage any alleged damage to his professional reputation. Moreover, if the Board were to consider potential damage to reputation, every employee who has been suspended, removed, or subjected to any other adverse action would rely on such an unsupported allegation. This argument cannot be deemed an adequate showing of irreparable harm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent asserts without any argument that no one will suffer any harm if the stay is granted. However, the Board determined that the respondent violated the Hatch Act and imposed a 30-day suspension as a penalty for the violation. Employees must be aware that if a violation of the Hatch Act has been found by the Board, the penalty will not be delayed during the appeals process. Delaying the Board penalty would likely result in employees taking their legal obligations less seriously. To the extent the spirit and intent of the Hatch Act could be compromised by the granting of a stay, substantial harm could occur.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized the decisions denying a stay of a penalty pending judicial review of a Special Counsel action, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 60 MSPR 649, 650-54 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of their motion for a stay, respondents argue that there is a strong likelihood that they will be able to convince the Federal Circuit to overturn the Board's final decision and to rule in favor of the recommended decision of the Board's Chief Administrative Law Judge (CALJ) that was not adopted by the Board. They imply the court will give greater consideration to the recommended decision than to the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents' argument, however, must fail for several reasons. First, the recommended decision issued by the CALJ in accordance with 5 USC &#x00A7; 557 is just as the name suggests--a recommendation<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.129. The Board is free either to adopt or reject the CALJ's findings and conclusions of law. <span class="Italic">See Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246, 1252 (4th Cir. 1986). The reviewing court reviews the decision of the Board, not that of the CALJ<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, case law arising under the Board's appellate jurisdiction concerning initial decisions of administrative judges supports the conclusion that the Board is free to substitute its own decision for that of the CALJ. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 594, 595 (1991) (the Board may substitute its own finding of facts giving the administrative judge's findings only as much weight as may be warranted by the record and the strength of the administrative judge's reasoning).... Here, the Board substituted its own judgment for that of the CALJ because the CALJ's findings of fact were not all supported by the record and the CALJ erred with respect to his interpretation of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board was not bound to accept, but could revise or reject the CALJ's determinations, the Board's final decision is subject to limited review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Under the standard of judicial review set forth at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c), the Court may set aside a Board decision only if it finds it to be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a case where the Board acts to implement its statutory authority, such as to interpret a law it is charged with overseeing, the reviewing court will give great deference to such a decision and will not substitute its own judgment unless it is unreasonable or clearly unlawful....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has statutory authority to hear and adjudicate the complaint alleging prohibited personnel practices filed by the Special Counsel in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204. The Board's detailed decision in this case was reached in full compliance with required procedures, is strongly supported by the record and is well-reasoned, meticulously explaining the legal support for its decision. The Board's decision, necessarily interpreting 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) and &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)], is in accordance with the plain words of the statute and with applicable case law, and is entitled to deference by the Federal Circuit. Therefore, the respondents have not established that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed on the merits in their appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondents also have not demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Board's Order is not stayed. While respondent Byrd argues that the $1000 fine would be a financial hardship in light of his financial situation, the law has consistently been that financial loss does not constitute irreparable harm where monetary relief will make an employee whole. <span class="Italic">See Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 94 S. Ct. 937, 39, 39 L. Ed.2d 166 (1974); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Campbell</span>, 58 MSPR at 457; <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR at 282.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, respondent Rubinstein's contention that he will suffer irreparable harm because a suspension will damage his reputation is not convincing. A party moving for the stay is required to demonstrate that the injury claimed is both certain and great, and argument that one's professional reputation will be damaged is too speculative<span class="Italic">. See respectively</span>, <span class="Italic">Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 772 F.2d 972 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 58 MSPR at 458; <span class="Italic">Berard v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 347, 349 (1984). We note in this regard that the Board's decision in this case is a matter of public record and any damage to respondent Rubinstein's reputation has already occurred. Serving the suspension will not substantially increase the impact of the Board's decision on his reputation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Campbell</span>, 58 MSPR at 458 (because newspapers reported the Board's decision to suspend the respondent, actually serving the suspension would not further damage his reputation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the third criterion, the respondents have not shown that substantial harm to other interested parties would ensue if the Board's decision is enforced. On the other hand, as the Special Counsel points out, the Board's clarification of the law interpreting both 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) and &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] benefits the Federal civil service, and a stay of its decision would delay and thus undermine such benefits. Further, delaying the imposition of the Board's penalties could cause employees to take their legal obligations less seriously, and substantial harm could result from such compromising with respect to the spirit and intent of the law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that when an employee has been found to have committed a prohibited personnel practice, it is not in the public interest to delay compliance with the Board order imposing the penalty. <span class="Italic">Hathaway</span>, 52 MSPR at 379.... This is especially so in this case where the Board's decision provides important and necessary guidance to <span id="Page_1821"></span>the Special Counsel and to federal agencies on the interpretation of the prohibited personnel practices set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302((b)(6) and &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)]. Thus, the public interest would not be served in granting a stay in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the final <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> decision, 1 MSPR 280, 283-84, 1 MSPB 268 (1979), brought to secure relief for employees who complained of reprisals for protected activities, the Board declined to stay reassignments pending review of its decision in the court of appeals. It observed that whistleblowing allegations would not perpetually shield an employee from subsequent properly motivated personnel actions. The Board stated that "[e]ven a cursory reading of the legislative history of the Reform Act shows the clear Congressional intention that whistleblowing claims must carefully be weighed against legitimate management prerogatives." 1 MSPR at 283 n.8, 1 MSPB at 270 n.8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to stay the imposition of a fine in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 28 MSPR 425, 426 (1985). Under <span class="Italic">Starrett</span>, the movant must show: (1) the likelihood that the appeal will succeed on its merits; (2) the degree to which the movant will suffer irreparable injury if the stay is denied; (3) the substantial harm that other parties involved may suffer if the stay is granted; and (4) whether the public interest is served by granting the stay. <span class="Italic">Starrett</span> cited <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 90, 94 S. Ct. 937 (1974), for the proposition that "mere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay, are not enough."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to judicial intervention in Hatch Act cases, the Federal Circuit noted the statutory and judicial considerations applicable to stay applications entertained by district courts, explaining in <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, 15 F.3d 46, 48-49 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB contends that the district court's stay of its removal order was improper because Williams was not suspended from office during the pendency of the appeal on the merits. In support of this argument, the MSPB relies on the precise language of &#x00A7; 1508, which provides, in part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A party aggrieved by a determination or order of the Merit Systems Protection Board...may...institute proceedings for review thereof by filing a petition in the United States District Court.... The institution of proceedings does not operate as a stay of the determination or order unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;the court specifically orders a stay; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;the officer or employee is suspended from his office or employment while the proceedings are pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 1508 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB argues that under the plain language of the statute, the district court should not have stayed Williams's termination without suspending her from office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court reviews a decision pertaining to injunctive relief <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">novo</span> when it "'rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance.'"... We find that the plain language of &#x00A7; 1508 requires Williams's suspension during the pendency of the appeal on the merits before a stay may be issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court discussed the power of federal courts to stay administrative agency decisions in <span class="Italic">Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. FCC</span>, 316 U.S. 4, 62 S. Ct. 875, 86 L. Ed. 1229 (1942). The Court stated that "an appellate court should be able to prevent irreparable injury to the parties...resulting from the premature enforcement of a determination which may later be found to have been wrong." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9, 62 S. Ct. at 880. Although "'[a]stay is not a matter of right,'" a federal court may exercise judicial discretion and stay enforcement of a judgment in appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10-11, 62 S. Ct. at 880... The power of federal courts to stay orders under review may be curtailed, however, only by express language from Congress. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11, 62 S. Ct. at 880.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Congress has limited the district court's power to issue a stay in the context of a Hatch Act violation. Section 1508 sets forth two conditions which must be met for a stay to be valid: (1) the court must specifically order a stay; and (2) the employee must be suspended from her office while the proceedings are pending.</p>
