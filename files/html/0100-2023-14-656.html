<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-657"><span class="space">2.</span> Allowance for Nonproductive Time</h4>
<p class="noindent">Discussed earlier in this chapter were decisions involving proposals seeking to set certain periods of time aside for training or other tasks of a nonproductive nature. In the context of performance appraisal, the creation of nonproductive time can be important if the use of the time will not be counted against an employee in measuring his productivity <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> standards that assume an eight-hour day fully devoted to ordinary work tasks. Negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 26 FLRA 612, 614-15 (1987) (Proposal 1), was a provision that employees involved in retraining for a new or changed task be given at least two hours of "non-measured" work time to set up their desks and adjust work patterns in accordance with their new instructions. Although the proposal directly infringed on management's right to direct work, the proposal was an appropriate arrangement because it limited the type of work that could be assigned during the designated period. The ruling was interesting because of the focus of the adverse effects test. The focus was on the immediate effect on productivity--not a direct adverse impact on the employee through loss of benefits or immediate disciplinary action. The adverse effect was more diffuse:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights to direct employees and to assign work.... The Agency makes no claim, nor is it otherwise evident from the record, that it is unnecessary to rearrange desks in order to comply with the revised training memo. The Union asserts that rearranging desks is a preliminary requirement to carrying out assignments in conformity with the new training memo.... The proposal deals with this requirement, which is nonproductive time in terms of employees' performance appraisals, by excluding the time devoted to rearranging desks from the time available for productive work. If the time sought by the proposal is not granted, the employees' production would be adversely affected. They would, of necessity, have to devote production time to the tasks of rearranging their desks. The inevitable consequence would be a decrease in the employees' level of performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The remaining question is whether the burden imposed on management's rights by the proposal is excessive when weighed against the proposal's benefit to employees. We conclude that, on balance, the benefit accruing to the concerned employees outweighs the detriment imposed on management's rights to direct employees and to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1100"></span>As has been noted, the proposal provides for the assignment of a task necessitated by management's revision of its operating procedures. The Agency does not contend that the two hours required by the proposal are excessive. If, however, the Agency views the time allocation as excessive, a position not stated in the record, that issue is appropriate for resolution during negotiations or, if necessary, during impasse proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal also appears to provide for a more accurate assessment of employees' performance. The time devoted to rearranging desks is time during which employees cannot be engaged in producing the final products by which their performance is measured. To include such time in the hours available for production of work for performance appraisal purposes would be a misrepresentation detrimental to the employees involved, and would not be an accurate measure of employees' ability or motivation. Moreover, the situation addressed by the proposal is not one for which the employees are responsible since the decision to revise work procedures was made by management within its sole discretion. The task addressed by the proposal is assigned by management and is nonrecurring. The Union only seeks to establish that the existing standards do not measure employees' performance during execution of this one-time, short term task. Consequently, we conclude that the proposal does not excessively interfere with the development of performance standards.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32</span> result depended on application of arrangements bargaining. A proposal directly interfered with management's right to assign work and, without a claim that it constituted a negotiable arrangement, was nonnegotiable that defined "examples of authorized time spent performing other duties and responsibilities which shall not adversely affect an employee's production or timeliness requirements." <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 354 (1991) (Provision 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria</span>, 49 FLRA 874, 876-77 (1994) (nonnegotiable--without arrangements claim--Provision 2, preventing management from considering employees' time spent waiting for tools and equipment in evaluating their performance). A nonnegotiable proposal required an agency to grant additional time for certain tasks or not to count certain time when making determinations as to the quantity and timeliness of the employees' work product. It interfered with the rights of the agency to assign and direct work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 18 FLRA 305, 306 (1985)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable as an arrangement was Provision 22 in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 55 (1993), seeking three hours of "nonexamining time" (time that would not be assessed against production standards) for unit employees to familiarize themselves with new procedures for handling "reexaminations." <span class="Italic">POPA </span>also approved as negotiable Provision 20, requesting agreement that unit employees account for the time spent each quarter reporting their own work statistics and to obtain exceptions or waivers of requirements under performance standards. FLRA did not credit the agency's argument that the proposal required the assignment of work, 47 FLRA at 53:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that Provision 20 directly interferes with management's right to assign work, because it requires that employees record certain information. Procedures entailing some assignment of work to employees do not necessarily interfere with that right. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1384 and U.S. Department of Air Force, 3245th Air Base Group, Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts</span>, 41 FLRA 195, 205-06 (1991) (holding that proposal, requiring "[a]gency employees" to perform additional work to implement it, did not directly interfere with management's right to assign employees and work), and <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Department of Transp., United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 213-14 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Merchant Marine Academy</span>) (provision establishing committee of bargaining unit employees to review and make recommendations on proposed adverse actions found not to directly interfere with management's right to assign work). In this case, as in the cited cases, management is required to assign work to examiners who are in the bargaining unit. Accordingly, based on the reasoning in the cited cases, Provision 20 does not interfere with the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA approved as negotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> Provisions 23 and 24, requiring detailed documentation of time spent on various elements of employees' work and requiring the recording of time spent on activities, outside the employees' primary functions, that may affect their ability to meet management's timeliness standards. 47 FLRA at 56-59. <span class="Italic">See POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 73-86 (2000) (considering negotiability of 11 task-specific proposals involving "special examining time" (included in the total amount of examining time used to determine productivity) and "nonexamining time" (excluded from the total amount of time used to measure productivity) in examining patents). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 56 FLRA 69, 81-82 (2000) (more extensive arrangements for the apportionment of nonexamining time to become familiar with new work were nonnegotiable; they unduly interfered with management's right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent">Starting with <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243 and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 49 FLRA 176 (1994), FLRA became more selective about the proposals that it will approve as arrangements. Following that decision, proposals must be tailored carefully to meet needs of specific groups of employees affected by specific exercises of management rights. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, San Diego</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1079, 1083-84 (1994), FLRA disapproved a proposal (Provision 2) that "[d]owntime will be approved for periods of packing, moving and unpacking as well as any systems failures in connection with the move that affect employee[s'] performance of their GJTs [Generic Job Tasks]." The proposal was not properly tailored to constitute an appropriate arrangement. The views of the FLRA members are separately stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated in the separate opinions of Member Armendariz and Chairman McKee set forth below, the Authority finds that Provision 2 does not constitute an arrangement because it is not tailored and is, therefore, nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opinion of Member Armendariz</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In my opinion, Provision 2 is not an arrangement for the following reasons. I find that consistent with my separate opinion in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, in order for a proposal to constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it must be tailored so as to benefit or compensate <span class="Italic">only</span> those employees who would suffer an identifiable adverse effect as a result of the exercise of a management right. Because Provision 2 is not limited only to those employees who would receive lower performance appraisals as a result of the factors noted in the provision, but applies to all employees who have less time to perform their GJTS, Provision 2 is not an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As Provision 2 directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work and is not an arrangement, I conclude that Provision 2 is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opinion of Chairman McKee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, the Authority agreed with various court decisions that under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, arrangements must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects from the exercise of a management right and cannot be so broad as to apply to all employees without regard to whether they are likely to suffer such adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As worded, I conclude, in agreement with my colleagues, that Provision 2 affords downtime to all employees affected by the relocation. However, I conclude also that the provision would afford downtime without regard to whether those employees' performances are, or likely would be, adversely affected by time spent on activities associated with the relocation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, I am unable to conclude that the Union intends its reference to matters that "affect" employee performance as encompassing only adverse effects. In this regard, the record reflects that, in a section which was not disapproved by the Agency head and which would immediately precede Provision 2 in the MOU, the parties agreed to require the Agency to give full and fair consideration to "factors adversely affecting performance as a result of the relocation." That this other, related provision is expressly limited to addressing adverse effects of the relocation supports an interpretation of Provision 2 as not encompassing such limitation. Moreover, there is no basis on which to conclude that it would be difficult for the Union to identify which employees are likely to suffer adverse effects from the relocation or to target those employees in the provision. As such, I find the provision distinguishable from Provision 4 in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, which a majority of the Authority found constituted an arrangement despite its prophylactic nature because, among other things, it was "impossible to determine reliably" which employees likely would suffer adverse effects. 49 FLRA at 191. Finally, the Union has not alleged or shown, and it is not otherwise apparent to me, that a failure to approve downtime for affected employees necessarily would adversely affect them. In fact, it appears reasonable to conclude that some of the employees encompassed by Provision 2 would, in fact, be entirely unaffected by such failure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I adhere to the view expressed by a majority of the Authority in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> that, to constitute arrangements, proposals need not be so narrowly tailored in all cases as to benefit or compensate only those employees who would suffer an adverse effect as a result of an exercise of a management right. However, I find no circumstances in this case which justify a failure to expressly target adversely affected employees. I conclude, therefore, that Provision 2 is not sufficiently tailored and, as a result, does not constitute an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As the provision directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work, it is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 and U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 470 (1994) (Proposal 1) (Member Armendariz concurring).</p>
