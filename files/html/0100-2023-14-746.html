<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-747"><span class="space">7.</span> Excepted Service Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">Excepted service preference eligibles normally may appeal adverse actions to the MSPB if they have survive a one-year trial period. Formerly, the nonpreference eligible had no MSPB appeal right, a state of affairs modified by statute as of August 1990 by the Civil Service Due Process Amendments establishing tenure (or appeal rights) after a two-year trial or probationary period. FLRA recognizes that excepted service personnel may negotiate protections in their contracts commensurate with the protections afforded by the 1990 legislation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 357 (1991) (Provisions 4-8); <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 67-69 (1991) (Provisions 16 and 17). Proposals recognizing or conferring appeal rights on excepted service personnel are not barred from negotiation because they do not state conditions that may bar certain grievances (e.g., those challenging actions arising prior to the 1990 legislation) of employees. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 41 FLRA 982, 989 (1991) (Article 12).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to contracts negotiated before the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, and to the extent those amendments still do not cover all excepted service employees during the initial periods of their appointments, the question arose whether contract protections could be provided excepted service employees without preference status. In <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region V, Chicago</span>, 25 FLRA 1110 (1987), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 30 FLRA 656 (1987), FLRA decided that excepted service employees could be provided protection of grievance procedures. In 1988 FLRA reaffirmed the right to negotiate for grievance and arbitration coverage of excepted service employees' adverse or disciplinary actions in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 31 FLRA 181, 189-90 (1988) (Provision 4). The leading FLRA cases were then reversed in court.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1988, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region V, Chicago</span>, 25 FLRA 1110 (1987), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was reversed by <span class="Italic">DHHS v. FLRA</span>, 858 F.2d 1278, 1279-84 (7th Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The central issue in this case is whether attorneys at HHS, whom Congress gave limited rights of review over adverse employment decisions, may nonetheless collectively bargain to bring employment-related claims before an independent arbitrator....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder Chapters 43 and 75 of the CSRA nonpreference excepted service employees are not entitled to have adverse employment action reviewed by the MSPB or the Federal Circuit, although they are entitled to certain procedural safeguards under Chapter 43....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The negotiated grievance procedure is generally the exclusive procedure for resolving grievances.... One exception to this rule, however, is "matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512...which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1).... [A]t least with respect to competitive and preference eligible excepted service employees, Congress contemplated that the grievance procedure authorized in the LMRS could cover action which was also within the scope of Chapters 43 and 75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...7103(a)(12) specifies in part that collective bargaining means bargaining in good faith with respect to "conditions of employment."... As noted, the phrase "conditions of employment" is defined to include essentially all personnel practices, except "to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by federal statute." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). Accordingly, if the remedies afforded to nonpreference excepted service employees in Chapters 43 and 75 are exclusive, NTEU's proposal, which would expand the remedies available to this classification of employees to include appeal to an arbitrator, would be inconsistent with federal law and therefore prohibited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis of this issue is substantially informed by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 108 S. Ct. 668 (1988)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> does not specifically address the LMRS, its rationale demonstrates that the rights and remedies available to a nonpreference excepted service employee under the CSRA when an agency takes adverse employment action are "a maximum" and therefore are not conditions of employment subject to collective bargaining under the LMRS....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The thrust of the <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> opinion is that the delicate balancing between the needs of efficient agency administration and employment protection that is embodied in this framework would be undermined if nonpreference excepted service employees could contest adverse employment action outside the agency.... Accordingly, we hold that NTEU's proposal is not negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Then, in 1989, the D.C. Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1467, 1469-72 (D.C. Cir. 1989), reversed FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 30 FLRA 656 (1987), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he issue is substantially affected--if not controlled--by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If NEES [nonpreference eligible excepted service] employees could contest adverse personnel actions through arbitration, which they cannot appeal to the MSPB, arbitrators would not be statutorily bound to apply MSPB precedent to those proceedings...and could treat NEES employees more favorably than competitive service employees, thereby inverting the Act's preference for the latter category of employees. In this case, to be sure, the same collective bargaining agreement would cover both competitive service and NEES employees, so it might be thought that arbitrators would tend to apply the statutory standards to both categories. But arbitrators would not be so obliged by the CSRA. Moreover, consistent treatment of the two categories would seem less likely if NEES employees were represented--as we must contemplate--in a separate unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see, then, that the FLRA's interpretation of the statute runs the risk of inverting the preference granted to competitive service employees and veterans <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> NEES employees, and threatens MSPB primacy in developing administrative law governing adverse actions against federal employees--both considerations which underlay the Supreme Court's concern in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's statutory interpretation, moreover, creates other anomalies inconsistent with congressional purposes. Congress specifically delegated to OPM, not the FLRA, discretion to extend statutory appeal rights under chapter 75 to NEES employees. In other words, OPM, the Executive Branch's personnel management arm, was given the extraordinary authority to trigger MSPB and federal judicial review of Executive Branch disciplinary actions against NEES employees. Were we to accept the FLRA's position--thus allowing NEES employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement to gain these appeal rights through arbitration--OPM, in order to insure uniformity over the resolution of these issues, could well feel obliged to extend MSPB review to all NEES employees. By taking that action, which would oust the FLRA of jurisdiction, OPM could prevent potential inconsistencies in personnel actions--at least with respect to chapter 75--but only at the cost of surrendering the independence of its decision whether to extend MSPB and judicial review to this class of employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if OPM did extend chapter 75 review procedures to NEES employees, it would lack the statutory authority to do so for chapter 43 personnel actions.... This would mean unionized NEES employees could gain a substantial advantage over those not covered by collective bargaining agreements, because the former could gain review by an arbitrator of discipline or discharge for poor work performance, while the latter would have no such right of review by either an arbitrator or the MSPB. <span id="page_1166"></span>Generally, however, as we have noted, the statutory structure manifests a desire for equal substantive protections against discipline or discharge for all federal employees in the same classification....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That Congress envisioned the availability of grievance procedures for certain specialized personnel, notwithstanding the absence of a statutory right of appeal, does not alter our conclusion that arbitration is unavailable for NEES employees. Congress provided that matters relating to adverse personnel actions which arise under "<span class="Italic">other personnel systems</span>...may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employees, be raised either under the appellate procedures, <span class="Italic">if any</span>, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated procedure, but not both." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1).... The inclusion of the words "if any" does show Congress contemplated that some of these employees, who fall under specialized personnel systems apart from the main civil service system, would negotiate for grievance procedures although they have no statutory right of appeal.... The excepted service personnel involved in these cases, however, are covered by the main civil service system and not by the provision relating to specialized personnel systems; section 7121(e)(1) thus does not affect our analysis of the remedial structure set forth in title 5.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Seventh Circuit and D.C. Circuit decisions were followed, in a <span class="Italic">per curiam</span> decision, by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">DHHS, Region IX v. FLRA</span>, 894 F.2d 333, 334 (9th Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">reversing</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Region IX, San Francisco</span>, 31 FLRA 993 (1988). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Capitol Police v. Office of Compliance</span>, 908 F.3d 749, 763-64 (Fed. Cir. 2018) ("Other circuits have read <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> to preclude executive branch employees (when not entitled to MSPB review as to adverse personnel actions) from resort to review through CBA grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 873 F.2d 1467, 1469-72 (D.C. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. v. Fed.

Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 894 F.2d 333, 334 (9th Cir. 1990). Those circuits have relied on the election of remedies provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) (set forth below) as allowing arbitration only as an alternative to MSPB review. If MSPB review is not available, neither is arbitration.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the Civil Service Due Process Amendments expanded protections for many excepted service personnel, some nonpreference eligible excepted service employees are beyond the protections of the Act. By statute, those employees must have two years of "current continuous service in the same or similar positions" in an executive agency to appeal from an adverse action or an action based on unacceptable performance. The union may not negotiate for a shorter period of service leading to eligibility to grieve those actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 52 FLRA 1265, 1267-68, 1271 (1997) (Proposals 2 and 7). For those individuals, grievance procedures may not be negotiated, but they may have the benefit of administrative grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Panama Area Metal Trades Council</span>, 43 FLRA 1483 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 1075 (1992) (explaining why other NAF employees could negotiate grievance procedures that would encompass adverse actions).</p>
<p class="noindent">Even though excepted service employees who have neither preference eligibility nor appeal rights under the Civil Service Due Process Amendments may have no ability to arbitrate "major" adverse actions, the D.C. Circuit concluded in <span class="Italic">Suzal v. Director, USIA</span>, 32 F.3d 574, 580-82 (D.C. Cir. 1994), that they may obtain arbitration of prohibited personnel practice allegations leading, if sustained, to renewal of their appointments or other relief. The court, considering the jurisdiction of the federal district court to hear an action to enjoin an allegedly retaliatory dismissal, determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4), the collective bargaining agreement excludes from the negotiated procedure any grievance concerning an "examination, certification or appointment." But we read the word "appointment" in the context of both statute and agreement to refer only to <span class="Italic">initial</span> appointments, not to reappointments. The FLRA appears to agree. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Fed'n of Fed. Employees Local 1636 v. United States Dep't of Defense, Nat'l Guard Bur.</span>, 48 FLRA 511, 513-14 (1993); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Defense, Office of Dependents</span> <span class="Italic">Schools v. Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 45 FLRA 1411, 1415-17 (1992);<span class="Italic"> cf. Brammer v. United States</span>, 24 Cl. Ct. 487, 492 (1991). In our view, then, the collective bargaining agreement purports to give Suzal the right to submit his nonrenewal to the negotiated grievance procedure on both his reprisal theory and his First Amendment theory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the version of the CSRA in effect at the time of <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, members of the competitive service and "preference eligible" members of the excepted service could appeal "adverse actions" (other than minor suspensions) to the MSPB. But nonpreference eligible excepted-service employees--that is, members of the excepted service who were not veterans or close relatives of veterans, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)--had no such right. A union representing some of these so-called "NEES" employees nonetheless demanded that the Treasury Department bargain over a proposal to let them challenge major adverse actions through arbitration. We held that the agency had no obligation to bargain over this topic.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, our holding in <span class="Italic">Office of Chief</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel</span> does not by itself compel the conclusion that Congress barred agencies from deciding, of their own accord, to agree to let NEES employees go to arbitration over major adverse actions. Indeed, we said later that <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> found no such bar. <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 966 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1990). One might well argue that Congress merely wanted agencies to be free of mandatory bargaining that could push open the door to arbitrability. But the logic of <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel </span>was broader, for we concluded that "Congress intended these excepted service employees to have no right to arbitral review." <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 873 F.2d at 1468; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. v. FLRA</span>, 894 F.2d 333, 334 (9th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. v. FLRA</span>, 858 F.2d 1278, 1284 (7th Cir. 1988). We agree with the parties that <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> strongly suggests that an agency cannot let its employees challenge major "adverse actions" through arbitration when Congress has specifically precluded them from appealing such actions to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel </span>should not be read too broadly. The CSRA itself assumes that employees often will have access to arbitration even when they lack any statutory avenues of relief. It gives each "employee"--defined to include almost anyone "employed in an agency," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(A)--the right to join a union and (through union representatives) "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. It then <span class="Italic">requires</span> the collective bargaining agreements that agencies sign to "provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). Though they may "exclude any matter" from the negotiated procedure's coverage, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(2), and indeed must exclude some specified matters, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(c), the agreements have to provide that any covered grievance not "satisfactorily settled" under the negotiated procedure "shall be subject to binding arbitration" that can be invoked by either the union or the agency, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(b)(3)(C). And the CSRA defines "grievance" extraordinarily broadly, to include (among other things) "any complaint by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>&#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In keeping with its broad definitions of "grievance" and "employee," the CSRA goes on to set out certain rules that apply <span class="Italic">except</span> when a matter covered by the negotiated grievance procedure is also covered by a statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(a) (making negotiated grievance procedure the exclusive means of resolving covered grievances "[e]xcept as provided in subsections (d) and (e) of this section," which address grievance procedures that overlap with statutory remedies for "prohibited personnel practices" and "adverse actions"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(d) (creating another special exception where matters that can be raised under a negotiated grievance procedure are also covered by a statutory appeals procedure). These exceptions would make no sense unless Congress contemplated arbitration for a broader class of disputes than the statutory procedures covered. While the breadth of the definitions of "employee" and "grievance" in this chapter of the CSRA does not mean that agencies can <span class="Italic">always</span> choose to give their workers arbitration rights over matters that Congress has precluded them from challenging through the statutory procedures,<span class="Italic"> see Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 873 F.2d at 1471 n.6, it does suggest that agencies can do so <span class="Italic">unless</span> there are specific indications that such arbitration rights would frustrate congressional intent<span class="Italic">. Cf. PBGC v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d 658, 665-66 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> inferred a specific intent to bar people from going to arbitration over major "adverse actions" unless they have a matching statutory right to appeal to the MSPB instead. But one can draw no parallel inference for "prohibited personnel practices." To the contrary, the special indications upon which <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span> relied apply only to "adverse actions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First and foremost, the court understood 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(2) to mean that when an employee who <span class="Italic">could</span> appeal directly to the MSPB instead opts for arbitration, "the arbitrator is governed by MSPB precedent and may not interpret a collective bargaining agreement to reach results that would not be countenanced by the MSPB under its interpretation of the statute." <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 873 F.2d at 1469. According to the court, this "unusual and sophisticated device to ensure uniformity and MSPB primacy"...was a critical part of Congress's decision to let such employees go to arbitration over major adverse actions. But, since &#x00A7; 7121(e)(2) can secure uniformity only when arbitrators are confronted with employees who could have appealed directly to the MSPB, we inferred that Congress did not intend employees who lacked this option to be able to go to arbitration over major adverse actions. This reasoning, however, does nothing to block people from going to arbitration over <span class="Italic">other</span> personnel actions. Because &#x00A7; 7121(e)(2) applies only to cases involving major adverse actions, an arbitrator confronted with Suzal's allegation of "prohibited personnel practices" would be no more or less bound by MSPB precedent than he would be in adjudging parallel allegations brought by an employee who was covered by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second aspect of the "uniformity problem" identified in <span class="Italic">Office of Chief <span id="page_1167"></span>Counsel</span> is also restricted to major "adverse actions." As we observed, the CSRA generally permits arbitrators' decisions to be appealed only to the FLRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1470; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). But in cases of major adverse actions that the aggrieved employee could have appealed directly to the MSPB, the arbitrator's decision is subject to the review provisions that would have applied to an MSPB decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7121(f). Generally, this means that the arbitrator's decision can be appealed only to the Federal Circuit, whose review is less deferential than the FLRA's would have been<span class="Italic">. See id</span>., &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). It would be odd, <span class="Italic">Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Chief Counsel</span> observed, if arbitrators' decisions in some cases were subject to review only in the Federal Circuit while their decisions in other cases--exactly parallel except that the aggrieved employee lacked MSPB appeal rights--were subject to review only in the FLRA.... For the court, this was further evidence that Congress did not intend people who lacked MSPB appeal rights to be able to go to arbitration over major adverse actions. But this concern again applies only to cases involving major adverse actions. Since arbitrators' decisions in cases of "prohibited personnel practices" can be appealed only to the FLRA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a), USIA's decision to give Suzal arbitration rights in such cases does not detract from any congressional device for assuring uniformity.</p>
