<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-303"><span class="space">b.</span> New Duties</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general rule, service efficiency is not promoted if an agency moves an employee out of a job he can perform, places him in a job he cannot perform, and then removes him. Legitimate management reasons can undercut this rule, e.g., advancement in a training position or a required progression under a labor agreement. But if the employee has difficulty in the new position and there are no good reasons for failing to meet the employee's request for return to the old position, removal will not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Majors v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 146, 150, 3 MSPB 254 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed application of <span class="Italic">Majors</span> in <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 143 F.3d 1475, 1478-80 (Fed. Cir. 1998), overturning a Board decision sustaining the removal of an employee dismissed from a job requiring higher accuracy than the job he held before his reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because it cannot rely on the national agreement as requiring Vidal's removal, the agency must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Vidal's removal promoted the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (1994); <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, 900 F.2d at 1544. In general, "the efficiency of the service may not be promoted where an agency moves an employee out of a job he is skilled in, places him into a job he cannot handle, and then removes him. However, legitimate management reasons can underlie such a result in some cases." <span class="Italic">Majors v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Serv.,</span> 3 MSPB 254, 255, 3 MSPR 146, 149 (1980). The AJ in her initial decision relied on this rule to affirm Vidal's removal, but the AJ failed to make any findings as to how Vidal's removal promoted the efficiency of the service or why his removal was more efficient than his retention in his original PTF position operating the FSM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the Board, in reviewing a removal decision by an agency, <span id="Page_2841"></span>must consider whether a legitimate management reason justified reassigning an employee from a position in which he performed well to a position for which he failed to qualify. There may be many valid reasons that support an agency's decision to assign involuntarily a qualified employee to a new, more difficult position for which he may or may not qualify. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wright,</span> 900 F.2d at 1544 (noting that "developmental air traffic controllers enter an 'up or out' training course," and that the agency can make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that efficiency of the service justifies removal "by showing that the trainee received the established training course and failed"); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. United States,</span> 189 Ct. Cl. 191, 416 F.2d 1277, 1281-82 (1969) (explaining that, if the relevant job standards require an employee to train and qualify for a more difficult position, an employee who fails to qualify may be removed). We agree that Vidal's reassignment from the PTF position on the FSM to the permanent position operating the more difficult LSM was a legitimate management decision because it was required in these circumstances by the provisions of the national agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ and the Board failed to recognize, however, that consideration of whether Vidal's reassignment was based on a legitimate management reason does not end the legally-required inquiry. Merely showing that the transfer was based on a legitimate management reason is not enough; under <span class="Italic">Majors,</span> the agency must further demonstrate that the efficiency of the service would be promoted <span class="Italic">more</span> by the employee's removal than by the employee's retention in his former position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 3 MSPB at 256-57, 3 MSPR at 150. In circumstances involving a change in position prior to removal, we agree with the Board's statement of the law that "part of the agency's burden is to demonstrate that reaching [promoting involuntarily] appellant for the new position <span class="Italic">and then removing him</span> for scheme failure [failure to qualify for the new position] <span class="Italic">promotes the efficiency of the service more than would his retention in or return to his former position</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). To the extent there is any confusion, we hereby explicitly adopt the legal test set forth by the Board in <span class="Italic">Majors.</span> In Vidal's case, the Board failed to perform this comparative analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are some positions for which training for the next level position is an explicit job requirement set forth in either the job standards or some other controlling regulation or formal agency policy. A common example of these so-called "up-or-out" or "up-grade training" positions is air traffic controller. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wright,</span> 900 F.2d at 1544; <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 416 F.2d at 1280. In <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, for example, the Court of Claims noted that the job specification for each level of air traffic controller required, as part of the job, a variety of training courses, on-the-job training, and successful promotion to the next level. <span class="Italic">See</span> 416 F.2d at 1279. Furthermore, the court noted that "the Agency training program is designed to produce fully qualified journeymen air traffic controllers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1281. The court therefore concluded that, although low level, air traffic controller "trainees" did perform a variety of functions that were useful to the agency, "the performance of such service was itself a form of training and...a necessary prerequisite to participation in the formal up-grade training program." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, according to the Court of Claims, the plaintiffs' failure to qualify for the next level position justified their removal by the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The situation here is not comparable to that in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> or <span class="Italic">Wright</span> because the PTF position which Vidal held was not an up-or-out position. The agency implies that, because the national agreement requires that the senior PTF be promoted into a vacant permanent position where no other qualified candidates bid on it, Vidal's PTF position was an up-or-out position. But Article 37, section 5, paragraph C(6) simply states that "[i]f there are no remaining currently qualified part-time flexibles for a duty assignment, the senior part-time flexible...will be assigned and placed into training." This provision of the national agreement is simply a procedural mechanism by which vacancies may be filled; it does not change the job standards applicable to employees in PTF positions. Furthermore, there is no indication, either in the national agreement or in the PTF job standards, that all PTF clerks are required to train and qualify for permanent positions. Thus, the evidence in the record does not support the agency's implicit contention that Vidal's PTF position on the FSM was an up-or-out position, such that his failure to qualify for the LSM automatically required his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not suggest that only up-or-out or up-grade training employees who fail to qualify for the next job level can legitimately be removed, however. Indeed, there may be many other situations in which an agency's efficiency would be better served by removing an employee who failed to qualify for a higher or more difficult position than by retaining that employee in his former position. The Board in <span class="Italic">Majors,</span> for example, suggested several circumstances that might justify the removal of an employee who failed to qualify for a new position: "It may well be that appellant's return to his prior position was not possible due to the operation of applicable provisions of the National [Collective Bargaining] Agreement, or because there were no vacant slots for him there." 3 MSPB at 256-57, 3 MSPR at 150. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Springer v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 7 MSPB 63, 7 MSPR 143 (1981), the appellant's removal was found to be justified when, after a Postal Service reorganization, the position which he had held and performed satisfactorily for fifteen years was abolished, he failed to qualify for a clerk position, and he refused to accept an alternative position as a cleaner. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 64-65, 7 MSPR at 145. Alternatively, in this case, perhaps the agency was phasing out the use of the FSM, or was downsizing its staff by either reassigning or dismissing all PTF clerks or allowing their ranks to thin through attrition and non-replacement. Any of these reasons, or others about which we could easily speculate but which have not been raised here, might well have justified Vidal's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But while we might hypothesize as to the possible rational management goals which might justify the agency's removal of Vidal, the agency cannot; the agency must bear its burden of proof. The agency must produce actual evidence or argument to suggest it would have achieved greater efficiency from Vidal's removal than it would have from his retention. Furthermore, it is not our role as a reviewing court to infuse the Board's opinion with the fact-finding necessary to sustain the decision. To succeed before the Board, the agency was required to demonstrate that removing Vidal was more efficient than retaining him in his original PTF position. As far as we can surmise from the Board opinions and the record on appeal, this it has failed to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency initially relied simply on the terms of the national agreement and Vidal's failure to achieve a qualifying score to justify its removal action. The agency provided no argument or direct evidence that we can discern to explain why Vidal could not have been returned to his original PTF position. Furthermore, the record does not indicate that the agency even considered retaining Vidal in a PTF capacity, much less explain why retaining him as an employee was less efficient than removing him. Yet Vidal had performed the PTF job for two years in a satisfactory manner, and he continued to perform his necessary FSM duties satisfactorily while he trained for the new LSM position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal here, the agency similarly failed to advance any argument or point to any evidence that arguably might prove Vidal's removal was more efficient for the agency than his retention as a PTF clerk. It appears, therefore, that the agency failed to meet its burden of proof; however, given the Board's failure to apply the test it required in <span class="Italic">Majors,</span> and its inadequate findings with respect to the efficiency analysis, we cannot be sure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of Vidal's appeal appear almost identical to the facts of <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, in which the Board clearly enunciated the correct legal standard, and applied that standard to reverse the agency's removal decision. In <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, the appellant had been "promot[ed] to a distribution clerk machine position pursuant to provisions of the National Agreement" after successfully and satisfactorily operating a letter sorting machine for five years. 3 MSPB at 254, 3 MSPR at 147. When he failed qualify on the required "scheme" for the new position, he was removed. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. On appeal to the Board, he argued that he should have been retained in his prior position rather than removed, and the Board agreed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 255-57, 3 MSPR, at 149-50. Specifically, the Board found that although the appellant had been promoted for a legitimate management reason, the agency had failed to show that the appellant's retention in his original position, after he failed to meet the requirements to operate the new machine, was impossible or inefficient. <span class="Italic">See Id</span>. at 255-57, 3 MSPR at 150. The Board held that "the efficiency of the service has not been promoted where, as here, the agency slotted an employee out of a job in which he had performed well for five years, into a position which he could not handle, and then removed him." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the agency has presented no explanation for why removing Vidal altogether was more efficient than returning him to his original PTF duties operating the FSM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unable to determine from the record before us whether the agency failed altogether to present the necessary evidence to support its claim that removing Vidal was more efficient than retaining him, or whether the agency did present sufficient evidence and the Board simply failed to conduct the final comparative step in the required <span class="Italic">Majors</span> analysis. We therefore remand this case to the Board for additional consideration of the evidence already presented, if any, by the agency that would explain why Vidal's removal would promote the efficiency of the service more than his retention. We do not intend the agency to have another opportunity to present evidence to the Board on the efficiency issue; rather, we simply hold that the Board's failure to conduct the comparative aspect of the analysis was an error of law. We believe the Board should have the opportunity to reconsider the evidence before it and to make the finding required by its own precedent in <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, which we have approved here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, as it directed the agency to reinstate the appellant, the Board determined, <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 126, 128 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 6 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an agency removes an employee out of a job he is skilled in, places him into a job he cannot handle, and then removes him, it must show not only that there was a legitimate management reason for <span id="Page_2842"></span>reassigning the employee, but that the removal promotes the efficiency of the service more than would his retention in or return to his former position. <span class="Italic">See Vidal</span>, 143 F.3d at 1477; <span class="Italic">Majors v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 254, 3 MSPR 146, 149-50 (1980). The agency, therefore, had to show that it would achieve greater efficiency from the appellant's removal from the LSMO position than it would from retaining him in his part-time flexible clerk position. <span class="Italic">See Vidal</span>, 143 F.3d at 1479-80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it can be inferred from the appellant's involuntary reassignment that the agency needed an LSMO, there was unrebutted evidence that the agency also needed flat sorting machine operators. The agency did not offer any evidence showing that it could not otherwise have filled the LSMO position or that the appellant's services as a flat sorting machine operator were no longer needed. Since the agency failed to establish that the appellant's part-time flexible clerk position was abolished or that it was otherwise inefficient to retain him in his part-time clerk position, it has not shown that his removal would promote the efficiency of the service more than would his retention in his prior position. Thus, the agency has not met its burden of showing that the removal promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Majors</span>, 3 MSPR at 149-50. Accordingly, the agency's action is reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Majors</span> and <span class="Italic">Vidal</span> were distinguished when the employee was not involuntarily placed into the position leading to termination and when the employee did not request placement in a prior position, despite the offer of the employee to place her there, <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 108 MSPR 384, 394-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-30, 2008 MSPB 67 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge correctly found that it was possible for the agency to reinstate the appellant to a different position after it removed her from the Sheet Metal Trainee position because she had previously held a career or career conditional appointment in the competitive service, the agency was under no obligation to do so, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.401(a) (an agency may appoint by reinstatement to a competitive service position a person who previously held a career or career-conditional appointment); (the agency admitted that it had the authority to reassign the appellant to the WG-5 Painter Helper position). In support of her decision to mitigate the removal to reinstatement to the WG-5 Painter Helper position, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Majors v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1980), and <span class="Italic">Vidal v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 143 F.3d 1475, 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1998), for the proposition that, as a general rule, the efficiency of the service is not promoted when an agency moves an employee out of a position in which he is skilled, places him in a position in which he cannot perform, and then removes him. These cases are distinguishable from the instant appeal, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both of the cases cited by the administrative judge, the employees had been involuntarily promoted to higher level positions pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Vidal</span>, 143 F.3d at 1476; <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 147. Majors formally requested to be allowed to return to his former position before he was removed, but the agency still initiated the removal action against him. <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 149. When the employees failed to perform acceptably in their new positions, the Board and Federal Circuit held that the agency had to show that it would have achieved greater efficiency from the employees' removals than it would have from their retention in their former, less difficult positions. <span class="Italic">Vidal</span>, 143 F.3d at 1478; <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 150.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Vidal</span> and <span class="Italic">Majors</span>, the appellant had a history of successful performance in other positions she held with the agency--the WG-5 Pipefitter Helper and Painter Helper positions. However, unlike the employees in those appeals, the appellant here was not involuntarily promoted from the WG-5 Pipefitter Helper position to the WG-5 Sheet Metal Trainee position. <span class="Italic">See Lopez</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 55, &#x00B6; 2. Furthermore, during the prior appeal, the agency attempted to retain the appellant in the Painter Helper position, but the appellant insisted that she be returned to the Sheet Metal Trainee position, even if that meant moving her out of the Painter Helper position and a second removal action. Thus, unlike the employees in Vidal and Majors, the appellant voluntarily departed positions in which she had adequately performed to take the Sheet Metal Trainee position. Because Vidal and Majors are factually different from the instant appeal, they provide no support for the administrative judge's order that the agency return the appellant to the WG-5 Painter Helper position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that it was inappropriate for the administrative judge to mitigate the appellant's removal. Removal from the Sheet Metal Trainee position due to the appellant's two failing grades during the 2005 winter quarter was mandatory under the terms of the apprentice program. The deciding official considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and concluded that removal was appropriate. Although the agency could have reinstated the appellant to the WG-5 Painter Helper position, it was under no obligation to do so. The deciding official testified that he would have removed the appellant due to her failing grades even if the agency had the authority to reassign her to a WG-5 Painter Helper position. Under the circumstances, the Board cannot find that the appellant's removal was "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">See Parker</span>, 819 F.2d at 1116 (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore find that removal was a reasonable penalty. The agency's removal action is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Majors</span> was distinguished in a performance case under Chapter 43, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 644 (1992):
<span class="Italic">Majors</span> involved an adverse action under 5 USC Chapter 75, which, unlike 5 USC Chapter 43, specifically provides that an agency may take such an action only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7513(a). Thus, the appellant has failed to show how <span class="Italic">Majors</span> applies to his case....</p>
