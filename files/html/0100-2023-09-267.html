<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-264"><span class="space">f.</span> Attorney-Client Privilege</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The attorney-client privilege was described by <span class="Italic">In re United States</span>, 590 F.3d 1305, 1309-10 (Fed. Cir. 2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney-client privilege is the client's right to refuse to disclose confidential "communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice." <span class="Italic">Genentech, Inc. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n,</span> 122 F.3d 1409, 1415 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Fisher v. United States,</span> 425 U.S. 391, 403 (1976) ("Confidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance are privileged."); <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 1235 (8th ed. 2004). The privilege "encourag[es]full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients" and "recognizes that sound legal advice...depends upon the lawyer's being fully informed by the client." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States,</span> 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). But the privilege "belongs to the client, who alone may waive it." <span class="Italic">In re Seagate Tech., LLC,</span> 497 F.3d 1360, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). An attorney may not assert the privilege against the client's wishes or against the client himself. <span class="Italic">See Am. Standard, Inc. v. Pfizer, Inc.,</span> 828 F.2d 734, 745 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("The privilege is that of the client, not that of the attorney.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While "[t]he attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law," <span class="Italic">Upjohn,</span> 449 U.S. at 389, it is not "an ironclad veil of secrecy," <span class="Italic">Garner v. Wolfinbarger,</span> 430 F.2d 1093, 1101 (5th Cir. 1970). The Supreme Court has recognized exceptions to the privilege, for example, holding that it does not protect communications made in the furtherance of a crime or fraud. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Zolin,</span> 491 U.S. 554, 562-63 (1989) ("[T]he purpose of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege [is]to assure that the seal of secrecy between lawyer and client does not extend to communications made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud or crime." (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also In re Spalding Sports Worldwide,</span> Inc., 203 F.3d 800, 807 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (discussing the crime-fraud exception).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Upjohn v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383 (1980) (discussion of attorney-client privilege).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To sustain a claim of attorney-client privilege, on challenge, the party withholding material must demonstrate to the adjudicator the basis for the privilege claim: it is not a matter for the AJ's speculative conclusions, <span class="Italic">Siler v. EPA</span>, <span class="blue">908 F.3d 1291</span>, 1297-98 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first consider whether the Board erred in ruling the draft notices of proposed sanctions privileged. At the Board, "[d]iscovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b). As in district courts, a party who seeks to withhold discovery based on privilege has the burden of showing privilege applies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., In re Queen's Univ. at Kingston</span>, 820 F.3d 1287, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The burden of determining which communications are privileged and which communications fall outside the scope of the privilege rests squarely on the party asserting the privilege."); <span class="Italic">Danko v. Dep't of Def</span>., 5 M.S.P.B. 435, 436 &#x0026; n.4 (1981) (rejecting privilege claim where agency "failed to present any evidence" and noting agency "had the burden of showing it was privileged"). Though the Board has no rule requiring formal privilege logs, the Board has required the proponent of privilege "to provide sufficient information to establish that any documents withheld were privileged." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gubino v. Dep't of Transp</span>., No. AT-0752-97-0455-X-1, 2000 WL 352391, at *5 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 24, 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency sought to shield the draft proposals from discovery based on attorney-client privilege. The attorney-client privilege protects communications between a client and an attorney "for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services." <span class="Italic">In re Spalding Sports Worldwide, Inc</span>., 203 F.3d 800, 805 (Fed. Cir. 2000). An agency may be a "client" whose communications with its attorneys may be protected by the attorney-client privilege. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 617 F.2d 854, 863 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ("[I]t is clear that an agency can be a 'client' and agency lawyers can function as 'attorneys' within the relationship contemplated by the privilege...."). But as with any other client, to claim attorney-client privilege, the agency must show that the allegedly protected communication was made in confidence, between it and its attorney, "for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services [or (iii)] assistance in some legal proceeding." <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, No. BN-1221-03-0163-B-1, 2005 WL 1523232, at *5 (M.S.P.B. June 10, 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp</span>., 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (D. Mass. 1950)); <span class="Italic">see also Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States</span>, 764 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Any government claim of privilege should be made with regard to specific documents...and specify the particular privilege claimed and the basis for its assertion.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the EPA made no such showing. It did not produce a privilege log or provide information--such as the documents' authors and recipients--that would have allowed the Board to evaluate whether attorney-client privilege shields the drafts. Indeed, rather than proving that the draft proposals embody confidential attorney communications, the EPA's representations to the Board directly undermine its privilege claim. The agency informed the Board that it "d [id]n't know who drafted" the documents or when, and it speculated that "they were drafted by somebody in the HR department." Contrary to the government's assertions, the record contains no evidence that attorneys prepared--or even saw--these draft proposals.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The government's unyielding defense of this baseless position troubles the court. In its brief, the government repeatedly represented that EPA attorneys prepared the draft proposals, citing portions of the record that plainly do not support that contention. At oral argument, the government remained unable to support its position with any record evidence and, unsurprisingly, could not align its position with the actual record evidence--namely, that the EPA was unable to identify the documents' author and had suggested "somebody in the HR department." But the government nevertheless persisted. We again remind the government that "confessing error is not a sin."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having failed to show even the most basic aspect of attorney-client privilege--a communication with an attorney--the government's privilege claim fails. And in this case, we cannot say that the Board's refusal to consider the drafts could not have impacted the outcome of Mr. Siler's appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Becker v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 853 F.3d 1311, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (explaining that we overturn the Board's privilege rulings with "proof of an error that 'caused substantial harm or prejudice' such that the outcome of the case could have been affected" (quoting <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 846 F.2d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 1988))). We therefore reverse the Board's privilege ruling and remand for Mr. Siler to receive any documents withheld as privileged over his objection. As part of this discovery, Mr. Siler should receive copies of any transmittal emails that accompanied the draft proposals. He may also investigate the documents, including by reopening the record and deposing Mr. Parker and any additional witnesses first identified in the transmittal emails or draft proposals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's most extensive treatment of the attorney-client privilege appears in a decision remanding the appeal for adjudication after the Board determined the AJ improperly sanctioned the agency for refusing to disclose information, including communications concerning an adverse action exchanged between an agency lawyer and an agency labor relations specialist, covered by the privilege, <span class="Italic">Gangi v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 165, 168, 175-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 22-32 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the course of discovery, the appellant filed several sets of interrogatories with the agency, including one set addressed to John Hallinan, the labor relations specialist who had drafted the agency's notice of proposed reduction in grade. The interrogatories addressed to Hallinan asked him to identify other postal supervisors or officials with whom he had spoken or corresponded regarding the appellant, the content of such discussions and correspondence, and whether an agency attorney had made any revision to Hallinan's draft. Hallinan objected to several of the appellant's interrogatories on the grounds that they called for disclosure of information protected by the attorney-client privilege and the attorney work-product privilege. The appellant filed a motion to compel Hallinan to provide more complete responses to the interrogatories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's claim of attorney-client privilege was valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations state that the scope of discovery "covers any <span class="Italic">non-privileged</span> matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b) (emphasis added). The Board will liberally interpret the meaning of "relevant" for purposes of discovery. <span class="Italic">Bize v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 155, 164 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that under the appropriate circumstances a party may invoke a common law privilege in refusing to make a disclosure during Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Rooney v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 142, 149-50 (1985) (law enforcement privilege); <span class="Italic">In Re Subpena</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 454, 458 (1983) (attorney work product privilege). However, while the Board will recognize a valid claim of privilege, we have stated that evidentiary privileges should not be lightly granted because they are "'impediments to ascertaining [the]truth'" and "contravene the fundamental principle that 'the public...has a right to everyman's evidence.'" <span class="Italic">Vogel v. Department of Justice</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 382, 387 n.4 (1982) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney-client privilege, which the agency asserted in this case, is the oldest privilege recognized for confidential communications at common law and is intended "to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). When considering claims of <span id="Page_1249"></span>attorney-client privilege, federal courts often rely on the elements of the privilege set forth in <span class="Italic">United States v. United States Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (D. Mass. 1950):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The privilege applies only if (1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made is (a) a member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate, and (b) in connection with this communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services (iii) or assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">In re Grand Jury Subpoena</span>, 341 F.3d 331, 335 (4th Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">In re Sealed Case</span>, 737 F.2d 94, 98-99 (D.C. Cir. 1984). These are the same elements the administrative judge applied in this case. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the government context, the holder of the privilege, or the "client," is the agency or department. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Town of Norfolk v. United States Army Corps of Engineers</span>, 968 F.2d 1438, 1458 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (The Corps was a client of the U.S. Attorney); <span class="Italic">Coastal States Gas Corporation v. Department of Energy</span>, 617 F.2d 854, 863 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (an agency can be a "client" and agency lawyers can function as "attorneys" within the relationship contemplated by the privilege). Agencies, like corporations, can act only through their agents or representatives. The appellant argues that Hallinan, the labor relations specialist who communicated with the agency attorney, cannot invoke the privilege on behalf of the agency because he was "a very low level supervisor." The Supreme Court, however, has rejected the notion that the privilege is confined to senior executives who have control over corporate affairs. The Court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the corporate context, however, it will frequently be employees beyond the control group as defined by the court below--"officers and agents...responsible for directing [the company's] actions in response to legal advice"--who will possess the information needed by the corporation's lawyers. Middle level--and indeed lower-level--employees can, by actions within the scope of their employment, embroil the corporation in serious legal difficulties, and it is only natural that these employees would have the relevant information needed by corporate counsel if he is adequately to advise the client with respect to such actual or potential difficulties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Upjohn</span>, 449 U.S. at 391. Applying <span class="Italic">Upjohn</span>, the United States Claims Court (now called the Court of Federal Claims) has held that "the same reasoning and result [applies]to Government employees at all levels. <span class="Italic">See Deuterium Corporation v. United States</span>, 19 Cl. Ct. 697, 699 (1990). We agree and find that Hallinan's involvement in the appellant's reduction-in-grade entitled him to invoke the privilege on behalf of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether attorney Salvon was, in connection with this communication, acting as a lawyer. The administrative judge ruled that the privilege did not apply because the advice sought by Hallinan was primarily business advice and any legal advice offered by Mr. Salvon was merely incidental. In reaching this conclusion, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Neuder v. Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</span>, 194 F.R.D. 289 (D.D.C. 2000). In that case, the attorney was sitting on the committee that made the decision to terminate the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 291. The court found that the committee convened to make business decisions and that the lawyer was not acting as a legal advisor, but rather, in his capacity as a committee member. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 293. By contrast, the record shows that Hallinan was confidentially seeking Salvon's legal opinion about the sufficiency of the draft proposal notice, not requesting Salvon's business opinion about whether the appellant's reduction in grade was advisable. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Neuder</span> is not applicable to the facts of this case. Moreover, the Salvon-Hallinan communication was communication "for the purpose of securing primarily...an opinion of law" that concerned the legal sufficiency of an agency action. <span class="Italic">See United States Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 89 F. Supp. at 358. Thus, we find that the communication at issue falls within the scope of the attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claimed the privilege throughout the proceedings, including when it submitted the privileged materials to the administrative judge for <span class="Italic">in camera</span> review. Nevertheless, the appellant argues that the agency, by disclosing various documents during the course of discovery, waived the privilege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that the voluntary disclosure of attorney-client communications expressly waives the privilege. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Workman</span>, 138 F.3d 1261, 1263 (8th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">In Re Subpena</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 460 (Special Counsel could not claim attorney work product privilege with respect to documents he previously disclosed). Waiver extends to any information directly related to that which was actually disclosed. <span class="Italic">Workman</span>, 138 F.3d at 1263 (citing 8 Charles A. Wright, Arthur R. Miller &#x0026; Richard L. Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure &#x00A7; 2016.2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant identifies four e-mails that have been labeled Exhibits E, F, F(a) and G. According to the appellant, Exhibits F, F(a) and G were authored by Hallinan. The other e-mail, Exhibit E, was authored by Laura O'Hanlon, who the appellant alleges is a former agency attorney. The appellant does not allege that Salvon was the author or recipient of any of the e-mails. Exhibits E and F(a) relate to an earlier suspension action taken against the appellant, not the reduction-in-grade action that is the subject of the instant appeal. Because these two e-mails do not involve the same subject matter or the same attorney, we find that they are not sufficiently related to the Salvon-Hallinan communication to effect a waiver of the claimed privilege. In the e-mail labeled Exhibit F, Hallinan requested that the agency's law department review a draft proposal letter notifying the appellant of his reduction in grade. Apparently, this request was subsequently referred to Salvon and led to the Salvon-Hallinan communication. In the e-mail at Exhibit G, Hallinan informed Paul Guertin, the deciding official, that the law department had "approved" the letter of decision. Neither of these e-mails disclose the advice of counsel or other privileged information. <span class="Italic">See Upjohn</span>, 449 U.S. at 395 ("The privilege only protects disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney."); <span class="Italic">United States v. El Paso Co</span>., 682 F.2d 530, 538 n.10 (5th Cir. 1982) (the attorney-client privilege does not protect against discovery of underlying facts merely because those facts have been communicated to an attorney).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant additionally argues that "even had there been a privilege, on April 30, 2003, the day of the hearing when the agency put in two affidavits setting out the so-called legal advice provided to Hallinan, the privilege expired." Civil service rule 5.4 requires agencies, when directed by the Board, to disclose "all information, testimony, documents, and material...the disclosure of which is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation." An administrative judge may, upon determining after <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection that agency information is not privileged, furnish such information to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Montgomery v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 435 &#x00B6; 12 (1998). Such a disclosure, however, cannot be fairly characterized as a voluntary disclosure by the agency. Here, the administrative judge's decision to provide the appellant with the declarations of Hallinan and Salvon did not waive the agency's claim to attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant suggests that the privilege was waived by the disclosure of a draft version of the proposal notice. The appellant does not allege that he obtained this document through the agency's voluntary disclosure, and the record does not reveal whether the agency provided the appellant with a copy of the draft in response to a discovery request or whether the appellant obtained it through some other means. Assuming that the document was voluntarily disclosed by the agency, we find that this document does not reveal the subsequent legal advice conveyed by Salvon to Hallinan. At best, a comparison of the draft document with the final version of the proposal letter reveals that revisions were made, but such a comparison does not divulge the reasons for the changes. Therefore, the disclosure of the document did not effect a waiver of the agency's claim of attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge abused his discretion by denying the agency's claim that the Salvon-Hallinan communication was protected by attorney-client privilege and by imposing sanctions that precluded the agency from presenting the testimony of the proposing and deciding officials. We VACATE the order imposing sanctions. On remand, the administrative judge must allow the agency to present the testimony of the proposing and deciding officials. In addition, because we are vacating the initial decision and remanding this appeal for further proceedings, we find that the appellant should be afforded an additional opportunity to present evidence concerning his affirmative defenses. Although the administrative judge afforded the appellant ample opportunity to present such evidence at the original hearing, the appellant reasonably concluded that the presentation of evidence in support of his affirmative defenses would not have garnered him further relief once the administrative judge indicated that he intended to reverse the agency's action on the merits and the appellant elected to withdraw his claim for compensatory damages. Thus, on remand the administrative judge shall adjudicate the appellant's affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 564, 567, 571 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grimes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 99 MSPR 7, 7-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-9 (2005), sustained an objection to the development of evidence from agency counsel despite the appellant's argument that the case, involving an allegation of whistleblowing reprisal, presented public policy interests that outweighed the attorney-client privilege:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on an interlocutory appeal from the administrative judge's March 21, 2005 Order staying further proceedings in the appellant's individual-right-of-action (IRA) appeal and certifying for review by the Board his March 3, 2005 ruling regarding the applicability <span id="Page_1250"></span>of the attorney-client privilege. The administrative judge ruled that the appellant should be permitted to "pierce" the attorney-client privilege asserted by the agency in this case in order to obtain evidence from various agency officials, including agency counsel, regarding the advice and recommendations that agency counsel provided with respect to various agency actions at issue in the appellant's IRA appeal. For the reasons set forth below, we VACATE the administrative judge's stay order, REVERSE his ruling regarding the attorney-client privilege, and RETURN this appeal to the regional office for further adjudication consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was formerly employed as a Supervisory Police Officer (Chief of Police), GS-12, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) in New Hampshire. <span class="Italic">Grimes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 595 &#x00B6; 2 (2004). On August 1, 2003, the appellant filed an IRA appeal with the Board in which he claimed that the agency took various actions, including placing him on administrative leave, suspending him for one day, and reassigning him to the position of Property Disposal Specialist, GS-12, in retaliation for protected disclosures he made to PNS legal counsel, James Fender. According to the appellant, his disclosures to Fender concerned alleged misconduct committed by Nelson Hanson, who was the PNS physical security officer and Fender's personal friend. The agency filed a motion to dismiss the appellant's IRA appeal on the basis that the appellant did not have a reasonable belief that the matters he disclosed to Fender evidenced one of the situations specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). After the appellant responded to the agency's motion, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant's disclosures to Fender were not protected because they were made as part of the appellant's normal duties. IAF, Tab 10, Initial Decision (ID) at 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1352-54 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (disclosures an employee makes as part of his normal duties through normal channels are not protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act)). The appellant filed a petition for review challenging the initial decision and, after finding that the question regarding whether the appellant's disclosures were made "outside of normal job channels was a question of material fact that remained to be decided," <span class="Italic">Grimes</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 595 &#x00B6; 11, the Board reversed the initial decision and remanded the appeal for further adjudication. The Board determined that the appellant made a sufficient non-frivolous allegation that he engaged in protected whistleblowing that contributed to covered personnel actions to establish Board jurisdiction over his IRA appeal and to entitle him to a hearing on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the remand, the appellant attempted to use the Board's discovery process to elicit information from various agency officials regarding the advice and recommendations that Fender had made during the investigation and consideration of the appellant's alleged misconduct that resulted in his suspension and reassignment. On February 8, 2005, the appellant filed a motion to compel discovery, asserting that, during his deposition, Fender and/or the agency asserted the attorney-client privilege concerning any statements Fender made during meetings of agency officials regarding the investigation into the misconduct allegedly committed by the appellant and one of his lieutenants, Thomas Garcia. According to the appellant's motion, the administrative judge assigned to Garcia's appeal determined that the attorney-client privilege did not apply, but the parties settled the appeal before any further discovery occurred in that case. The agency filed a response to the motion to compel in which it objected to the appellant's motion and asserted that the transcript of Fender's deposition demonstrated "the very precise and limited use to which the Agency applied its valid attorney-client privilege."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After filing his motion to compel, the appellant submitted prehearing submissions in which he alleged that Fender was a personal friend of Hanson's and that Fender had influenced the agency actions taken against the appellant in retaliation for the appellant's disclosure of Hanson's misconduct. The appellant also filed a "Memorandum in Opposition to Assertion of Attorney-Client Privilege" in which he argued that Fender's role in the actions the agency took against the appellant primarily concerned business advice rather than legal advice and, therefore, Fender's communications with the agency regarding the appellant were not protected by the attorney-client privilege. The appellant also argued that, even if the advice Fender provided was legal advice, the agency had waived the privilege through disclosure to "third parties" who attended the meetings. According to the appellant's memorandum, Fender's client was Captain Kevin McCoy, the Shipyard Commander, but several parties other than McCoy attended the meetings in which Fender provided advice regarding the appellant's misconduct. The appellant also asserted that the agency waived any privilege by providing the appellant with a copy of notes taken at the meetings by Thomas Marshall, the PNS Director of Security. Although the agency redacted certain information from the copy of the notes it provided to the appellant, the appellant argued that the agency waived its privilege with respect to the redacted information because the unredacted portions of the notes disclosed some of the advice Fender provided and reflected specific orders given by either McCoy or Fender concerning the actions to be taken against the appellant and Garcia. Finally, the appellant argued that the agency could not assert the privilege with respect to Fender's communications because Fender's conduct was "criminal, fraudulent or improper." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6-8 (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Zolin</span>, 491 U.S. 554, 562 (1989)). The agency filed a response to the arguments raised in the appellant's memorandum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 3, 2005, the administrative judge issued an order in which he: (1) granted the appellant's motion to compel; (2) found that the attorney-client privilege should be pierced in this case; (3) ordered Fender, Marshall, and McCoy to answer the appellant's questions, either at deposition or in response to interrogatories, regarding the advice rendered by Fender during the meetings in question; and (4) ordered the agency to provide the appellant with an unredacted copy of Marshall's notes. The agency filed a motion to certify the administrative judge's ruling to the Board as an interlocutory appeal. The appellant opposed the agency's motion, but, on March 21, 2005, the administrative judge issued an order granting it. In the order, the administrative judge noted that the Board has stated that evidentiary privileges should not be granted lightly because they are "impediments to ascertaining the truth" and "contravene the fundamental principle that 'the public...has a right to everyman's evidence.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3 (quoting <span class="Italic">Gangi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165 &#x00B6; 23 (2004)). The administrative judge summarized the appellant's theory of the case as consisting of a claim that "Fender, as the installation legal counsel, carried out his retaliation against the appellant through his influence over an investigation involving the appellant and through recommendations Fender made to agency officials who later took the adverse actions against the appellant." The administrative judge then stated that, in his view, what Fender and the agency officials discussed was "highly relevant and the only way to determine the legitimacy of Fender's actions in this matter is to find out precisely what advice he gave to the agency officials who took the actions against the appellant." He further stated that, if the attorney-client privilege applies, it would be an impediment to ascertaining the truth in this case, and he concluded that the attorney-client privilege should be pierced under the circumstances presented.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that, under the appropriate circumstances, a party may invoke a common law privilege in refusing to make a disclosure during Board procedures. <span class="Italic">See Gangi</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165 &#x00B6; 23. In fact, this concept is incorporated into the Board's regulations governing discovery, which provide that the scope of discovery "covers any <span class="Italic">non-privileged</span> matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b) (emphasis added). The privilege the agency seeks to assert in this case, the attorney-client privilege, is the oldest privilege recognized for confidential communications at common law and is intended "to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and the administration of justice." <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney-client privilege is a communications privilege, i.e., it is a privilege based on the relationship between the parties to the communications. There are two classes of communications privileges. The first class is composed of privileges classified as "absolute." <span class="Italic">See</span> Edward J. Imwinkelreid, The New Wigmore: Evidentiary Privileges &#x00A7; 3.2.4 (2002). In the context of privileges, the term "absolute" means "that if the privilege applies and there is no applicable exception to its scope, the opposing party cannot defeat the privilege by an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span>, case-specific showing of need for the privileged information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnote omitted). The second class is composed of privileges classified as "conditional" or "qualified."[*] As opposed to an absolute privilege, a conditional or qualified privilege is one which calls for balancing the public interest in nondisclosure against the rights and needs of the individual seeking disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Childs v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 348, 352 (1995); <span class="Italic">Rooney v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 142, 147 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Imwinkelreid defines a conditional privilege as one for which "the party opposing the privilege can defeat the privilege by fulfilling the condition of demonstrating a compelling case-specific need for the privileged information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., n.140. He defines a privilege as qualified "when its enforcement is subject to the qualification that the judge may override the privilege <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> when the opposing litigant demonstrates a compelling case-specific need for the information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The privilege at issue in this interlocutory appeal, the attorney-client privilege, falls into the class of absolute privileges. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Swidler &#x0026; Berlin v. United States</span>, 524 U.S. 399, 409 (1998) (because introducing a balancing test would introduce substantial uncertainty into the privilege's application, the Court rejected the use of such a test in defining the contours of the attorney-client privilege); <span class="Italic">In re Lindsey</span>, 158 F.3d 1263, 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (although the court determined that a government attorney may not rely on the attorney-client privilege to shield information related to criminal misconduct from a grand jury, <span id="Page_1251"></span>the court rejected the district court's conclusion that a government attorney-client privilege could be overcome upon a showing of need and unavailability of the evidence elsewhere). Thus, the appellant in this case cannot defeat the privilege by a case-specific showing of need for the privileged information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, in the order certifying the issue for interlocutory appeal, it is clear that the basis for the administrative judge's ruling that the attorney-client privilege should be "pierced" in this case was his assessment of the appellant's need for the privileged information to support the appellant's theory of the case. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 5. Accordingly, to the extent that the administrative judge ruled that the agency could not rely on the attorney-client privilege to deny the appellant access to communications protected by that privilege on the basis of the appellant's need for such evidence to support his theory of the case, we REVERSE the administrative judge's ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we find that the administrative judge relied on an improper basis to deny the agency the benefit of the attorney-client privilege, our ruling does not preclude the possibility that the administrative judge may order the agency to provide the information sought by the appellant on a proper basis. For example, the appellant has argued that the information he seeks is not protected by the privilege because Fender was not acting as a lawyer during the relevant time. In the alternative, the appellant also has argued that the agency waived the privilege and that the "crime-fraud" exception to the privilege applies under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Gangi</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 165 &#x00B6; 24, the Board relied on the elements of the attorney-client privilege set forth in <span class="Italic">United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp.</span>, 89 F. Supp. 357, 358-59 (D. Mass. 1950):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The privilege applies only if (1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made is (a) a member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate, and (b) in connection with the communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c) for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or (ii) legal services (iii) or assistance in some legal proceeding, and not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, acceptance of any of the appellant's arguments could provide a proper basis for determining that the privilege does not apply with respect to specific information that the appellant seeks to compel from the agency. The administrative judge did not make specific rulings regarding these issues, however, and so they are beyond the scope of the Board's interlocutory review at this time.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant continues to allege that the administrative judge erred when he denied the appellant's request to call the agency representative as a witness. He argues that the agency's representative was the true deciding official because she was copied on the response to his Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the deciding official directed the appellant to provide his written reply to the legal office because he was not available, and a statement by the representative provided that questions about the process could be referred to her and that she would respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, the federal courts have not permitted a party to call opposing counsel as a witness unless there is a compelling need for the lawyer's testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers &#x00A7; 108(4) (2000) ("A tribunal should not permit a lawyer to call opposing trial counsel as a witness unless there is a compelling need for the lawyer's testimony."); <span class="Italic">see also United States v.

American Motors Corp.</span>, 805 F.2d 1323, 1327 (8th Cir. 1986), for one test used to determine when such testimony will be permitted). We find the general rule also to be applicable to Board proceedings. However, applying this general rule, the appellant did not have a compelling need to call the agency's representative because he could have obtained the testimony that he sought through other witnesses. The appellant could have called the deciding official to testify at the hearing regarding his role in the adverse action process. The administrative judge approved the deciding official as a witness prior to the appellant's decision to withdraw his hearing request. In addition, the agency proposed to call a Management Employee Relations Specialist to testify regarding his involvement in advising management on the removal. The administrative judge also approved this individual as a witness. The appellant could have questioned the witness during the hearing regarding his testimony and his sworn statement submitted by the agency regarding his involvement in this appeal. Because the appellant could have obtained the information he was seeking through other witnesses, we find no compelling need for the agency's representative's testimony and affirm the administrative judge's denial of the witness request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege mentioned in passing in the litigation styled <span class="Italic">In re United States</span>, 590 F.3d 1305, 1309-10 (Fed. Cir. 2009), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was the subject of commentary in the Federal Circuit's decision in a patent case, <span class="Italic">Micron Technology, Inc. v. Rambus, Inc.,</span> 645 F.3d 1311, 1329-31 (Fed. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Piercing of the Attorney-Client Privilege</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court's spoliation rulings depended in part on evidence from communications between Rambus and its attorneys; these communications were in the record only because they had been ordered produced by Rambus after the district court pierced the attorney-client privilege that otherwise would protect the communications from disclosure. Rambus appeals the privilege-piercing ruling, arguing that the district court erred by finding that Micron had made the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that Rambus had committed or intended to commit a fraud or crime and that the attorney-client communications in question were in furtherance of that crime or fraud.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rambus is correct that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege requires such a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing. <span class="Italic">In re Grand Jury Subpoena</span>, 223 F.3d 213, 217 (3d Cir. 2000). But making a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is "not a particularly heavy" burden, <span class="Italic">In re Grand Jury Investigation</span>, 445 F.3d 266, 274-75 (3d Cir. 2006), and this court agrees with the district court that Micron did indeed carry that burden here. Specifically, there was enough evidence to find a likely violation of &#x00A7; 135 of the California Penal Code, which provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[e]very person who, knowing that any book, paper, record, instrument in writing or other matter or thing is about to be produced in evidence upon any trial, inquiry, or investigation whatever, authorized by law, willfully destroys or conceals the same, with intent thereby to prevent it from being produced, is guilty of a misdemeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, there is ample evidence that Rambus destroyed documents in its possession knowing that they would likely be forced to be produced in litigation and intending to prevent that production. There is also ample evidence that Rambus devised this strategy partly on the basis of the advice it received from its outside counsel. The only question therefore is whether the documents Rambus destroyed were "about to be produced in evidence," or whether the delay of some months between Rambus's destruction of the evidence and Rambus's final decision to file suit against Hitachi eliminates any possibility that this element of the California statute could be satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rambus argues that the "about to be produced in evidence" element of &#x00A7; 135 has been interpreted to "connote[&#8197;] an immediacy or temporal closeness" between the destruction of the evidence and the time when it was to be produced and that such "temporal closeness" is missing here. <span class="Italic">People v. Prysock</span>, 127 Cal. App. 3d 972, 1000-01 (Cal. App. 5th Dist. 1982). However, <span class="Italic">Prysock</span> is distinguishable. There, the criminal defendant committed murder and, shortly thereafter, burned the clothes he wore while committing the crime. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 981. Because no "law enforcement investigation...had started" at the time the defendant destroyed his <span id="Page_1252"></span>clothes, and because "law enforcement was [not]...looking for the" clothes at the time they were destroyed, the California court found no violation of &#x00A7; 135. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1001. In <span class="Italic">Prysock</span>, then, the defendant controlled the timing of the destruction of relevant evidence, while law enforcement, acting independently, controlled the timing of the initiation of the investigation that would trigger the application of &#x00A7; 135. Here, by contrast, Rambus controlled the timing of both events. It would make no sense to allow Rambus to escape liability, criminal or otherwise, by intentionally destroying evidence and then waiting for an arbitrary period of time before choosing to file suit. Moreover, it is not clear that California courts would interpret the statute in such a way as to make the initiation of the "investigation" the time when Rambus filed its complaint. Instead, the statute could just as reasonably be interpreted such that it would be violated by the intentional destruction of evidence at any time after Rambus began preparing to file this suit. Interpreted this way, Rambus's preparations to file this suit in early 1998 began the civil equivalent of the criminal law-enforcement investigation in <span class="Italic">Prysock</span>, and Rambus's destruction of documents in late 1998 and 1999 violated &#x00A7; 135 if, as noted above, Rambus intentionally destroyed those documents with the intention of keeping them from being produced in the ensuing litigation. This is clearly a different situation from that encountered in <span class="Italic">Prysock</span>, and this court sees no error in the district court's distinguishing that case. Because the district court properly found that Micron made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that (1) Rambus willfully destroyed documents it knew would have to be produced in the litigation it intended to initiate against Hitachi, (2) Rambus destroyed those documents in order to keep them from being produced, and (3) Rambus began destroying those documents based on communications from its litigation counsel advising it to begin destroying discoverable information, this court agrees with the district court's use of the crime-fraud exception to pierce the attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The attorney-client privilege is not to be used improperly to shield material from discovery, that is, it is not to be established as an artifice to avoid disclosing materials that were not legitimately involved in provision of legal advice. <span class="Italic">Shibuya v. USDA</span>, 119 MSPR 537, 546-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17, 2013 MSPB 44 (2013), sustained a misconduct charge based on an employee's attempt to use attorney-client privilege only to avoid disclosure of documents that were otherwise discoverable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that he engaged Mr. Wiley to review case analyses drafted by agency employees for the purpose of asserting an attorney-client or work-product privilege in order to prevent the disclosure of case analyses in future third-party proceedings. In his response to the notice of proposed demotion, the appellant merely alleged that "the very act of shielding case analyses from discovery" is not unlawful and that "[f]ollowing the advice of a contract attorney cannot constitute conduct unbecoming a Federal employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding purpose of the arrangement, the record contains an email dated September 6, 2008, in which Mr. Wiley stated that "[s]ince we have this standing contract, you might as well take advantage of my lawyer-ness." He informed the appellant that he would only make comments that were "absolutely necessary," that his review "shouldn't cost more than a couple of tenths of an hour," and that charging the agency for his review would "remove any doubt that this is an official lawyer-client relationship.... That's a cheap easy procedure to keep a critical document away from the dark side." Mr. Wiley further advised the appellant that case analyses should be emailed to him so that the documents could be issued with an attorney-client privilege statement. We find that the weight of the record evidence supports the agency's position that the purpose of Mr. Wiley's review was to prevent the disclosure of case analyses drafted by agency employees in future third-party proceedings by creating the appearance that the case analyses were privileged documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for whether the arrangement was inappropriate, we find that it contravenes the agency's obligation during litigation to disclose non-privileged, discoverable information when requested by the other party, and not to fabricate a privilege in order to prevent the discovery of information. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) and (b)(5)(B). Attorney-client privilege exists for the sake of the attorney-client relationship--not the other way around. <span class="Italic">See Fisher v. United States</span>, 425 U.S. 391 (1976) (the purpose of attorney-client privilege is to encourage clients to make full disclosure to their attorneys, and it only applies where necessary to achieve that purpose). We find that this scheme was an abuse of the privilege and that the agency was right to be concerned by it. The Board takes the integrity of its discovery process seriously. We do not condone the specious "attorney-client relationship" that the appellant and Mr. Wiley cooked up in order to play some procedural game with our administrative judges. We find that the arrangement was inappropriate, and we SUSTAIN charge 2.</p>
