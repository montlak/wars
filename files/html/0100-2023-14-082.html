<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-81"><span class="space">f.</span> Positions of Similar Levels of Trust and Responsibility</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">After the 2010 <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> decision, supra, the Board has not fully articulated how comparisons are properly drawn between employees serving at different levels of organizations. Noting the relevance of a comparison between comparable misconduct by the appellant, who was not a supervisor, and a facility supervisor, <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 457, 465-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16, 2013 MSPB 100 (2013), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, the Board found that the alleged comparator in that case was similarly-situated to Boucher, although the comparator committed his misconduct several years before Boucher's misconduct at a different location, and the alleged comparator's misconduct was more serious than Boucher's misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Boucher,</span> 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 22. Similarly, in this case, the Maintenance Manager's unacceptable conduct was arguably more serious than the appellant's unacceptable conduct, because the Maintenance Manager was a supervisory employee and his misconduct involved multiple incidents over the course of several months. The Board has held that if an appellant could show that supervisory employees--who are held to a higher standard--were treated less harshly by the agency than the agency treated the appellant for similar misconduct, then the appellant would have met his disparate penalty burden and triggered the agency's burden to explain the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 119 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 11 (2013) (citations omitted). The appellant has made that initial showing here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, however, we find that the agency met its burden of proving that it had a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment between these employees. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 24. The agency provided evidence that the appellant's unacceptable conduct, unlike that of the Maintenance Manager, placed employees in fear for their safety. Moreover, the agency specified that the appellant's unacceptable conduct violated the agency's zero tolerance policy, unlike that of the Maintenance Manager. Another significant distinction is that the Maintenance Manager had approximately 29 years of service with the agency, in contrast to the appellant's 6 years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an agency is not foreclosed from proffering evidence that the penalty for a certain offense was too lenient in the past. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 27. The deciding official credibly testified that he considered whether the appellant's penalty was consistent with penalties imposed on others for similar offenses in his penalty determination, and that he was unaware of any similarly-situated individuals. In explaining why the removal penalty was appropriate in the appellant's case, considering his lack of prior discipline and years of service, the deciding official testified that he decided against imposing a lesser penalty because he was not convinced that the appellant would not engage in the same serious misconduct with his own supervisors in the future. The deciding official further testified that he was unfamiliar with the Maintenance Manager or the circumstances of his discipline, but that he would have removed the Maintenance Manager if he had been the deciding official in that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the deciding official considered the consistency of the penalty as required by <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, and that preponderant evidence justifies the difference in treatment between the appellant and the Maintenance Manager for their unacceptable conduct. Removal is within the range of penalties for unacceptable conduct in violation of the agency's zero tolerance policy, and the appellant's 6 years of service and lack of prior disciplinary history does not outweigh the seriousness of his offense. An employee's verbal threat to a supervisor is without question a serious offense. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 678, 679 (1986) (sustaining the removal of an appellant who threatened a supervisor, despite the appellant's lack of prior discipline and 4 years of service), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 809 F.2d 792 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table). Such behavior affects the agency's obligation to maintain a safe work place for its employees, thus impinging upon the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board directed that the agency produce in discovery records relating to the discipline of both supervisors and line employees who made false statements on a SF-86 form (security questionnaire) in <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. DHS</span>, 119 MSPR 422, 425, 427-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 9-11, 2013 MSPB 33 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), except to the extent the decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal of his removal, seeking mitigation of the penalty. The appellant argued that he received a harsher penalty than other agency employees who had engaged in more serious misconduct. In accordance with the procedures set forth in the administrative judge's acknowledgment order, the appellant timely initiated discovery. His discovery requests included the following request for the production of documents:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">All proposal notices, decision notices, settlement agreements, arbitration awards, last chance agreements or firm choice agreements relating to disciplinary and/or adverse action cases within the Agency nationwide for the past five years relating to any allegation of "Falsification" and/or similar allegations as those in this issue in this appeal for any Agency employee, including supervisors. Please include all settlement agreements. The documents may be provided in sanitized format.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discovery is the process by which a party may obtain relevant information from another party to an appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a). "Relevant information includes information that appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What constitutes relevant information in discovery is to be liberally interpreted, and uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the movant absent any undue delay or hardship caused by such request. <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 27, &#x00B6; 15 (2009). "The scope of discovery is broad: '[d]iscovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal....'" <span class="Italic">Baird v. Department of the Army</span>, 517 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(b)). The Board will not reverse an administrative judge's rulings on discovery matters absent an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Wagner v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 447, 452 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge denied the appellant's request for documentation relating to disciplinary actions imposed on supervisory employees for the same or similar misconduct as the appellant because he found it did not appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. We find that such a result is contrary to our instructions in recent cases that have held that a flexible approach is warranted when considering the consistency of the penalty with those imposed on comparator employees. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15; <span class="Italic">see Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (2012). Specifically, the Board has held that, to establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors." <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15. If an appellant does so, the agency must then prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's document request relating to potential comparator supervisory employees was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Specifically, if the appellant could show that supervisory employees--who are held to a higher standard[3] --were treated less harshly by the agency than the agency treated the appellant for similar misconduct, the appellant would have met his disparate penalty burden and triggered the agency's burden to explain the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 15 (2012), the Board held that a supervisory agricultural specialist was not similarly situated for disparate penalty purposes to the non-supervisory agricultural specialist appellant, <span class="Italic">not</span> because the alleged comparator was a supervisor, but because the alleged comparator was unaware of his obligation to cooperate in an investigation, and fully cooperated once he became so aware. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge abused his discretion in denying the appellant's motion to compel on the grounds that materials relating to supervisory employees did not appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Deas v. Department of Transportation</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 637, &#x00B6; 20 (2008); <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Department of the Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Agencies are entitled to hold supervisors to a higher standard than non-supervisors because they occupy positions of trust and responsibility. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 173, &#x00B6; 14 (2010</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall permit further discovery by the appellant regarding disciplinary actions imposed on supervisory employees for engaging in the same or similar misconduct as the appellant. After the completion of discovery, the administrative judge shall provide the parties the opportunity to submit supplemental evidence and argument with respect to the appellant's disparate penalty claim, including the reconvening of the hearing, if requested, and shall issue a new initial decision addressing the reasonableness of the penalty, consistent with this Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McGrath</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Robbins concurred in <span class="Italic">Figueroa,</span> 119 MSPR 422, 429 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I concur with the disposition of this case. The precedents cited are controlling and I believe they are being applied correctly. I write separately, however, because this case once again illustrates my concerns with the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268 (2010) and <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657 (2010), which in my opinion relaxed the long-established, well-understood and easily managed test for impermissible disparity in penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As I said in my dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640 (2012), the Civil Service Reform Act's scheme for employee discipline should tolerate localized or organizational differences in penalties, so long as the penalty in any particular case is reasonable and consistent under the balancing of all appropriate <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 2010, comparison was generally conducted within the work force among those of equivalent positions of trust and responsibility. If the appellant held a special position of trust and that trust is violated, the offense may be considered more serious than that of another individual whose position does not involve the same degree of trust. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 493, 498 (2004) (distinguishing treatment of individuals holding the same job description but having supervisory responsibility over different classifications of employees); <span class="Italic">Holliman v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 372, 376 (1997) (postmaster was held to a higher level of trust than lower-level, nonpostmaster supervisors); <span class="Italic">Baracker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 594, 606 (1996) (disparity of penalty argument unavailing to a member of the SES held to "a very high standard of conduct"); <span class="Italic">Aliota v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 491, 497-98 (1994) (subordinate's alleged misconduct was not evidence of a disparity in penalty meted out to a supervisor in a higher position of trust); <span class="Italic">Shatzel v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 451, 454 (1991) (supervisor who discarded undeliverable mail was not similarly situated to letter carriers who committed the same offense); <span class="Italic">Facer v.

Cir. 1988) (allowing a difference in penalties for employees who held nonsensitive positions and an employee in a sensitive aircraft mechanic position who was found to have used marijuana on base during off-duty hours);<span class="Italic"> cf. Rohn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 157 (1986) (secretary-timekeeper was removed for submitting false timecards; distinguishing cases involving other employees who were involved in improper entries on timecards).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But there is to be some legitimate difference in employees' positions to excuse abstention from disparate treatment analysis. When employees hired under one procedure were given warnings for possession of unauthorized firearms on agency premises, and the appellant, hired under a different procedure, was removed for the offense, the Board considered the penalty of removal unreasonable and substituted a written warning. <span class="Italic">Washington v. TVA</span>, 8 MSPR 27, 30, 7 MSPB 525 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf. Johnson v. SSA</span>, 6 MSPR 207, 209, 6 MSPB 182 (1981) (disparity analysis was unavailing in a Chapter 75 performance-based case when production statistics reflected the average production of modules (including trainees and journeymen) and did not correspond to individual benefit authorizers). Similar offenses of journeymen and a supervisor were comparable if the supervisor was performing as a journeyman outside of his supervisory field. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. DHUD</span>, 26 MSPR 356, 359 (1985) (appellant, although a supervisor of a multifamily housing branch, was performing work <span id="Page_2395"></span>as an appraiser, a job he held in the distant past but not in a supervisory role).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 2010 there were decisions comparing penalties between unit employees and supervisors. <span class="Italic">See Lynch v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 33, 40 (1986) (vehicle misuse; rejecting an agency defense that it investigated the supervisor's conduct but had not yet reached a decision on the matter); <span class="Italic">Woodard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 614, 617 (1984) (fighting); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 585, 587-88 (1981) (comparing an adverse action against the appellant, and admonishment of a supervisor, for abusive language; distinctions in the service history and the past disciplinary record of the two employees did not justify the "great difference in treatment"); <span class="Italic">cf. North Germany Area Council, Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 805 F.2d 1044 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (assertion of disparity in penalties; examining the relevance of a union request for information about the agency's treatment of supervisors in disciplinary cases within the work unit). In <span class="Italic">Lynch v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 33, 40 (1986), the appellant was disciplined for, among other things, vehicle misuse. His supervisor apparently engaged in the same conduct but was not disciplined. The Board noted with disapproval that the agency had not acted against the supervisor. The agency explained that it had investigated the supervisor's conduct but had not reached a decision. The Board found disparate treatment because "the agency did not present evidence to the administrative judge to explain its apparent difference in treatment of the appellant and the supervisor." Whether the agency's explanation was insufficient as a matter of law or just not sufficiently detailed was not stated. [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>, "<a href="0100-2023-13-144.html#sec6-143"><span class="Italic">Respondeat Superior</span></a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Distinctions in the levels of positions could serve to justify disparities in penalties. An appellant was demoted and suspended because, as housing director, he failed to ensure that a grantee's application was properly processed by subordinates. He claimed in defense that if he was responsible, so was the area manager, who was his supervisor. The Board considered the defense to be unpersuasive: the appellant was responsible for his program, one requiring considerable expertise, while the area manager was more of a generalist with responsibility for many programs. The area manager, not being a subject matter expert and not having knowledge of any improprieties, did not share appellant's responsibility for the improper processing of the grantee's application. The disparity was not established by evidence that the area manager received no discipline. <span class="Italic">Mayfield v. DHUD</span>, 23 MSPR 217, 222 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not compare a penalty meted out to a civilian employee with the penalty to military personnel involved in similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Boyer v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3032) (see concurring opinion of Judge Plager, [noted in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-168.html#sec8-167">Charges Based upon Agency Regulations or Standards of Conduct Not Specifically Tied to Title VII</a>," comparing military and civil service standards of conduct] ); <span class="Italic">Sherwin v.
