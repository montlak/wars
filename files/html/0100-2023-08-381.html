<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-373"><span class="space">d.</span> Position Announced Under Both Open Competition and Merit Promotion Procedures</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30 (2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, changed preexisting law concerning rights of federal employees to receive veterans preference when they apply for other federal positions. The decisions that follow should be considered in the context of the 2022 <span class="Italic">Oram</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Graf v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 111 MSPR 444, 447 n.1, 2009 MSPB 106 (2009), distinguished application of veterans preference to examination procedures used by agencies for competitive and merit promotion selections:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the AJ advised the parties that the appellant was required to show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency denied her the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its workforce. However, there are two primary types of selection processes in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101<span class="Italic"> et seq.</span> One type of selection process is the "merit promotion" process, which is used when an agency announces a position only to those already employed in the agency or in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Abell v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Preference eligibles and certain other veterans may apply to fill vacancies under merit promotion procedures when an agency accepts applications from individuals outside its own workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). However, an employee is not entitled to veterans' preference in the merit promotion process. <span class="Italic">Perkins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9. The other selection process is the competitive examination process, which is generally required for entry into the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An integral part of the examining process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates according to those scores. <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 2 n.* (2008); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a). Preference-eligible veterans are entitled to five additional points, and disabled veterans, as well as certain relatives of disabled veterans are entitled to ten additional points, which are added to their passing examination scores. <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6; 2 n.*; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(b). In this instance, the vacancy announcements clearly stated that applications would be accepted from "United States citizens and nationals." Additionally, the vacancy announcements provided that the candidates would be scored, rated, and ranked, with veterans' preference given when appropriate. Thus, the vacancy announcements were to be filled under the open competitive examination process. Accordingly, the AJ erred in finding that this was a merit promotion selection process, and that the appellant had to show that the agency denied her the opportunity to compete under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McPeak v. VA,</span> NY-3330-10-0062-I-1 (NP 11/12/2010), summarized application of veterans preference when the agency uses merit promotion and open competition procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review that the agency violated her veterans' preference rights by hiring another individual off of a certificate of eligibles that did not contain her name. However, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency's action did not violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. An agency is permitted to announce a single vacancy under both merit promotion and open competitive examining procedures simultaneously, and it is permitted to make a selection from either certificate. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6; 11 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101. The agency's decision to do so does not violate the veterans' preference rights of the individuals on the certificate from which it did not make its selection. <span class="Italic">See Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 548 F.3d 1370, 1372-74 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency violated her veterans' preference rights by advertising the Addiction Therapist vacancy in an unnecessarily confusing manner. She asserts that the agency lacks a consistent policy for posting open competitive announcements to the VA Upstate NY Jobs website, that the information on the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 2 website was misleading, that the USAJobs website is difficult to use, and that the agency should have done a better job of informing her that she would need to monitor both VA Upstate NY Jobs and USAJobs for the vacancy announcements at issue. The appellant has filed documentary evidence in support of her allegations. All of the appellant's allegations may be true, and the agency itself has admitted that it could have done a better job announcing the vacancy at issue. Nevertheless, the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) only authorizes the Board to order corrective action when an agency violates a preference eligible individual's right "under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1). The appellant has not identified a specific veterans' preference <span id="Page_717"></span>statute or regulation that the agency may have violated, and we agree with the administrative judge that, under the specific facts of this case, including the explicit notice to the appellant to monitor both websites, the agency's failure to advertise the vacancy clearly does not violate any specific veterans' preference law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the administrative judge did not consider the case law that she cited below. We note that the administrative judge cited one of those cases extensively in his initial decision. However, we have considered both of the cases, and we find that they do not support the appellant's position. Like the appellant in this case, the appellants in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-5, and <span class="Italic">Dean v.

However, the Board denied corrective action in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span> because it found that the practice was permissible. 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 15. The Board ordered corrective action in <span class="Italic">Dean</span> because it found that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights. 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 46. However, in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights by appointing another individual to the position for which the appellant applied without going through the required competitive examining procedures. 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-38. In this case, there is no dispute that the individual whom the agency ultimately appointed to the Addiction Therapist position passed a competitive examination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without violating VEOA the agency may announce a position under open competitive and merit promotion procedures and then decide to use merit promotion procedures, with the effect that an applicant who likely would have been chosen, if not passed over, on a competitive list, is not selected through merit promotion, <span class="Italic">Joseph v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 2004, the agency announced a vacancy for the position of Paralegal Specialist, GS-0950-09. The announcement indicated that the vacancy was open to all qualified candidates, status and non-status, and further stated that, if candidates wished to be considered under both merit promotion and competitive procedures, they must either submit two applications or indicate their desire to be considered under both procedures.[1] The appellant, a 10-point disabled veteran, submitted an application and stated that he wished to be considered under both merit promotion and competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The term "status candidate" refers to applicants with "competitive status." "Competitive status" is eligibility for appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination, and ordinarily is acquired by completing probation under a career conditional appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.3(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the vacancy announcement closed, the agency evaluated all applications using a rating plan. Based on the rating plan, the appellant was assigned a numerical rating of 92 points, or 102 points with 10 points added for veterans' preference. The eventual selectee, Cheryl Thomas, received a rating of 90. Using merit promotion procedures, the agency prepared a certificate including the candidates with the four highest numerical ratings, without the application of veterans' preference, listed in alphabetical order. The appellant and Ms. Thomas were both listed on the merit promotion certificate. The agency also issued a Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) certificate using competitive procedures. Based on his numerical rating, the appellant was listed first on the DEU certificate, along with his score and the notation "CPS," indicating that he had received 10 additional points because of his veterans' preference. Ms. Thomas was not among the candidates listed on the DEU certificate. In addition to the merit promotion and DEU certificates, the agency issued a Non-Competitive Eligible Certificate, which listed one applicant eligible for selection without competition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency elected to choose a candidate from the merit promotion certificate, and conducted interviews with the candidates listed on the certificate, including the appellant. The selecting official ultimately chose Ms. Thomas, an internal candidate without veterans' preference. The agency notified the appellant of his non-selection by letter dated November 8, 2004.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the VEOA, the Board is empowered to adjudicate a claim that an agency violated "any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1), (d)(1). The Veterans' Preference Act and related regulations confer several advantages on preference eligibles when an agency conducts a competitive examination with the intention of filling a position in the competitive service.[3] A competitive examination is not required, however, when an agency selects an internal candidate, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, someone who is already on its employment rolls, under "merit promotion" procedures. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;An integral part of the competitive examining process is the assignment of numerical scores, followed by the rating and ranking of candidates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3309; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.101(a) (the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or an agency operating under a delegation of authority from OPM, "shall assign numerical ratings" to candidates).

After the candidates' scores have been adjusted to include any additional points, the names of applicants who have qualified for appointment are entered onto "registers or lists of eligibles," in rank order, with preference eligibles ranked ahead of others with the same rating. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. For positions other than scientific and professional positions in grades GS-9 or higher, disabled veterans who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are entered onto registers in order of their ratings ahead of all remaining applicants. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.401. An examining authority certifies "enough names from the top of the appropriate register" to permit the appointing authority "to consider at least three names for appointment to each vacancy in the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3317(a). The appointing authority "shall select for appointment to each vacancy from the highest three eligibles available for appointment on the certificate furnished under section 3317(a)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a). If an appointing authority "proposes to pass over a preference eligible...in order to select an individual who is not a preference eligible, such authority shall file written reasons with [OPM] for passing over the preference eligible" and obtain OPM's approval. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Central to the ALJ's conclusion that the appellant should have received preference over Ms. Thomas, a non-preference eligible internal candidate, is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (f)(1) "shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(3). The ALJ reasoned that since 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) guaranteed the appellant the right to "compete" for the Paralegal Specialist position, a determination that he was entitled to veterans' preference was not giving him a preference "not otherwise required." Rather, according to the ALJ, the appellant is entitled to preference in a competitive examination, and section 3304(f)(1) requires a competitive examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree because OPM reasonably interprets section 3304(f)(1) as merely conferring on preference eligibles and certain other veterans the right to be considered alongside internal candidates under merit promotion procedures.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The open competitive examination generally is used for employees seeking to join the competitive service and often is used for reviewing applicants outside the agency. Under this process, applicants for employment are given a numerical rating and placed on a list of qualified personnel for appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner Devon Joseph, a veteran employed by another federal agency, applied for the position and requested that he be considered under both procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission evaluated and rated all of the applicants under both procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission then prepared a merit promotion list that alphabetically listed the four applicants with the highest numerical ratings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission decided to make the appointment from the merit promotion list. It interviewed the four candidates on that list, including Joseph, and selected Ms. Thomas, a non-veteran. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After unsuccessfully challenging his non-appointment before the Department of Labor, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330(a)(1), as violating his veterans' preference rights, Joseph appealed his non-selection to the Board. Because he was a Board employee, the Board referred the complaint to the National Labor Relations Board for adjudication by one of that agency's administrative law judges. In his initial decision the administrative law judge sustained Joseph's contention and ordered his selection. The Board, however, reversed. The Board held that Joseph</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">received veterans' preference in the competitive examination that the agency used to assess external candidates for the Paralegal Specialist position. The appellant did not receive veterans' preference in the concurrent assessment that the agency conducted under merit promotion procedures, but as explained above, an individual is not entitled to veterans' preference under merit promotion procedures. <span class="Italic">See Perkins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 9. The ALJ committed a clear error of law in concluding that the appellant's veterans' preference rights were violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 688.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Joseph does not challenge the Commission's simultaneous use of the open competition examination process (in which his veterans' ten-point preference was recognized) and the merit promotion process (in which that preference was not recognized) to fill a single position. He challenges only the way the Commission used the two processes to make its selection. He contends that having conducted the open competition process, in which he was at the top of the list after receiving a ten point veterans' preference, the Commission could not then make its selection from the merit process list, which did not reflect his veterans' preference. Such selection, he contends, denied him his preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory and regulatory provisions defining veterans' rights in seeking and obtaining federal employment require rejection of this contention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The addition of points to a veteran's score because of his status applies only in the open competition examination process and not in the merit appointment process. The Commission fully recognized Joseph's veterans' preference in the competitive examination process when it added ten-points to his score because he was a disabled veteran. If the Commission had made its selection by that process, presumably it would have selected Joseph, unless it had obtained OPM authority to choose someone else.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission, however, made the appointment not under that process but under the merit promotion process, in which the requirement to appoint a veteran who is at the top of the list did not apply. The question is whether the provisions governing veterans' rights under merit promotion procedures precluded the Commission from doing so. The answer is no.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the statutes governing open competition applicants, under which a veteran's numerical rating is increased because of his status and a veteran ordinarily is appointed if he is at the top of the list, Congress adopted a different approach in dealing with veterans and merit promotion. It guaranteed veterans only a right to apply and an opportunity to compete for such positions. It said nothing about the basis upon which the agency could make its selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical statutory provision is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), which was added to the veterans statutes by the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 ("VEOA"). It provides that "all merit promotion announcements...shall indicate that...veterans...are eligible to apply..." and that specified categories of veterans</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency...will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All that this latter provision entitles veterans to is "the opportunity to compete for vacant positions" to be filled "under merit promotion procedures." Indeed, the same statute also provides that this "opportunity to compete" provision "shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans' preference that is not otherwise required by law." As the Board has correctly pointed out, "an employee is not entitled to veterans' preference in the merit promotion process." <span class="Italic">Perkins</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. at 51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Joseph was given a full "opportunity to compete" in the merit selection process by which the appointment was made. He filed his application, and he was one of four applicants who qualified for final consideration. He, like the other three in that group, was interviewed before the final selection was made. The fact that he was not selected does not mean that he did not have a full "opportunity to compete"; it means only that, after such competition, he was not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Joseph received his ten point veterans' preference under the competitive examination procedure, but the Commission then decided to make the appointment under the alternative merit promotion procedure. We know of no statute or regulatory provision that required the Commission, once it undertook to inaugurate the selection process by following the alternative procedure, to limit itself to the competitive examination process in making its final selection. As the Board pointed out in this case, "[a]n agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101; <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208, &#x00B6; 10 (2001)." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. at 689. Joseph's argument <span id="Page_719"></span>would preclude the agency from using the selection process that it deems most suitable for filling the particular vacancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court rejected a comparable attempt to invalidate a non-appointment because it denied veterans' preference rights in <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 343 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003). There the Navy announced three vacancies for the same position and that it would consider applications under both merit promotion and competitive examination procedures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380. Abell, a veteran, applied for any one of those positions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Navy appointed other applicants to two of the positions--one under the merit promotion process and the other under the competitive examination process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381. It then cancelled the third vacancy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Abell challenged the Navy's cancellation of the third vacancy as violating his veterans' preference rights because such action denied him the opportunity to compete for that position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381-82. We sustained the Navy's action. We "h[e]ld that Mr. Abell was not denied his opportunity to compete by virtue of the Navy's decision to cancel the vacancy announcement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1384. We explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The VEOA required that the Navy give Mr. Abell the opportunity to compete for the three vacant positions; the VEOA did not require that the Navy give Mr. Abell a position if he scored the most points. The Navy reasonably relied on its interview process to determine that Mr. Abell did not meet the qualifications required for the position. In short, Mr. Abell had the opportunity to compete and did compete; the Navy's decision not to fill the position did not violate Mr. Abell's rights under the VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1384-85.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similar reasoning applies in this case and requires the same conclusion. Although the issue in <span class="Italic">Abell</span> was the Navy's right to cancel the third vacancy after filling the other two, there are significant similarities between that case and the present one. In both cases the agency conducted simultaneous parallel procedures under the competitive examination and merit promotion processes to fill the same position. In both cases the alleged violation of the veteran's preference stems from the agency's failure to appoint the veteran to a position he sought--in <span class="Italic">Abell</span> by canceling the position, and in the present case by making the selection under the merit promotion process, in which someone other than the veteran was selected. In both cases the dispositive issue is whether the employing agency denied the applicant the opportunity to compete. Just as the Navy did not deny such an opportunity when it cancelled the third vacancy, so the Commission also did not deny the opportunity to compete by selecting another applicant under its merit promotion process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By changing a few words to reflect the different facts in the present case, the following statement from the <span class="Italic">Abell</span> opinion quoted above is equally applicable in the present case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [Commission] gave Mr. [Joseph] the opportunity to compete for the...vacant position[;] the VEOA did not require that the [Commission] give Mr. [Joseph] a position if he scored the most points.... In short, Mr. [Joseph] had the opportunity to compete and did compete; the [Commission's] decision.... to fill the position [through the merit system rather than through the competitive process] did not violate Mr. [Joseph's] rights under the VEOA.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joseph</span> was explained by <span class="Italic">MacLeod v. VA</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. 962, 963-66 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MacLeod is the wife of a service-connected disabled veteran. Her husband has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. MacLeod is therefore "preference eligible" under the VEOA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 23, 2006, the Veterans Administration ("VA") issued two announcements for the position of Voluntary Services Officer (GS-301-13) in the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. The first announcement was entitled "PROMOTION ANNOUNCEMENT" and stated that it was "a solicitation for applications from current VA employees for competitive promotion consideration." The Promotion Announcement indicated that it was "OPEN TO ALL SOURCES," meaning that certain eligible non-VA employees could apply, including applicants eligible as a result of "special appointing authorities such as those for disabled veterans." The second announcement was entitled "VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT," stated that it was "OPEN TO ALL US CITIZENS," and was posted on the USAJOBS website.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MacLeod submitted an application in response to the Vacancy Announcement. The VA issued three separate Merit Promotion Certificates listing candidates who were qualified for the Voluntary Services Officer position, either because they were current VA employees eligible for promotion or transfer, or because they were "preference eligible" under the VEOA. MacLeod's name appeared on one of these certificates. The VA also generated a Certificate of Eligibles, listing three candidates for the position who were neither current VA employees nor otherwise eligible to apply under the Promotion Announcement, but who could have applied under the Vacancy Announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA interviewed and rated the candidates and did not select MacLeod for the position. Instead, the VA selected a current VA employee who transferred from a different VA facility. This selection was reflected on a Merit Promotion Certificate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MacLeod filed a complaint under the VEOA with the Department of Labor. The Department found her complaint to be without merit, and MacLeod appealed to the Board.... MacLeod petitioned this court for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, "[f]ederal agencies generally use two types of selection to fill vacancies: (1) the open 'competitive examination' process and (2) the 'merit promotion' process." 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.101, 332.101, 335.103 (2007)). The "competitive examination" process is typically open to the public and is used to select and review applicants who are not currently agency employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> By contrast, "[t]he merit promotion process is used when the position is to be filled by an employee of the agency or by an applicant from outside the agency who has 'status' in the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1382 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Veterans and other "preference eligible" persons under the VEOA are given special advantages in <span class="Italic">both</span> the "competitive examination" process and the "merit promotion" process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381-82. However, the type of advantage that the veteran or "preference eligible" person receives depends on which process is used. In the "competitive examination" process, additional points are added to the final rating scores of "preference eligible" applicants, and "preference eligible" applicants are ranked ahead of other applicants who have the same score. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381. By contrast, in the "merit promotion" process, the special advantage that a "preference eligible" person gets is simply the "opportunity to apply" for vacancies that are otherwise open only to current agency employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress has provided...that "for all merit promotion announcements...veterans...are eligible to apply." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(3)-(4). Veterans "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1382; <span class="Italic">see also Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1383 ("The VEOA ensures that a preference eligible veteran...has the opportunity to apply for [merit promotion] vacancies.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have expressly held that when an agency uses the "merit promotion" process, a "preference eligible" person is entitled <span class="Italic">only</span> to the right to compete, not to the point and ranking preferences that would have applied if the agency had used the "competitive examination" process. <span class="Italic">See Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1382 ("Veterans' point preferences under the competitive appointment process do not apply in the merit promotion process."); <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1383 ("In other words, the VEOA gave [the veteran] the right to apply for the three vacant positions announced by the [agency] . However, the VEOA did not ensure that his application would be successful.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_720"></span>Moreover, an agency is permitted to seek applicants for a position under both the "merit promotion" procedure and the "competitive examination" procedure, but then ultimately fill the position using the "merit promotion" procedure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The veteran] received his ten point veterans' preference under the competitive examination procedure, but the [agency] then decided to make the appointment under the alternative merit promotion procedure. We know of no statute or regulatory provision that required the [agency], once it undertook to inaugurate the selection process by following the alternative procedure, to limit itself to the competitive examination process in making its final selection. As the Board pointed out in this case, "[a]n agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1384 (quoting <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Fed. Trade Comm'n</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, 689 (2006)). When an agency conducts "simultaneous parallel procedures under the competitive examination and merit promotion processes" but ultimately fills the position using the "merit promotion" process, a "preference eligible" person is entitled only to the opportunity to compete, not to point or ranking preferences. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1384-85; <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, 343 F.3d at 1383.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is clear from the record that the VA ultimately filled the Voluntary Services Officer position using the "merit promotion" process, not the "competitive examination" process. Specifically, the Promotion Announcement demonstrated the VA's intent to proceed under the "merit promotion" process, and the VA finalized its selection of a candidate by issuing a Merit Promotion Certificate that listed qualified candidates "[i]n accordance with the procedures of the Merit Promotion Plan." The VA therefore satisfied its obligations under the VEOA by allowing MacLeod to compete in the "merit promotion" process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered each of MacLeod's arguments to the contrary but do not find them persuasive. We briefly address three of those arguments here. First, MacLeod argues that the Vacancy Announcement posted on USAJOBS demonstrates that the VA was proceeding under the "competitive examination" process, because it was listed as "OPEN TO ALL US CITIZENS." At most, this second announcement shows that the VA used "simultaneous parallel procedures under the competitive examination and merit promotion processes." <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1384. It does not change the fact that the VA ultimately used the "merit promotion" process to fill the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, relying on <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 247 F.3d 1222 (Fed. Cir. 2001), MacLeod argues that a "preference eligible" person "seeking initial appointment or retention in employment" is entitled to preferential treatment over an existing agency employee seeking a transfer or promotion. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1223 ("The AJ concluded that veterans receive preference only when 'seeking initial appointment or retention in employment.'"). <span class="Italic">Brown</span> held simply that a "preference eligible" person that is already employed by an agency is not entitled to preferential treatment when seeking promotion or retention. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1224. It said nothing about the comparative treatment of "preference eligible" non-employees and agency employees seeking to compete for a position under the "merit promotion" process. As we held in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, the point and ranking preferences to which a "preference eligible" person is entitled when "seeking initial appointment" are only applicable when an agency uses "competitive examination" to fill a position. 505 F.3d at 1382.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joseph</span> and the use of alternative selection routes were again reviewed, <span class="Italic">Ferrell v. DHUD</span>, DA-3330-13-0130-I-1 (NP 7/24/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments are unavailing. The Board's reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has held that an agency does not violate an applicant's veterans' preference rights when it fills a vacancy from a merit promotion certificate even when it has concurrently accepted applications under an announcement advertising that competitive-examination procedures will be used to fill the vacancy. <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.102 ("An agency may fill a vacancy in the competitive service by any method authorized in this chapter, including competitive appointment from a list of eligibles, noncompetitive appointment under special authority, reinstatement, transfer, reassignment, change to lower grade, or promotion."). Like the appellant, the applicant in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span> applied under both announcements. <span class="Italic">See Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1382. He was ranked first under the competitive-examination procedures after his veterans' preference points were added, but a nonveteran candidate who was only on the merit promotion certificate was selected. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The court explained that it knew of "no statute or regulatory provision that required the [agency], once it undertook to inaugurate the selection process by following the alternative procedure, to limit itself to the competitive examination process in making its final selection." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1384. The category rating procedures, including the listing of preference eligibles ahead of the other applicants in each rating category, are competitive-examination procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(a), (b). Any errors that the appellant alleges concerning category rating are thus immaterial to the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once more <span class="Italic">Joseph</span> was applied, <span class="Italic">Jolley v. MSPB</span>, 752 Fed. Appx. 964, 967-68 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP), considering both VEOA and USERRA claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as to Mr. Jolley's attack against the use of "dual announcements" to fill a vacancy, we have already decided that dual announcements comply with both the VEOA and USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Joseph v. FTC</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that the use of dual announcements does not violate the VEOA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, federal agencies generally use two types of selection to fill vacancies: (1) an open "competitive examination" process, and (2) the "merit promotion" process. 505 F.3d at 1381. When an agency uses both types of hiring processes for a particular position, it issues "dual announcements." The open competitive examination generally is used for employees seeking to join the competitive service and often is used for reviewing applicants outside the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under this process, applicants for employment are given a numerical rating and placed on a list of qualified personnel for appointment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1). The applicants with the three highest ratings are submitted to the appointing official, who is ordinarily required to select one of them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318(a) (1978)). Under the VEOA, veterans seeking such employment receive special advantages, including five or ten points being added to their scores and being ranked ahead of candidates with the same score. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The merit promotion process is used when the position is to be filled by an employee of the agency or by an applicant from outside the agency who has "status" in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(1)). Veterans' point preferences under the competitive appointment process do not apply in the merit promotion process, but veterans may not be denied the opportunity to apply. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f)(3)-(4)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Joseph, we looked to <span class="Italic">Abell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003), to provide guidance. <span class="Italic">Joseph</span>, 505 F.3d at 1384-85. In <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, we determined that use of dual vacancy announcements did not violate the VEOA. 343 F.3d at 1384-85. We concluded that because the veteran was given the opportunity to compete in the process, which was all that the VEOA required, the Navy's decision to fill the position through the merit promotion system rather than through the competitive process did not violate the veteran's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We then adopted the same reasoning and result in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span> to determine that dual vacancy announcements did not violate the VEOA. 505 F.3d at 1384-85.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have interpreted a violation of USERRA to require "discriminatory animus," or that the veteran be treated in a harsher manner than non-veterans. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Here, Mr. Jolley did not allege specific facts indicating that dual announcements were utilized in a discriminatory way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove a USERRA violation, an appellant bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was "a substantial or motivating factor" in the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013. Mr. Jolley alleges he would have been selected to fill the 2017 HUD vacancies "if the competition had been fairly administered in accordance with law." Appeal No. 2018-1538 Appendix 25. Mr. Jolley then alleges that the fact that he appealed his 2016 non-selections to the Department of Labor and the Board was a substantial and motivating factor for him not being selected to fill the 2017 vacancies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Mr. Jolley does not provide anything more specific to support these otherwise conclusory allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the record presented, we agree that Mr. Jolley did not meet his burden of making non-frivolous allegations that HUD violated the VEOA or USERRA by not selecting Mr. Jolley for the 2017 vacancies. Accordingly, we agree that the Board does not have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Jolley's VEOA and USERRA claims. We also agree that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear the VEOA appeal because Mr. Jolley did not exhaust his Department of Labor remedy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DHUD</span>, 299 Fed. Appx. 966, 968 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (dual announcement recruitments did not violate USERRA: "[t]he merit promotion list places nonveterans and veterans on equal footing, because it does not add preference points to any application. Thus, it cannot be said that veterans are treated 'more harshly than non-veterans' through the use of dual announcements. <span class="Italic">Fahrenbacher v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 85 MSPR 500, 510 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom Sheehan,</span> 240 F.3d 1009"); <span class="Italic">McPherson v.

It does not, however, guarantee that a preference eligible veteran will actually be selected"); <span class="Italic">Kim v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 343 F.3d 1378, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Lastly, as explained by the administrative judge, an agency is permitted to announce a single vacancy under both merit promotion and competitive procedures simultaneously, and it is permitted to make a selection from either certificate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 684, &#x00B6; 11 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 505 F.3d 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The agency's decision to do so does not violate the veterans' preference rights of the individuals on the certificate from which it did not make its selection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 548 F.3d 1370, 1372-74 (Fed. Cir. 2008)."); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. DHHS</span>, 111 MSPR 1, 3 &#x00B6; 4, 2008 MSPB 245 (2008) (to remedy a VEOA violation the agency could properly cancel the original appointment, reconstruct the certificate of eligibles in accordance with veterans preference law, and then decide not to select anyone).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency advertises a position through both merit promotion and competitive vacancy procedures, the applicant should follow the directions given by the agency and cannot complain of a VEOA violation if the clearly-stated directions are not followed, <span class="Italic">Spaulding v. DHS,</span> DA-3330-11-0253-I-1 (NP 6/21/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the record is clear that the appellant failed to comply with the agency's explicit application instructions and, as such, does not support the appellant's claim that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights. In that regard, we have considered <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 341 (2012), and find it distinguishable from the circumstances in this case. Here, unlike the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, there was no "minor technical mistake" by the appellant in submitting his application. Rather, the agency provided the applicants with explicit instructions on how to apply for both the merit promotion and the competitive vacancy announcements, and it warned the applicants that any single application or one not clearly marked would be considered only under the merit promotion announcement. The agency's application instructions are consistent with the guidance from the Office of Personnel Management's Delegated Examining Operations Handbook: A Guide for Federal Agency Examining Offices (2007) (Handbook), which states that, when using an "all sources" announcement, "the agency must include specific application instructions for the VEOA eligible in the vacancy announcement that are consistent with the agency's policies and procedures for accepting and processing applications." Here, the agency included specific application instructions consistent with policies and procedures for accepting and processing applications and processed the appellant's application in accordance with those instructions when the appellant submitted only one application. Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to hold the agency responsible for the appellant's failure to comply with the posted application instructions.</p>
