<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 525 (Fed. Cir. 1992), involving an IRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the Civil Service Reform Act gives an employee the right to a hearing "from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation," 5 USC 7701(a)(1) (1988), the Board is not required to conduct a hearing where the complaint does not allege a valid charge of whistleblowing within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Manning v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1426, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (approving Board finding that "petitioner has a right to a hearing only in those actions over which the MSPB has jurisdiction")....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The trick is how to allege a valid charge of whistleblowing within the Board' jurisdiction. The AJ is supposed to provide some assistance. "IRA appeals, with multiple interrelated issues frequently supported by numerous documents, are often more complicated than the typical adverse action appeal before the Board." <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 297, 302 &#x00B6; 8 (2000). Under <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 325, 334 (1993), the Board expects the AJ to inform the appellant whether there is a jurisdictional issue and to provide to the appellant "explicit information on what [is] required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue in his IRA appeal." The duty to inform the appellant was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 386 &#x00B6; 16 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue<span class="Italic">. Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Koury v. Department of Defense</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 219 &#x00B6; 11 (1999). In addition, an AJ is required to fully apprise an appellant of his burden of proof on an affirmative defense of reprisal<span class="Italic">. Burge v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Britton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-3443-13-0089-I-1 (NP 3/5/2014) (remanding for proper instruction to the appellant from the AJ concerning particularized IRA requirements when the appellant did not allege whistleblowing reprisal in her appeal but instead raised the issue in a response to a jurisdictional order from the AJ); <span class="Italic">Guzman v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 566, 572-73 &#x00B6; 18, 2010 MSPB 170 (2010) (remanding for additional hearing opportunity as to a whistleblowing affirmative defense when the AJ failed to advise the employee of the burdens and elements of proof concerning the defense); <span class="Italic">Kukoyi v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 404, 409 &#x00B6; 14, 2009 MSPB 103 (2009) (AJ was required to provide explicit information relative to proving that OSC exhaustion requirements were met, including how to show that OSC was placed on notice of an issue through the various types of communications that are possible with OSC); <span class="Italic">Roach v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 4, 8-9 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (in the context of an IRA appeal, "[b]oth the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have repeatedly held that an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish Board jurisdiction.... Upon receiving the appeal following the Board's remand decision, the administrative judge again failed to inform the appellant of all the jurisdictional requirements in an IRA appeal, and in a constructive removal appeal.... [T]he agency's submissions, both in the initial appeal and on remand, were not sufficient to alert the appellant to all of the jurisdictional issues."); <span class="Italic">Burge v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, on the issue of exhaustion, the administrative judge's jurisdictional orders only advised the appellant that he must demonstrate that he has exhausted his administrative remedies before OSC.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cahill v. MSPB</span>, 821 F.3d 1370, 1373-76 (Fed. Cir. 2016), stressed a particularized notice from the AJ on a jurisdictional point--the knowledge of agency managers of the appellant's disclosures--when the agency did not assert that those managers lacked knowledge in response to circumstantial evidence that they would have known of the disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the Board's jurisdiction in an individual right-of-action appeal, it suffices that an appellant exhaust his remedies before the Office of Special Counsel and present "non-frivolous allegations" that (1) he made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) and that (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>, 528 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992). And the court has long treated "a nonfrivolous allegation" of an element required for Board jurisdiction as one that, "if proven, can establish the Board's jurisdiction" insofar as that element is concerned. <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (constructive discharge context); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1344; <span class="Italic">Dumas v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 789 F.2d 892, 894 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("non-frivolous allegation" of jurisdictional element is one that "if proven could make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" on that element).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether Mr. Cahill has nonfrivolously alleged facts sufficient to establish the Board's jurisdiction depends on how his allegations would be understood in context, especially by the responding agency. <span class="Italic">See Middleton v. Dep't of Def</span>., 185 F.3d 1374, 1379-81 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Here, it is notable that in the proceedings before the administrative judge and the Board, the agency, while challenging Mr. Cahill's allegations regarding several elements of the whistleblower claim, did not contend that Mr. Cahill had inadequately alleged that any of the officials charged with the personnel actions knew of Mr. Cahill's disclosures at the March 2012 meeting. The agency's silence on that issue is significant to our assessment of the adequacy of Mr. Cahill's allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The silence suggests that, read in context, Mr. Cahill's allegations adequately communicated that Ms. Gnesda, Mr. Green, Dr. Skarbinski, or all three attended the March 2012 meeting or knew what was said there. In particular, it suggests that there were so few leaders of the branches and teams identified by Mr. Cahill that his allegations about "a group meeting with BCSB management, team leads, project leads, and QSDM management," adequately conveyed a contention that at least Ms. Gnesda, Mr. Green, or Dr. Skarbinski, or all three, either attended or would have learned of what transpired at that meeting. Moreover, the agency would have known, or been able readily to check, both the organizational facts and the roles and knowledge of the three individuals. Indeed, nothing in the record indicates that there is more than one branch chief or assistant chief, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> J.A. 421 (identifying Sam Costa as "<span class="Italic">[t]</span><span class="Italic">he</span> QSDM assistant branch chief") (emphasis added), and the Board at oral argument before us confirmed its belief that each team has only one team lead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's silence on the point is significant in a second way: it deprived Mr. Cahill of notice that his allegations might require greater specificity--which he might well have provided if the need had been identified. The importance of notice of deficiencies before a claim is finally dismissed is reflected in district courts' common practice of providing an opportunity to amend an insufficiently specific complaint after the deficiencies have been identified. The Board itself has permitted an agency to seek a more definite statement where necessary, <span class="Italic">Zimmerman v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 61 M.S.P.R. 75, 77 (1994), and permitted claimants in other contexts to amend their pleadings, <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 38 M.S.P.R. 280, 283 (1988) (citing as guidance Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)); <span class="Italic">see also Balagot v. Dep't of Def</span>., 102 M.S.P.R. 96, 98-99 (2006). But without an objection from the agency as to the specificity of his allegations concerning agency officials' knowledge, Mr. Cahill was not on notice that his allegations should be made more specific, such as by giving the names of the March 2012 meeting participants or the number of individuals who could fit the categories of participants (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, "BCSB management") or by otherwise indicating why Ms. Gnesda, Mr. Green, or Dr. Skarbinski would likely have known of his March 2012 disclosure. Thus, this is not a case in which the absence of readily available details highlights the inadequacy of what is alleged; here, given the lack of notice of a problem and an opportunity to cure, the absence of greater detail provides no support for judging the allegations Mr. Cahill did make to be inadequate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior, supra</span>, noted that the information necessary to the appellant's understanding of what must be established by way of jurisdiction may come at various points of the appeal, but even if the AJ does not provide the proper advice during the prehearing process, the Board may dispense with the requirement of explicit advice to the appellant if the Board determines that the appellant likely knew what was required of her, 96 MSPR at 386-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's initial acknowledgment order in this case did not apprise either party of their burdens of proof in this appeal. This, in and of itself, was not error, as the Board's AJs frequently supplement the information provided in acknowledgment orders with subsequent orders. In fact, the AJ issued a supplemental "Order re Clarification and Jurisdiction" in this case. In that Order, the AJ informed the appellant of the exhaustion requirement in IRA appeals and he directed her to submit copies of all documentation that she sent to OSC. The AJ also informed the appellant that she could only file an IRA appeal concerning one of the personnel actions identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), and he ordered her to identify the personnel actions at issue and to explain how each alleged personnel action met the statutory definition. This order did not inform the appellant of the definition of "protected disclosure" or explain to her how she could show that her alleged disclosures were protected. Similarly, the order did not explain to the appellant what a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction was or that her IRA appeal could be dismissed if she failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his summary of the prehearing conference, the AJ informed the appellant that, to establish an affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing, the appellant "must demonstrate that she was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> whistleblower, i.e., that she had a reasonable belief in her disclosures." This is a patent misstatement of the law, as noted above, and did not properly inform the appellant of her burden of proof or how she could meet it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision contained a discussion of the proper legal standards for establishing whether a disclosure is protected, and the appellant has had an opportunity on review to explain why she believes her disclosures are protected<span class="Italic">. Koury</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 219 &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Orr v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 117 &#x00B6; 7 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 232 F.3d 912 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). In addition, we note that the appellant is an experienced litigant before the Board and other administrative agencies hearing employment disputes from Federal employees. In fact, her prior cases before the Board include at least one prior IRA appeal. Despite her <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, the appellant has shown throughout the litigation of this appeal that she is sophisticated in her ability to conduct legal research and cite to appropriate statutes, regulations, and case law. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Koury</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 219 &#x00B6; 12 (despite the AJ's failure to provide appropriate <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice, a remand was unnecessary where the appellant obtained counsel on review and demonstrated that she was aware of the jurisdictional prerequisites). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the AJ's clear failure to provide the appellant with appropriate notice of her burden of proof did not prejudice her substantive rights and does not require reversal of the initial decision or a remand for further proceedings<span class="Italic">. See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DiGiorgio v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 84 MSPR 6, 11 &#x00B6; 7 (1999), concluded that an order from a AJ concerning the jurisdictional elements of an IRA case was insufficiently specific, although the Board also determined that the appellant was adequately informed of the jurisdictional elements by his own counsel, a practitioner experienced in civil service litigation, who addressed the jurisdiction elements in his submissions to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only guidance provided by the AJ regarding these jurisdictional elements was the following language in the order acknowledging receipt of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals by an employee...with respect to a personnel action taken, proposed, threatened, or not taken because of the individual's whistleblowing activities, as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Therefore, your petition will be dismissed unless you allege facts which if true would show that a personnel action was taken, proposed, threatened, or not taken because of your whistleblowing activities. A "personnel action" is defined at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.4(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that this language does not "fully and clearly advise" the appellant of the evidentiary showing he must make under <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> <span id="Page_3854"></span>and <span class="Italic">White</span> in order to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 71 MSPR 671, 676-77 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also Casciotta v. Department of the Navy,</span> 69 MSPR 589, 592-93 (1996). In both <span class="Italic">Lloyd</span> and <span class="Italic">Casciotta,</span> the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office because of the lack of proper notice....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johns v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 345, 348 &#x00B6; 7 (1999), emphasized that a AJ's jurisdictional show-cause order (or a dispositive agency motion) should clearly state to the appellant (particularly one who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>) that the appellant should submit to the Board "any or all evidence on the [jurisdictional] issue before the record closes." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shivaee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 74 MSPR 383, 386-87 (1997) ("Although the agency's narrative response to the appeal did mention the exhaustion requirement, neither the agency's response nor any order from the administrative judge explicitly warned the appellant that the appeal would be dismissed without a hearing if he did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that, if proven, would establish that he exhausted his OSC remedy."). An AJ's failure to inform the appellant of his jurisdictional burden is "magnified by the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status." <span class="Italic">Boughton v. USDA</span>, 94 MSPR 347, 350 &#x00B6; 4 (2003). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Kuriakose v. VA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1274.Opinion.1-17-2020.pdf">800 Fed. Appx. 889, 895</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("Nor has she shown prejudice from the absence of written confirmation of the burdens of proof or the elements necessary to prove her claim. Dr. Kuriakose laid out the burdens and her proffered evidence in an earlier response to the Board's initial jurisdictional order. Dr. Kuriakose has not identified any additional evidence or arguments that she would have relied on had she been given written confirmation of the burden of proof and elements to be proven.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Deficiencies of an AJ's acknowledgment order may be overcome by an agency motion to dismiss that informs the appellant of the requisite IRA pleading requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yost v. DHHS</span>, 85 MSPR 273, 277 &#x00B6; 3 (2000); <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 69 MSPR 386, 388-89 (1996) (despite deficiencies in the AJ's acknowledgment order, "The appeal need not be remanded on this point, however, because the agency's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction put the appellant on notice that, for purposes of his IRA appeal, he must show that he sought corrective action from OSC and had exhausted his OSC remedy as to the matters raised in his Board appeal"). <span class="Italic">Thurman v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 598, 601 (1998), determined that OSC closure letter was sufficient to place the appellant on notice of a jurisdictional issue. Bypassing its case law concerning notice of jurisdictional requirements, in <span class="Italic">DeGraaff v. VA</span>, 73 MSPR 224, 230 (1997), an IRA appeal challenging an AWOL suspension, the Board declined to remand the case to provide another opportunity to the appellant to establish IRA jurisdiction because "we have determined that regardless of whether the appellant met her burden of proof, the agency has met its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action regardless of any whistleblowing activity by the appellant."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although sanctions may be imposed for failure to respond to prehearing orders, in <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 425, 429-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2000), the Board suggested that an AJ should canvass the record to determine jurisdiction rather than dismiss an IRA case because the appellant fails to respond to a jurisdictional show-cause order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued a very specific order informing the appellants of the evidence and allegations of fact that they must submit to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. The administrative judge also instructed them to file that evidence and their allegations of facts in particular detailed fashion, listing the personnel actions and disclosures relevant to each appellant and identifying the disclosures by the nature of the alleged wrongdoing as set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). He also instructed them to describe when and how they brought each disclosure and personnel action to the OSC's attention and to attach copies of all documents provided to OSC. The appellants failed to follow those explicit instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a practical matter, we note that IRA appeals tend to be more involved than the typical adverse action appeal filed with the Board. IRA appeals often involve several disclosures and numerous personnel actions that occurred over the course of several years. In addition, as in this case, IRA appeals can involve several appellants. Thus, as a means of controlling the proceedings before them, it is well within the wide discretion accorded to administrative judges to issue orders that require IRA appellants to clarify their allegations by providing detailed information concerning the nature of their disclosures and the circumstances surrounding any personnel actions that they allege an agency has taken, failed to take, or threatened to take in retaliation for their whistleblowing activities<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(b) (administrative judges have all the powers necessary to conduct fair and impartial hearings and to avoid delay in all proceedings unless those powers are otherwise limited by law); <span class="Italic">Blake v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 MSPR 394 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (administrative judges have broad discretion to control proceedings before them). In addition, prior to a hearing, administrative judges may order appellants to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe v.</span> Department of <span class="Italic">Veterans</span> Affairs, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995). If appellants fail to comply with a properly issued clarifying order, administrative judges may impose appropriate sanctions as necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43. However, even if appellants fail to respond to these clarifying orders, or their responses to the orders, standing alone, are inadequate to raise non-frivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction over their IRA appeals, an administrative judge must consider allegations appellants may have raised throughout the entire record before deciding to dismiss an IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction without conducting a jurisdictional hearing<span class="Italic">. See Briscoe,</span> 55 F.3d at 1573 (when an appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing); <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). In this case, although the administrative judge found that the appellants failed to offer evidence that they raised particular personnel actions before OSC, it was clear, from the documents that they submitted below, that they informed OSC of personnel actions, allegedly taken in retaliation for making protected disclosures, that they included in their IRA appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The difficulty with the Board's orders concerning jurisdictional issues is that they establish an abbreviated form of summary judgment. An evidentiary response to a motion or show-cause order is usually called for in far less time than discovery can be completed. Summary judgment in federal practice is generally utilized after the parties have had an opportunity to conduct discovery. A motion to dismiss tests allegations in the pleading establishing a tribunal's jurisdiction. The Board's jurisdiction should be established preliminarily by nonfrivolous allegations of fact. Board show-cause and acknowledgment orders should clearly state that nonfrivolous allegations are sufficient to support a jurisdictional hearing. Although an appellant should be able to submit evidence at the pleading stage to bolster (or take the place of) allegations, mandatory production of evidence should be saved for production following discovery. The Federal Circuit has not addressed the summary disposition of IRA cases by the Board in a precedential decision, although <span class="Italic">Dick v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20021646290f3d135611523">290 F.3d 1356</a>, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (partially overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20061759437f3d132211756">437 F.3d 1322</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006)), imputed summary judgment standards, and intimated summary judgment procedures, for jurisdictional evaluation of constructive adverse action appeals. In a brief nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Paje v. OPM</span>, 81 Fed. Appx. 326, 327 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), the court said as to a claim that OPM placed the petitioner at a disadvantage relative to an annuity claim because of whistleblowing disclosures--a claim the Board dismissed for lack of jurisdiction: "[s]ummary disposition 'is appropriate, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.' <span class="Italic">Joshua v. United States</span>, 17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994)." Most recently, <span class="Italic">Hessami v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201109079">979 F.3d 1362</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020), eschewed a summary judgment approach as long as the appellant makes minimal factual allegations supporting IRA jurisdiction.</p>
