<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-70"><span class="space">a.</span> One-Year Maximum for Evaluation; Pre-PIP Performance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 4303 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee whose reduction in grade or removal is proposed under this section is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;30 days' advance written notice of the proposed action which identifies--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;specific instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the proposed action is based; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;the critical elements of the employee's position involved in each instance of unacceptable performance;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The decision to retain, reduce in grade, or remove an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;in the case of a reduction in grade or removal, may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance by the employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;which occurred during the 1-year period ending on the date of the notice under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section in connection with the decision;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is not apparent why the statute permits a Chapter 43 action to be supported by evidence of pre-PIP performance. 5 USC 4302 establishes performance during the PIP as determinative of an action against an employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Under regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, each performance appraisal system shall provide for--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;reassigning, reducing in grade, or removing employees who continue to have unacceptable performance but only after an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Since the employee who fails a PIP is subject to removal, demotion (or reassignment), no more evidence of unsuccessful performance is needed. But, the courts tell us, since under 5 USC 4303(c)(2)(A), the decision to remove or demote an employee for unacceptable performance may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance that occurred during the one-year period ending on the date the employee receives the 30-day advance written notice of the proposed action, the agency may support removal with instances of unacceptable performance that occurred prior to the date of the notice of deficient performance. <span class="Italic">Martin v. FAA</span>, 795 F.2d 995, 998 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("Lastly, it is irrelevant that many of the charges in the notice of proposed removal were based upon unacceptable performance which occurred prior to the date of the notice of deficient performance. The statute clearly provides that a removal decision may be based upon instances of unacceptable performance 'which occurred <span class="Italic">during the 1-year period ending on the date of notice [of the proposed removal</span>] .' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 4303(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). Thus, reliance upon any incidents of unacceptable performance which occurred from October 17, 1983, through October 17, 1984, was entirely proper."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Weirauch v. Dept. of Army</span>, 782 F.2d 1560, 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The statute prohibits action being taken under Chapter 43 against an employee on the basis of incidents which occurred before the one-year period preceding <span class="Italic">the notice</span> of proposed adverse action....&#8197;Thus, one year represents a permissible maximum, but not the minimum, appraisal period for an individual employee."); <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 433, 437 (1991) ("Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2)(A), an agency cannot rely on incidents of unacceptable performance that occurred more than a year before the appellant's removal was proposed."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 696, 698 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Brown I</span>), <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 44 MSPR 635, 640-41 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Brown II</span>), <span class="Italic">post</span>. That a proposal notice in an unacceptable performance action refers to events over one year old as evidence of a background or history of unacceptable performance does not mean that the agency relied upon the events older than one year to support the action against the employee. <span class="Italic">Hays v.

DHHS</span>, 25 MSPR 7, 8 n.* (1984) (AJ properly limited agency proof of instances of unacceptable performance to those occurring within one year of notice of the proposed <span id="Page_2941"></span>removal). It is harmless error for the Board to consider appraisals in a Chapter 43 case that go back beyond the one-year reckoning period as long as there is evidence concerning performance within the proper performance period. <span class="Italic">Rosmond v.

Although 4303(c)(2)(A) states that a decision to demote may be based only on instances of unacceptable performance during the one-year period ending on the date of the notice, the statute does not prohibit an arbitrator from considering prior performance evaluations. <span class="Italic">Orphinuk v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2571).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The matter of what constitutes the window for measurement of unacceptable performance was revisited in <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 44 MSPR 635, 640-41 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Brown II</span>) (on OPM's request for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 696 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Brown I</span>)). There it was determined that an agency is entitled to rely on performance deficiencies occurring at any time during the year preceding the notice of proposed action if it can be shown that the appellant failed to demonstrate acceptable performance or to sustain that performance after receiving a reasonable opportunity to do so. Impliedly, <span class="Italic">Brown II</span> permits consideration of pre-PIP performance. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> reasoned, 44 MSPR at 640-43:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A] removal or demotion under Chapter 43 will be sustained only if the agency shows that before it took the action it notified the employee of the critical elements for which performance was unacceptable and provided the employee a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance of those elements<span class="Italic">. Colgan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 116, 119 (1985); <span class="Italic">Sandland</span>, 23 MSPR at 590.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the employee demonstrates acceptable performance during the improvement period or PIP provided by the agency, OPM does not dispute that the agency is thereby precluded from removing or demoting the employee solely on the basis of the deficiencies which preceded and triggered the PIP.[5] Nor is there any disagreement that, if the employee's performance is unacceptable during the PIP, the agency may generally base an action on this deficiency and need not also show that the employee's performance was unacceptable prior to the PIP, as the Board held in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 24 MSPR at 586-87. Rather, OPM's contention is that the agency may rely on performance failures occurring outside the PIP in addition to those occurring during the PIP so long as the former occurred no more than a year before the agency proposed its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM acknowledges that permitting exclusive reliance on pre-PIP unacceptable performance would render the opportunity to improve meaningless and states that it will so advise agencies in a forthcoming Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Bulletin....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument is based on 5 USC 4303(c)(2)(A), which provides that the decision to remove or reduce an employee in grade for unacceptable performance "may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance...which occurred during the 1-year period ending on the date of the notice (of the proposed action)." <span class="Italic">See Weirauch</span>, 782 F.2d at 1563. Plainly, the statute imposes a limitation and does not require that an action for unacceptable performance be based on an entire year's performance. The legislative history is silent concerning the purpose of the 1-year limitation. The Director's contention is that the limitation is exclusive and that the Board lacks authority to restrict more narrowly the performance period which may be considered in taking a Chapter 43 action. This argument is evidently based on an inference from the language of section 4303(c)(2)(A), which does not expressly state that it precludes other restrictions. But, contrary to OPM's contention, the inference is not required to avoid rendering the statute meaningless or lacking in effect. As the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) points out in its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, the 1-year limit would still affect any case in which the agency proposed its action more than a year after the PIP began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale for restricting the performance considered in a Chapter 43 action to the period occurring after the date of the notice of deficiency and opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance is that consideration of earlier performance is ordinarily unnecessary when the employee fails the PIP. If the PIP provided the employee is adequate to fulfill the statutory purpose of affording a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance, then proof that the employee failed to perform at even a minimally acceptable level during that period usually is a sufficient basis for removal or reduction in grade. Evidence of the performance failures which preceded the PIP would therefore not be required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It does not follow, however, that evidence which is not always required to sustain an action for unacceptable performance must therefore be excluded. Agencies may wish to present a more complete picture of the employee's unacceptable performance by supplementing proof of failure during the PIP with evidence of the employee's pre-PIP performance deficiencies during the preceding year. Both OPM and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief urge that the statute not be read to preclude an agency from also relying on earlier instances of performance failure if the agency wishes to do so in order to make a clear and compelling case for its action. The agencies do not suggest that pre-PIP performance deficiencies could support an action if the employee has performed acceptably after being given an opportunity to do. Rather, we understand them to argue that consideration of the context, as shown by evidence of the employee's pre-PIP performance failures, may shed light on the employee's subsequent performance during the PIP. This evidence would also be relevant where the agency charges the employee with post-PIP instances of unacceptable performance of the critical element at issue<span class="Italic">. Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 646 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the question of whether pre-PIP performance deficiencies may be considered in addition to unacceptable performance during the PIP has been answered in the affirmative by the Board's reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Martin v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 795 F.2d 995 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In that case the Board sustained the employee's removal for unacceptable performance under Chapter 43. On appeal, the court found no merit in Martin's contention that his performance improved during the 90-day PIP and sustained the Board's finding that his performance was unacceptable. The court also rejected Martin's contention that the agency had erroneously relied on performance failures preceding the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is irrelevant that many of the charges in the notice of proposed removal were based upon unacceptable performance which occurred prior to the date of the notice of deficient performance. The statute clearly provides that a removal decision may be based upon instances of unacceptable performance "which occurred during the 1-year period ending on the date of notice (of the proposed removal)." 5 USC 4303(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">795 F.2d at 998 (emphasis in original). Thus <span class="Italic">Martin</span> clearly recognizes and requires us to hold that the agency may rely in part on incidents of unacceptable performance occurring prior to the PIP so long as they occurred within the year preceding the notice of proposed action. The inquiry for the Board in performance cases relates directly to its determination of whether the agency has established a legitimate performance plan for the employee and of how the employee has performed under it. A legally sufficient opportunity to improve performance does not release an employee from the necessity of meeting the terms of his or her performance plan. Accordingly, when an agency has provided an opportunity to improve performance and subsequently takes an action against the employee based in part on evidence of unacceptable performance prior to notice of the opportunity to improve, the Board must hear and consider such evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Brown,</span> if the performance standard is an annual standard measured in numerical terms, e.g., so many errors allowed per year, the AJ must pro-rate the standard for the proportion of time that the PIP period bears to a year, judge the performance under the PIP and, if necessary, consider the performance during the pre-PIP period under this standard and similarly, under <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, consider the performance under this standard during the post-PIP period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In summary, under <span class="Italic">Brown II:</span> an agency may rely in part on incidents of unacceptable performance as long as they occurred within the same critical element leading to placement on the PIP and within the year prior to the proposal; and the appellant who succeeds on his PIP may not be removed solely on the basis of pre-PIP unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. VA</span>, 456 Fed. Appx. 893, 896 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) ("an employee who is placed on a PIP and performs satisfactorily during the PIP may not be penalized for unacceptable performance occurring prior to the PIP, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">James v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1985)."); <span class="Italic">Atamantyk v.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 49 MSPR 90, 94 (1991) ("Moreover, while the agency relied on performance deficiencies which occurred during the year preceding the notice of proposed action, it also showed that the appellant failed to demonstrate acceptable performance or to sustain it after having received a reasonable opportunity to do so. The appellant did not display acceptable performance before, during, or after her PIP."); <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 261, 264-65 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 945 F.2d 1184, 1186 (Fed. Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">post</span>. According to <span class="Italic">Hollins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 305, 307 (1990), "an agency [is] entitled to rely on performance deficiencies occurring anytime during the year preceding the notice of proposed action if it could show that the employee failed to demonstrate or sustain acceptable performance after receiving a reasonable opportunity to do so."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Brown II</span> analysis was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 945 F.2d 1184, 1186 (Fed. Cir. 1991), involving an employee's successive PIPs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be no doubt that <span class="Italic">Brown II</span> is a correct statement of the law concerning the timing of incidents of unacceptable performance upon which the agency may rely. The relevant statute, 5 USC 4303(c) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The decision to retain, reduce in grade, or remove an employee...(2) in the case of a reduction in grade or removal, may be based only on those instances of unacceptable performance by the employee <span id="Page_2942"></span>(A) which occurred during the 1-year period ending on the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown II</span>, the Board specifically quoted our interpretation of this statutory section in <span class="Italic">Martin v. FAA</span>, 795 F.2d 995 (Fed. Cir. 1986), where this court responded to an argument that the agency could not rely on pre-notice period conduct as a basis for a removal action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Lastly, it is irrelevant that many of the charges in the notice of proposed removal were based upon unacceptable performance which occurred prior to the date of the notice of deficient performance. The statute clearly provides that a removal decision may be based upon instances of unacceptable performance "which occurred <span class="Italic">during the 1-year period ending on the date of notice [of the proposed removal]</span><span class="Italic"></span> ." 5 USC 4303(c)(2)(A)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">So too here. The agency was entitled to rely upon the 30 examples of unacceptable performance during PIP I, provided that it proved that Addison did not successfully complete PIP II....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy, post</span>, were the subject of comment in <span class="Italic">Musgrove v. USDA</span>, AT-0432-13-0223-I-1 (NP 5/6/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In these cases, the Board held that an administrative judge may determine that, if an appellant performed the critical element acceptably during the PIP, the administrative judge should then determine if the appellant continued to perform that element acceptably thereafter and, if the administrative judge finds that performance failures occurred after the PIP, the administrative judge must determine whether those failures, in light of the appellant's performance during the year preceding the notice of proposed removal, amounted to unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 656-61; <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 644. We have determined that the appellant did not "facially satisfy[y] " his 2012 performance standards, in light of the agency's evidence showing proof of genuinely unacceptable performance in the context of the appellant's annual performance plan. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 656.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What is lost in the discussion of proof of performance errors prior to the institution of a PIP is an explanation of what the agency gains through evidentiary overkill. If the agency proves that the employee failed the PIP, then the agency wins. No mitigation is available in a performance case. If the employee demonstrates successful performance during the PIP, then the employee wins (unless her performance later declines, a phenomenon discussed in the next section). The statutory one-year limitation on proof may have been intended by the statutory drafters as an outside limit of how long the agency can reach back in time from the point it starts a PIP to the time it proposes an action. But, read on, since the next subsection describes the situation when post-PIP performance is important: the employee whose performance improves during the PIP but who then slips into poor work after having survived the PIP.
