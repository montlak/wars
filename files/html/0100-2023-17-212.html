<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-210"><span class="space">7.</span> Temporary Promotions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Many disputes are resolved by arbitrators, and then by FLRA, involving temporary promotions. Some of the issues, including jurisdictional limitations on issues involving classification of positions were mentioned earlier in this chapter. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-198.html#sec9-198">Classification; Accretion of Duties"</a>;"<a href="0100-2023-17-012.html#sec9-13">Claim for Back Pay, Promotion</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The definition of what does and does not constitute a nongrievable failure to reclassify duties and a grievable failure to provide a contractually-mandated temporary promotion has ebbed and flowed over the years. The most recent ebb occurred in 2022 with <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twentynine Palms, and AFGE Local 2018,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-74.html">73 FLRA 379</a>, 379–82 (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting in part), revealing an interest in simplifying the distinction <span id="page_2073"></span>between a matter involving position classification and a legitimate temporary promotion applying terms negotiated by the parties into their contract. The nub of FLRA's analysis is: where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by an employee, the grievance concerns the nongrievable classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5); where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the employee is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective-bargaining agreement because the employee has performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5):
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is a General Schedule (GS)-9 protocol specialist with the Agency. The dispute arose after the previous protocol officer was unable to fulfill the position's duties. The Agency assigned another employee (the supervisor) to the protocol-officer position and the supervisor allegedly assigned the grievant all of the protocol officer's job duties. In October 2019, the grievant requested a temporary promotion to protocol officer--which is a GS-12 position--because the grievant had allegedly been performing the higher-graded duties of a protocol officer since March 2019. After a series of informal email exchanges, the grievant's supervisors initially stated that they would give the grievant a retroactive temporary promotion to protocol officer. As the informal requests did not produce the desired results, the grievant filed a step-one grievance on February 5, 2020 requesting a retroactive temporary promotion to protocol officer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not temporarily promoting the grievant and determined the grievance satisfied all four parts of the <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> test. In particular, the Arbitrator determined the grievant performed the higher-graded duties of the vacant protocol-officer position at the direction of the supervisor and the job duties performed as protocol officer are different from those performed by the grievant as a protocol specialist.[7] The Arbitrator also found the Agency did not assign the higher-graded duties to meet an urgent mission requirement. Accordingly, the Arbitrator awarded a retroactive temporary promotion for the period the grievant performed the higher-graded job duties of protocol officer and backpay at the higher pay for 120 days. The Arbitrator stated the "retroactive [backpay] must be paid within fourteen...days of the date of this [a]ward."[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;The Arbitrator found the grievant performed the protocol officer's duties from approximately March 2019 until August 2020.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 47 (citing Article 22, Section 3 of the parties' agreement, which states that in the event of an employee failing to receive proper and timely compensation due to Agency error, "[c]ompensation will be paid within fourteen...days of notification of the problem").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute because the grievance involves classification.[14] Specifically, the Agency asserts there is no evidence the grievant performed any duties from a higher grade and the grievance merely seeks additional compensation for the performance of new or additional duties that are a part of the grievant's current position description. Further, the Agency notes the Arbitrator found that it is "unclear whether [the grievant] seeks 'reclassification' as part of [the] remedy." According to the Agency, by finding the grievance only sought a temporary promotion, "the Arbitrator...allowed [the grievant] to modify, supplement, and expand" the grievance.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that employers have a valid interest in temporarily assigning duties for a variety of reasons. However, this "workplace reality," standing alone, does not mean that employees should not be "fairly compensated when they are assigned increased responsibilities above the grade level at which they are ordinarily being paid."[24] Consequently, we find that SBA I does not properly balance the countervailing interests of employees and employers.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, on a more fundamental level, we conclude that the four-part <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> test bears little, if any, relevance to the question it was purportedly designed to address: whether a grievance is barred by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute because it concerns classification. The <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> test arguably considers factors that could be relevant to determining the merits of a temporary-promotion grievance. However, neither <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> nor the decisions subsequently applying the <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> standard explain how its four-part test accurately assesses whether a grievance concerns the classification of any position.[25] Moreover, these decisions have never explained why the Authority should adopt a <span class="Italic">presumption</span> that a grievance alleging entitlement to a temporary promotion actually concerns classification, and is therefore jurisdictionally barred under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), simply because the <span class="Italic">SBA I</span> standard is not satisfied.[26] We find that such a presumption, which has no basis in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), "lacks both a legal and a logical justification."[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by an employee, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[31] However, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the employee is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective-bargaining agreement because the employee has performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[32]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying this standard, we find that the Agency fails to establish the grievance involved classification. As noted above, in concluding the grievance concerns whether the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion, the Arbitrator found the grievant performed higher-graded protocol-officer duties that are different from the duties of a protocol specialist. The Arbitrator also found the Union's grievance alleged the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion pursuant to an article in the parties' agreement specifically governing such matters.[34] Consequently, the Arbitrator's findings demonstrate that the substance of the grievance concerned whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under the parties' agreement.[35] As to the Agency's claim the Arbitrator expanded the grievance by finding that it did not involve classification, the Arbitrator noted the grievance never mentioned classification and only requested for the grievant to be properly compensated for performing the duties of a protocol officer. Therefore, we deny the Agency's &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) exception.[37]</p>

Under <span class="Italic">SBA</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we take the opportunity to clarify our standards for determining whether a grievance involves a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute),[1] or a temporary promotion that falls outside the scope of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 2015, the Union filed a grievance on behalf of an employee (the grievant) who alleged that she had not received appropriate compensation for certain work. The grievance went to arbitration before Arbitrator John L. Woods. Before a hearing was held, the Agency filed, with the Arbitrator, a motion to dismiss the grievance, claiming that it involved an issue excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure--specifically, the classification of a position under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). On October 27, 2016, the Arbitrator issued an arbitrability award denying the Agency's motion to dismiss.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main issue before us is whether the arbitrability award is contrary to law because the grievance involves classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)--and, thus, is not grievable or arbitrable. Applying our clarified standards here, we find that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars the grievance, and, consequently, set aside the arbitrability award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency employs loan servicing assistants (assistants), whose positions are classified at General Schedule (GS) grade 6 or 7, and loan specialists (specialists), whose positions are classified at GS grade 9, 11, or 12. During 2013 and 2014, the Agency organized a group of employees to focus on certain flood-insurance requirements for loans that the Agency services. Employees who participated in this group flood-insurance project--including the grievant--devoted virtually all of their work time to meeting the project's goals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the project ended, the Union filed a grievance alleging that the grievant, who occupies an assistant position, had performed the duties of a specialist during her participation in the project but had not received appropriate compensation. The Agency denied the grievance, which went to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before a hearing was held, the Agency filed a motion to dismiss the grievance as nonarbitrable under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. Both parties filed briefs with the Arbitrator concerning the motion, which the Arbitrator later denied in the arbitrability award. The substantive portion of the arbitrability award states, in full, "The Agency's motion to dismiss is denied. The grievant is entitled to a hearing on the merits in that I have determined that this [is] a higher[ ]graded[ ]duties case and not a classification case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions to the arbitrability award on October 31, 2016, and the Union filed an opposition on November 10, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we note that the Agency's challenges to the arbitrability award are interlocutory because the Arbitrator has not yet resolved the grievance on the merits.[3] However, for the following reasons, we find that the Agency has established a plausible jurisdictional defect that warrants interlocutory review.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div. Keyport, Keyport, Wash</span>., 69 FLRA 292, 293 (2016) (finding exceptions interlocutory where arbitrator's interim award "postponed addressing the grievance's merits").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(5) states that negotiated grievance procedures under the Statute "shall not apply with respect to any grievance concerning...the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee."[4] The Authority has construed "classification" under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code."[5]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that a grievance involved classification where it sought, for example: (1) a noncompetitive promotion based on the accretion of higher-graded duties to an employee's permanent position;[6] (2) the reclassification of an employee's position based upon alleged classification errors;[7] (3) a change to the promotion potential of an employee's permanent position;[8] or (4) compensation for performing allegedly higher-graded duties at a time when those duties were not part of an established, previously classified position description.[9] By contrast, as relevant here, the Authority has long held that the question of an employee's entitlement to a temporary promotion under a collective-bargaining agreement or agency regulation does not concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ga. Air Nat'l Guard, 165th Tactical Airlift Grp., Savannah, Ga</span>., 15 FLRA 442, 442-43 (1984) (rejecting argument that award was contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) based on finding that "entitle[ment] to a promotion does not directly concern the classification of any position").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Authority's existing standards for determining what constitutes a temporary promotion have not always been clear and failed to recognize the realities of, and flexibilities required of, a 21st Century federal workforce. For example, the Authority has found that a grievance concerned a temporary promotion--and, consequently, was grievable and arbitrable--merely because an employee performed some duties that appeared in a higher-graded position description.[11] In our view, such cases fail to recognize the modern workplace reality that managers often assign employees various duties on a temporary basis as part of their permanent positions, and not as temporary promotions, for any number of reasons. For example, these assignments might be for an urgent mission requirement or just to give the employee valuable experience that could be useful when applying for a future promotion or succession planning. The Authority's previous failure to recognize these realities has led to gray areas in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) case law and confusion among parties and arbitrators. Therefore, we find it appropriate to clarify our standards regarding &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Small Bus./Self Employed Bus. Div. Fraud/BSA, Detroit, Mich</span>., 63 FLRA 567, 571 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now hold that a grievance concerns classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) if an employee seeks additional compensation for performing new or additional duties that are part of that employee's work in his or her permanent position. This includes situations where an employee claims to have performed duties that appear in a higher-graded position description. Such grievances essentially seek to have the employee's permanent position reclassified, even if only for a limited time. Thus, we will no longer follow previous Authority decisions--including those <span id="page_2076"></span>that the Union cites[12]--to the extent that they found claims grievable and arbitrable based merely on the existence of higher-graded position descriptions that contained duties that lowergraded employees allegedly performed for a limited period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Opp'n Br. at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, S. Tex. Dist</span>., 60 FLRA 598, 599-600 (2005); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Med.

<p class="noindent-1">We clarify that, in order to present a temporary-promotion claim that does not involve classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), a party must offer evidence that: (1) an agency <span class="Italic">expressly reassigned</span> a majority of the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position to a lowergraded employee, including all of the grade-controlling duties of that position; (2) the reassigned duties were <span class="Italic">different</span> from the duties of the lowergraded employee's permanent position; (3) the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, to give the employee experience as part of an employee development or succession plan, or for similar reasons; and (4) the employee did not receive a temporary promotion for performing the reassigned duties.[13] Therefore, a party's allegation that an employee <span class="Italic">assumed</span> higher-graded duties, without management's express direction to perform those duties, will be insufficient to show that a claim is grievable and arbitrable. Using these clarified standards, a claim regarding the following situation would not involve classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5): After a higher-graded position becomes vacant, an agency manager explicitly directs a lowergraded employee to temporarily perform the duties that the former occupant of the higher-graded position performed, consistent with the higher-graded position description.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Of course, if a collective-bargaining agreement or applicable agency regulation contains additional requirements for receiving a temporary promotion, then a claiming party must offer evidence to satisfy those requirements as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When applying the clarified standards, rather than automatically remanding a dispute in which an arbitrator's factual findings are insufficient to conduct a &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) analysis, we will exercise our discretion to review all of the record evidence and determine whether the dispute concerns classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).[14] In this case, the record shows that the Union sent the Agency an email with supplemental information to support the grievance. This email listed duties from the position descriptions of GS9, GS11, and GS12 specialists that the Union alleged the grievant had performed during her work on the group flood-insurance project.[16] However, neither the grievance nor the email indicated that, as part of the grievant's participation in the project, management directed her to perform the duties of any one of those specialist grades in particular. And, obviously, the Agency could not have temporarily promoted the grievant to three different GS grades. Thus, the Union's claim that the grievant performed an amalgamation of duties from three different position descriptions fails to allege that the Agency expressly assigned the grievant the duties of any specific higher-graded position, and we find that the grievance involved classification. Accordingly, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars the grievance, and we set aside the arbitrability award as contrary to law. We also overrule any previous decisions inconsistent with the reasoning set forth above.[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">SBA</span> clarified the standard for evaluating temporary-promotion claims, certain bedrock requirements from previous caselaw remained the same.[17] In particular, long before <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, temporary-promotion claimants knew that they could not avoid &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)'s classification bar unless they identified a <span class="Italic">specific</span>, higher-graded <span class="Italic">position</span> to which the Agency could temporarily promote them.[18] Indeed, it is inherent in the nature of a grievable, arbitrable temporary-promotion claim that it must seek a promotion to a <span class="Italic">position</span>; the concept of a "promotion" to higher-graded <span class="Italic">duties</span> is nonsensical.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, in an attachment to the grievance, the Union lists the grievants' names, departments, assigned grade levels, and grade levels of the higher-graded <span class="Italic">duties</span> that each grievant allegedly performed. However, nothing in the record states what factual circumstances gave rise to the grievance, what the grievants' permanent positions were, or what <span class="Italic">positions</span> were associated with the higher-graded duties that the grievants allegedly performed. In fact, for all but five of the thirty-one grievants listed in the grievance attachment, the Union asserts that they performed duties at multiple grade levels. Those assertions are inconsistent with seeking a temporary promotion to a specific <span class="Italic">position</span> classified at a single grade level. Further, the Union claims the recovery period for the grievance is "ongoing," which supports a finding that the claim does not involve <span class="Italic">temporary</span> promotions.[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 60 FLRA at 65 (finding that the arbitrator improperly decided a classification matter where, in the arbitrator's view, the grievance was ongoing and "permanent [in] nature, thereby defeating any claim that the performance of [the disputed] duties was for a temporary period of time").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we disagree with the dissent that "it is clear...that the grievance in this case is about...'detail[s] to a higher-graded <span class="Italic">position</span>.'" As previously mentioned, the grievance does not identify <span class="Italic">any</span> higher-graded positions to which the Agency could promote the grievants. The grievants assert that they performed an amalgamation of unspecified, higher-graded duties, sometimes at multiple grade levels. Thus, the grievance suggests on its face that it seeks either permanent promotions based on the accretion of higher-graded duties, or the reclassification of the grievant's permanent positions. Long-established precedent recognizes that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars both of those types of claims.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we find that the Union's claim fails to allege that the Agency expressly assigned the grievants the duties of any specific higher-graded positions, and we find that the grievance involved classification. Accordingly, we conclude that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) bars the grievance, and we set aside the interim award as contrary to law.</p>

In addition, there is no evidence, or arbitral discussion, concerning whether the duties were assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, or to give the grievant experience as part of a development or succession plan.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that, under certain circumstances, a grievance regarding an employee's entitlement to a temporary promotion does not concern classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). In <span class="Italic">U.S. Small Business Administration</span> (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>), the Authority found that prior temporary-promotion decisions had often "failed to recognize the realities of, and flexibilities required of, a 21st Century federal workforce."[6] The Authority observed "the modern workplace reality that managers often assign employees various duties on a temporary basis as part of their permanent positions, and not as temporary promotions, for any number of reasons."[7] Accordingly, the Authority held that in order to present a temporary-promotion claim that does not involve classification, a party must offer evidence that: (1) an agency expressly reassigned a majority of the duties of an already classified, higher-graded position to a lower-graded employee, including all of the grade-controlling duties of that position; (2) the reassigned duties were different from the duties of the lower-graded employee's permanent position; (3) the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement, to give the employee experience as part of employee development or succession plan, or for similar reasons; and (4) the employee did not receive a temporary promotion for performing the reassigned duties.[8]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As determining whether a grievance asserts a temporary-promotion claim under <span class="Italic">SBA</span> is a fact-specific inquiry, the Authority requires a well-developed factual record. Here, the Arbitrator undertook the appropriate factfinding to allow us to determine whether the requisite elements for a temporary-promotion claim were met. The Arbitrator found that the Agency expressly directed the grievants to assume the roles of existing higher-graded positions.[9] While there is overlap between the grievants' lead-firefighter duties and supervisory captain duties, the Arbitrator found that the grievants were assigned "the essential duties" from the higher-graded position.[10] As to part three of the test, the duties were not assigned to meet an urgent mission requirement or to give the employee experience. Finally, it is undisputed that the grievants did not receive temporary promotions for performing the reassigned duties. Therefore, the grievance does not involve classification because it meets the requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">SBA</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">Member Kiko notes that the Agency email directing the reassignment does not expressly instruct the grievants to perform supervisory captain duties. However, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency directed the grievants "to fulfill the essential duties of a higher rated position." In support of that conclusion, the Arbitrator found that the grievants "refuted" the Agency's assertion that it had instructed the grievants to perform only lead firefighter duties during their temporary reassignment. Thus, the Arbitrator's unchallenged factual findings compel her to conclude that the first SBA requirement for asserting a temporary-promotion claim is met here.</p>

In contrast, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, the grievants failed to establish a temporary-promotion claim under <span class="Italic">SBA</span> where the arbitrator "did not find that the assigned duties were different from the duties of the lower-graded employees' permanent position." 71 FLRA 771, 772 (2020) (then-Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 78,</span> 63 FLRA 567, 571 (2009), provided a synopsis of the distinction between a nongrievable (classification) issue involving the proper pay level of a grievant's work and the grievable (nonclassification) claim that the grievant is performing work assigned to a higher-graded (and properly classified) job through a contractually-defined temporary promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an <span id="page_2078"></span>employee" is excluded from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed.

Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Mobile, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 778, 779-80 (1999)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has distinguished between two situations in assessing whether a grievance concerns the classification of a position.&#x2003;Where the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to, and performed by, the grievant, the Authority finds that the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 521. However, where the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position, the Authority has long held that the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the agreed-upon issue concerned "whether the [g]rievants are performing higher[-]graded duties" in accordance with Article 16 of the parties CBA, which concerns details. In this regard, the Arbitrator's factual findings show that after evaluating the parties' positions and evidence, the Arbitrator further emphasized that the issue before him concerned "higher[-]graded duties" and not "a classification" matter. In this respect, the Arbitrator found that the matter involved duties performed by the grievants during a six to eight week period when they processed assigned cases received from the Agency's Edit and Error Branch. More specifically, the Arbitrator found that the matter required him to determine whether the grievants were entitled to be paid for higher-graded duties based on the GS-6 "target PD." The Arbitrator's factual findings further show that the Arbitrator "look[ed] to the target PD" and determined that the grievants performed "higher[-]graded duties" and were entitled to a remedy in accordance with Article 16 and thus directed the Agency to grant the grievants "multiple non-consecutive 120 day [temporary] promotions, each one separated by a 12 month period[,]" as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The above findings show that the Arbitrator did not evaluate the grade level of the duties permanently assigned to and performed by the grievants to determine the appropriate classification of their position.&#x2003;Rather, the Arbitrator addressed whether the grievants performed established duties of a higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, 81st Training Wing, Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.,</span> 60 FLRA 425, 428 (2004). Accordingly, under Authority precedent, the substance of the grievance concerned whether the grievants were entitled to a temporary promotion (not permanent promotions) under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the established duties of a higher-graded position. As such, the grievance does not involve a classification matter within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5)[19] where the substance of the grievance concerns the grade level to which the grievant could receive a noncompetitive-career promotion.[20] This principle applies to requests for noncompetitive promotions beyond the full performance level of the employee's established career ladder.[21] In contrast, where an arbitrator determines a grievant's entitlement to a temporary or other noncompetitive promotion based on performance of previously classified duties, the award does not concern classification.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not resolve a classification issue. If the question presented is "what is the grievant's work worth under the applicable pay system?," the matter is one of classification and nonarbitrable; if the question is whether under a provision of a labor contract the grievant is entitled to promotion to a proper classified position, the matter is arbitrable, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Anniston Army Depot and AFGE Local 1945,</span> 64 FLRA 10, 11 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, a grievance concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction of grade or pay of an employee" is excluded from the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure. The Authority has construed the term "classification" in &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) as involving the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position classification plan established by the Office of Personnel Management under 5 U.S.C. chap. 51. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of Labor,</span> 63 FLRA 216,217-18 (2009). Consequently, when the substance of the grievance concerns whether the grievants are entitled to permanent promotions based on the grade level of the duties they performed, the grievance concerns classification within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 218.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this established precedent, once the Arbitrator construed the grievance as seeking a permanent promotion, the Arbitrator correctly concluded that the grievance concerned classification and was neither grievable nor arbitrable under the Statute As he was without jurisdiction to resolve the grievance, the Arbitrator's award of temporary promotions with backpay is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), and we set it aside.[2] <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We note that, consistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) and the Back Pay Act, an employee may be compensated for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher-graded position on the basis of an agency regulation or a contract provision making temporary promotions mandatory for the performance of such duties <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, 81st Training Wing, Keesler Air Force Base,</span> <span class="Italic">Miss.,</span> 60 FLRA 425, 429-30 (2004).
