<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-10"><span class="space">B.</span> CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT DEFINED</h3>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7114(b)((2) requires management and the union to "discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment." The definition of what comprises or affects employment conditions presents an analytical problem for FLRA, and no comprehensive test is provided. Instead, the law develops on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc,</span> case-by-case, basis. The statutory definition is provided by 5 USC 7103(a)(14):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[C]onditions of employment" means personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions, except that such term does not include policies, practices, and matters--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;relating to political activities prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;relating to the classification of any position; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I &#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&#x2003;to the extent such matters are specifically provided for by Federal statute[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Is there a substantial difference between conditions of employment and working conditions? FLRA, reviewing an arbitrator's award, seemed to think the difference was not important, with a decision accompanied by more than 130 footnotes (a lot, even for FLRA) dispelling the distinction, in <span class="Italic">GSA Eastern Distrib. Ctr. And AFGE Council of GSA Locals C-236</span>, 68 FLRA 70, 75-77 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency asserts that its action was a "change in a working condition, not a change in a condition of employment," and the dissent agrees with the Agency in this regard. According to the dissent, the distinction between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" is a "significant" one. But this contention cannot withstand scrutiny. The terms "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" also appeared in Executive Order 11,491, on which Congress modeled the Statute.[119] And in fulfilling his role under the Executive Order to "decide [ULP] complaints,"[120] the Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Relations (Assistant Secretary) applied those terms in a manner that belies the dissent's understanding of them. The dissent asserts that rules and regulations that "define...employees[']...right[s]...constitute 'conditions of employment,'"[121] whereas the "effect" of such rules and regulations "on an employee...would be a 'working condition.'"[122] And yet, to take just two examples, the Assistant Secretary's decisions characterized a policy change regarding the civilian vehicle-registration program for an entire military installation as "a unilateral change in employee <span class="Italic">working conditions</span>,"[123] and a dispute over the telephone-access privileges of a single employee as a "change" in an "established term and <span class="Italic">condition of employment</span>."[124]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Of course, in drafting the Statute, Congress could have endorsed a distinction between the terms "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" that resembles the distinction advocated in the dissent. But the Congressional Record indicates that Congress chose to do otherwise. In particular, Representative Ford explained that Congress was dissatisfied that the Federal Labor Relations Council had interpreted Executive Order 11,491 so as to "virtually eliminat[e] any obligation to bargain over 'working conditions.'"[125] So Congress largely replaced the term "working conditions" from the Executive Order with the term "conditions of employment" in the Statute to signify an "<span class="Italic">expansion</span> of bargaining beyond the limited term 'working conditions.'"[126] Consequently, the dissent's reliance on a purported distinction between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" to <span class="Italic">narrow</span> the parties' bargaining obligations directly conflicts with congressional intent.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[126]<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the dissent's distinction between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" would seriously undermine the Statute's prohibition on "encourag[ing] or discourag[ing] membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with...conditions of employment."[127] As mentioned above, under the dissent's theory, the effects of applying a rule or regulation to a particular employee are merely changes to "working conditions," but not changes to "conditions of employment." Under that theory, an agency could "encourage or discourage membership in a[&#8197;] labor organization by discrimination in connection with,"[128] for example, "when an employee starts and stops" working without violating &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2). In such a case, the agency would merely be discriminating on the basis of "working conditions," but not "conditions of employment." Considering this troubling implication, in a case in which an agency asserted that it had not violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) because, according to the agency, it had changed working conditions but not conditions of employment, the Authority unanimously rejected the agency's assertion.[130]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the dissent also asserts that its distinction finds support in the precedent of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), the D.C. Circuit's decisions do not bear out that <span id="page_505"></span>assertion. In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>,[131] the D.C. Circuit held only that &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) of the Statute does not require an agency to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes to conditions of employment unless the agency "made a change" in its policies, practices, or procedures affecting unit employees' conditions of employment. But <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> did not recognize a substantive difference between changes in conditions of employment and changes in working conditions, as the dissent contends.[132] In fact, the D.C. Circuit's most relevant decision on the purported distinction between "working conditions" and "conditions of employment" stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the Authority has previously held that there is "no substantive difference between 'conditions of employment' and 'working conditions' as those terms are practically applied." <span class="Italic">We think this conclusion is reasonable</span>, given that both courts and the Authority "have accorded [working conditions] a broad interpretation that encapsulates a wide range of subjects that is <span class="Italic">effectively synonymous</span> with 'conditions of employment.'"[133]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is a basic canon of statutory interpretation that "Congress acts intentionally" when it "inclu[des] or exclu[des]" particular words in a statute.[28] Congress defined the term "<span class="Italic">conditions of employment</span>" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) as those "personnel policies, practices, and matters" which "affect[&#8197;] <span class="Italic">working conditions</span>."[29] Under accepted rules of statutory interpretation, two different terms used in the same context cannot mean the same thing and therefore must mean something different. In the context of our Statute, the distinction between these two terms lies at the very foundation of differentiating between purported changes that are, and are not, subject to a duty to bargain.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">To assert that the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" mean the same thing[30] is to engage in a type of circular reasoning that has been criticized by the United States Supreme Court.[31] It is little different than trying to define a <span class="Italic">rock</span> as a <span class="Italic">rock-like object or a cellular phone as a phone that is cellular</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">It is obvious to us that Congress acted intentionally in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) when it used the one to help define the other.[32] It is therefore imperative that we respect that distinction and define the differences for the labor-management relations community.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The terms are related, but they are not synonymous.[33] On this point, the U.S. Supreme Court explained that while the term "conditions of employment" is susceptible to multiple interpretations, the term "working conditions," as used in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), "more naturally refers...<span class="Italic">only</span> to the 'circumstances' or 'state of affairs' attendant to one's <span class="Italic">performance</span> of a job."[34] In acknowledging the distinction between those terms, the Court cited with approval the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which had earlier held that "working conditions" are "the day-to-day circumstances under which an employee <span class="Italic">performs his or her job</span>."[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Authority has previously held that mere increases or decreases in normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 577, 579-80 (2012) (finding that an increased workload did not constitute a bargainable change), <span class="Italic">pet.

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the memorandum did not change the <span class="Italic">nature of</span> or the <span class="Italic">type of</span> duties the officers performed. In effect, the memorandum conveyed instructions from the division chief to his agents detailing how they were to perform inspections when it came to referring vehicles from the primary to secondary lane for additional scrutiny. Supervisors have the responsibility, and must have the prerogative, to direct, redirect, and even adjust how employees perform their jobs.[38] A supervisor does not have to negotiate with the union every time she adjusts or alters how employees will perform their duties.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Third, the directions contained in the memorandum did not change anything and they did not impact a condition of employment. Both before and after the memorandum, the agents continued to perform vehicular inspections at either the primary or secondary inspection areas using the same techniques.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Statute did not require CBP to bargain in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that CBP violated Article 3A.&#x2003;But Article 3A expressly states that the parties are not required to bargain over any matter that they are "not obligated to negotiate under applicable law." Because we have determined that the Statute does not require CBP to bargain with the Union under these circumstances, CBP also was not obligated to bargain under Article 3A. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's finding of a contractual violation also cannot stand.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_506"></span>The Union argues that <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> does not support the Authority's conclusion that the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" have distinct meanings. However, as the Agency notes, that conclusion is based on the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)--not <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>. Section 7103(a)(14) defines the term "<span class="Italic">conditions of employment</span>" as those "personnel policies, practices, and matters" which "<span class="Italic">affect[</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">] working conditions</span>." Applying a basic canon of statutory interpretation,[20] the Authority in <span class="Italic">DHS</span> found that those two <span class="Italic">different</span> terms--one of which Congress used <span class="Italic">to define</span> the other--cannot mean the same thing.[21] When referring to <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, the Authority found it persuasive that the Court had previously recognized that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are susceptible to <span class="Italic">distinct</span> interpretations.[22] Therefore, contrary to the Union's contention, that case <span class="Italic">does</span> support the conclusion that "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" are <span class="Italic">not</span> synonymous terms.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union next argues that the Authority in DHS erred in its conclusions of law because none of the cases that the Authority cited stand for the proposition that variations to the volume of employees' normal duties do not constitute changes over which an agency must bargain. This is simply untrue. The Authority cited <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, Border and Transportation Security Directorate, U.S. CBP, Border Patrol, Tucson Sector, Tucson, Arizona (CBP)</span>.[24] In that case, the agency was responsible for patrolling the United States border with Mexico and apprehending, and then processing, illegal aliens.[25] After the agency experienced a "sharp increase in illegal[-]alien activity,"[26] it began rerouting detained aliens to the Tucson Station for processing.[27] As a result, employees working at the Tucson Station saw a significant increase in their "processing" duties.[28]</p>

Charting a new tack, FLRA decided that the bargaining obligation requires an "actual change" to a personnel policy, practice, and matter, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, and that the change must "affect working conditions"--the state of affairs attendant to an employee's performance of a job:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we take the opportunity to further clarify the standard for determining whether an agency action constitutes a change to a condition of employment, thereby triggering a duty to bargain. In the instant case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated a contractual duty to bargain because it changed a condition of employment by terminating the health services contract which provided employees with access to health service units at their workplace. The Arbitrator also found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by cancelling the health services contract. As remedies, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to restore the health services contract, to reimburse bargaining-unit employees for medical expenses incurred for obtaining services elsewhere, to restore any leave that the employees used for receiving healthcare that would have been provided by the health service units, and to post notices regarding the outcome of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award finding that it had a duty to bargain is contrary to law because it did not change a condition of employment by cancelling the health services contract. Because access to health service units is not a condition of employment, we grant this exception and vacate the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency had a contractual duty to bargain. However, we deny the Agency's essence exception because the Arbitrator properly used a past practice to interpret an ambiguous term, finding that the Agency was separately required by the parties' agreement to provide the employees with access to the health service units. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the awarded remedies violate management's right to determine its budget. We find that the remedy requiring reimbursement of the employees' medical expenses does not reasonably and proportionally relate to the Agency's violation of the parties' agreement. However, we uphold the remedy requiring the Agency to restore the Union's access to the health service units because the award does not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its budget. Consequently, we vacate the award, in part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency convened a Cost Saving Work Group (Work Group), which included management and Union representatives, to identify potential cost-saving measures. One of its suggestions was terminating a contract with Federal Occupational Health (FOH), a Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) agency that provided employees with access to health services units at their workplace without charge. On February 1, 2018, the Agency informed the Union that it would adopt some of the Work Group's recommendations, but did not mention the health service units. The Agency terminated the health services contract the same day, to be effective April 1, 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union grieved the Agency's action. As relevant here, it contended that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), when it terminated the FOH contract without first notifying the Union and offering it an opportunity to bargain. The parties were unable to resolve the grievance and submitted it to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that Article 5, Section 7 of the parties' agreement requires the Agency to notify the Union and offer it an opportunity to bargain over changes in matters affecting conditions of employment to the extent required by the Statute. The Arbitrator also found that Article 23, Section 4 requires the Agency to "permit employees reasonable opportunity to visit Agency-authorized health service units" without charge to leave and to "actively publicize the medical services. . .available to employees." In the Arbitrator's view, Article 23, Section 4 contractually <span id="page_507"></span>established "working conditions associated with access to the health service units," because the Agency had provided access to health units for at least thirty years and found that this past practice created a condition of employment as defined by the Statute. Therefore, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 5, Section 7 of the parties' agreement because it changed a condition of employment by cancelling the health services contract without notifying the Union of the change and giving it the opportunity to bargain. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator noted that the phrase "Agency-authorized health service units" was ambiguous because it did not plainly obligate the Agency to provide access to the health service units. Consequently, because the Arbitrator found that the Agency had a past practice of providing access to the health service units, the Arbitrator found that Article 23, Section 4 also obligates the Agency to provide employees with access to the health service units. As a result, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 23, Section 4 by cancelling the health services contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to restore the contract to provide health service units, to reimburse bargaining-unit employees for medical expenses incurred for obtaining services elsewhere, to restore any leave that the employees used for receiving healthcare after the health units were eliminated, and to post notices regarding the outcome of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated Article 5, Section 7 of the parties' agreement is contrary to law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law. Specifically, it challenges the Arbitrator's determination that both its past practice of providing access to health service units and Article 23, Section 4 establish that access to health service units is a condition of employment over which it had a duty to bargain under Article 5, Section 7 of the parties' agreement. It contends that it had no duty to bargain over the decision to stop providing access to health service units because bargaining-unit employees' work "does not relate to providing medical services via the health units or related services." Therefore, the change does not affect the "day-to-day circumstances" under which the employees perform their jobs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency must bargain over matters that significantly impact an employee's conditions of employment.[11] However, two questions must be addressed <span class="Italic">before</span> determining whether a change is significant enough to require bargaining.[12] Based on the definition of "conditions of employment" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) of the Statute,[13] the first question is whether there has been an <span class="Italic">actual change</span> to a personnel policy, practice, and matter, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise.[14] Second, the change must "affect working conditions"--the state of affairs attendant to an employee's performance of a job.[15] </p>

<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency changed a policy, practice or matter by eliminating the health service units, that change did not affect working conditions. Here, the Arbitrator did not make any findings which demonstrate that the elimination of the health service units impacted the working conditions of bargaining-unit employees; instead, she found that the past practice established that access to health service units is a condition of employment. To the contrary, the Authority has held that a matter does not become a condition of employment through past practice alone.[17] Rather, an employee's working conditions are affected if an agency-initiated policy change impacts the circumstances or state of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job.[18] </p>

<p class="noindent-1">In that regard, the Union cites several Authority cases to demonstrate that the elimination of health service units affects the working conditions of bargaining-unit employees. The Union cites cases where the Authority found that the price of agency-provided dining services is a condition of employment,[20] held that the elimination of agency-provided water bottles changes a condition of employment,[21] and determined that that the availability of agency-provided daycare facilities is a condition of employment.[22] However, none of the aforementioned cases applied the new standard for determining whether a change affects an employee's working conditions--the circumstances or state of affairs attendant to one's performance of a job.[23] Put simply, the cases cited by the Union do not demonstrate that the change affected the performance of an employee's day-to-day job. Relatedly, in <span class="Italic">DOD, Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA),</span> we held that the elimination of the ability to have personal packages delivered to employees' workplaces did not establish a direct connection to the work situation or employment relationship of the employees.[24] Consequently, we will no longer follow the test set forth in the cases cited by the Union.[25] </p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the attached recommended decision, the Federal Labor Relations Authority's (FLRA) Chief Administrative Law Judge David L. Welch (Judge) found that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) by discontinuing personalized workplace package delivery to employees without first providing the Union notice of, and an opportunity to bargain over, the change. Because the Judge erred in concluding that this dispute affected employees' conditions of employment, we find that he erred in concluding that the Respondent violated its duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Judge's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the attached Judge's decision sets forth the relevant facts in detail, we will only briefly summarize them here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The bargaining&#8209;unit employees (BUEs) in this case are teachers, counselors, and nurses who work for the Department of Defense's Department of Defense Education Activity (DODEA/Respondent) and are stationed in Rota, Spain. The DODEA school is a tenant at the U.S. Navy Base in Rota.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_509"></span>As is the case at many overseas military installations, the Navy operates a post office for the benefit of military members and any civilian employees who are assigned to the Rota base.[1] Around 1992, a practice began whereby, every business day, a DODEA supply clerk would pick up from the base post office the personal mail of school employees and deliver the mail to those employees' individual "distribution box[es]." The practice was recognized by, and incorporated into, the parties' collective-bargaining agreement (CBA or agreement) in 1994.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 406, 3401; Executive Order 12,556, 51 Fed. Reg. 13205 (Apr. 16, 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 8, 2016, the Navy's postmaster notified the school's principal that, pursuant to a modification to Navy Instruction 5112.1 (in January 2016), the DODEA supply clerk--whom the parties sometimes refer to as a mail orderly--could no longer be permitted to pick up and deliver personal mail to employees at the school. In turn, the principal of the school immediately sent an email to the school's employees, which explained that, due to a "change in...Navy policy," the mail delivery practice could no longer be continued. The principal, however, convinced the postmaster to delay the effective date of the change to September 15, 2016. As a result of a series of further discussions between the employees and the principal, and the principal and the postmaster, some employees continued to have their mail picked up and delivered until April 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed an unfair-labor-practice (ULP) charge on January 26, 2017, alleging that, by failing to provide it notice of, and an opportunity to bargain over, the change in the mail delivery policy, DODEA committed a ULP. The General Counsel (GC) issued a complaint on June 14, 2017, arguing that by failing to give notice and an opportunity to bargain before implementing the change, the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5). After a hearing, the Judge issued a recommended decision on May 31, 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In that decision, as relevant here, the Judge found that the change affected conditions of employment. Applying the two-pronged test found in <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Ass'n</span> (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>) and discussed further below,[9] the Judge emphasized that not only was the practice reflected in the parties' CBA, but lunch breaks, planning periods, meetings, and extracurricular activities would be impacted by the change as well. Accordingly, the Judge concluded that, under <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, there was a "direct connection between the delivery of personal mail and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 24-26 (citing <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 237 (1986)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also determined that the change had greater than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. Evaluating both the actual and reasonably foreseeable effects, he noted that after the change some employees were unable to retrieve--or were delayed in retrieving--packages, others had to sacrifice their lunch break or planning period time, and some had to ask coworkers to coach sports practices for them in order to be able to retrieve packages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, the Judge found that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by unilaterally implementing a change with greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effects on conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent filed exceptions to the decision on July 2, 2018, and the GC filed an opposition on July 20, 2018.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Judge erred in finding that the delivery of personal mail constituted a condition of employment</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Respondent argues that the Judge erred in his application of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, resulting in the erroneous conclusion that the ability to have personal packages delivered to employees' workplaces concerns those employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a matter concerns bargaining&#8209;unit employees' conditions of employment, the Authority has previously applied a two-pronged test set forth in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>.[13] Under <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority has asked whether: (1) the matter pertained to bargaining&#8209;unit employees; and (2) the record established a direct connection between the matter and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees.[14] With respect to the second prong of the test--direct connection--the Authority has "inquire[d] into the extent and nature of the effect of the practice" on employees' work situation or employment relationship, including whether there is a "link" or "'nexus' between th[e] matter and the worker's employment."[15] "In 'close cases,' which 'fall[&#8197;] within [a] gray area' where a matter might or might not be a condition of employment under the Authority's precedent, the existence of a 'past practice can be determinative.'"[16] However, a matter that is not a condition of employment does not become one "through practice or agreement" alone.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;22 FLRA at 236-37. However, the Authority has more recently undertaken a reexamination of the relationship between the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) of the Statute<span class="Italic">.

The <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test likewise will merit a plain-wording reformation to clearly differentiate between the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions." However, we need not explore that eventuality in this particular case because--for the reasons explained more fully below--even under the expansive <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test, as the Authority has previously applied it, we find that the Respondent did not have a duty to bargain here. <span class="Italic">See also</span> note 14.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we must determine whether a requirement that the Respondent devote personnel to the retrieval and delivery of employees' personal packages to their workplaces concerns those employees' conditions of employment. Under the first prong of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the proposal pertains to bargaining-unit employees because it concerns their personal packages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second prong of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Judge found that prong satisfied because he determined that: (1) "it is essential for employees to have access to the American mail system"; (2) the change in package delivery "could lead employees to sacrifice lunch breaks and planning periods, as well as after&#8209;school meetings and overseeing extracurricular activities, in order to pick up packages"; and (3) the direct connection to employees' work situation or employment relationship is "readily apparently from the Respondent's longstanding [delivery] practices," including the regulation of those practices through the parties' collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the Judge's first finding, unit employees do benefit from their access to the American mail system. However, even before the change here, employees "would have to go to the post office to <span class="Italic">send</span> packages," which shows that access to the American mail system is not dependent on a personal, employer&#8209;sponsored delivery service to transport mail items to (or from) the employees' workplaces. Rather than access to the American mail system, what is at issue here is personalized workplace package delivery. We acknowledge the Judge's findings that several employees found it inconvenient to retrieve their packages from the post office.[22] But the inconvenience of needing to retrieve a package during work hours is not unique to the employees at issue here or their particular work situation. In fact, it seems reasonable to assume that most employees in any vocation would prefer if their employers were responsible for retrieving all of their packages and delivering them to the workplace so that the employees never had to adjust their daily routines. However, the added convenience of personalized workplace package delivery does not establish a direct connection to the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find this case similar to <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>,[24] where the union proposed that the agency authorize professional employees to cash personal checks through the agency's treasury or its branch offices. The proposal aimed to expand employees' opportunities to interact with the banking system while at their workplace--an aspect of their daily lives that seems no less important than accessing the mail system. <span id="page_510"></span>And at the time that the Authority decided the case in 1985, before ubiquitous electronic&#8209;payment systems, the ability of employees to cash their personal checks was essential for maintaining their finances.[25] But the Authority found that employees' ability to cash checks through the treasury at their workplace did not concern their conditions of employment.[26] Thus, the importance of the activity to the employees' lives outside of work was insufficient to bring personal check cashing at the workplace within the duty to bargain.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id.</span> At 891 (discussing proposal that would require that the agency "do everything it can to see that professional employees are authorized to cash personal checks" through the agency's treasury or branch offices).</p>

However, a similar situation would have confronted the employees in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span> who needed to cash a check during a bank's regular business hours. Occasionally, they may have had to miss a small amount of work time in order to cash their checks. But that minimal loss of work time did not change the result in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>, and we do not think it changes the result here either.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>, the Authority found that check cashing involved "non-work activities while in <span class="Italic">non-duty status</span>." 17 FLRA at 892 (emphasis added). By comparison, the Agency here sometimes permits employees to make trips to the post office while they are in <span class="Italic">duty status</span>. However, like check cashing, retrieving packages remains the type of personal errand that many employees in other work environments perform while in non&#8209;duty status. So, we still find <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span> a useful comparator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To further support his conclusion that personalized package delivery satisfied <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> prong two, the Judge relied on certain Authority decisions that we find distinguishable for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge cited a decision involving a workplace fitness facility that the Authority found concerned employees' conditions of employment.[28] However, the agency in that case had, for an extended period of time, publicly linked employee fitness to <span class="Italic">work productivity</span>.[29] Moreover, the Authority cited Congress's determination to authorize agency heads to establish health-service programs for employees as bolstering the agency's own public statements about the connection between fitness and employees' work situations.[30] In contrast, the present case does not involve a similarly direct connection between personalized workplace package delivery and work productivity, nor has the Union cited a congressional determination to encourage agencies to provide personalized package delivery.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Judge compared the current dispute to cases concerning workplace daycare facilities. But the Authority found that the "existence and availability of such facilities can be <span class="Italic">determinative</span> of whether an employee will be able to accept a job with an employer and of whether an employee will be able to continue employment with an employer."[32] Here, none of the Judge's findings establishes that the end of personalized workplace package delivery would lead employees to end their employment with the Respondent. Nor can the importance of package delivery reasonably be compared to the wellbeing of employees' children while the employees are at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 2 FLRA 603, 606 (1980) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, AFL&#8209;CIO, Local 32</span>, 6 FLRA 423 (1981) (relying completely on the analysis in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> to find that daycare facilities at the workplace concerned conditions of employment), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. OPM v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (unpublished table decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also relied on an Authority decision holding that the ability of employees to make and receive personal calls at work concerned a condition of employment.[33] However, the Authority's decisions on such telephone calls have been limited to employees' use of phones for infrequent or emergency situations, or to communicate with a union.[34] For example, in a decision applying <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority noted that employees may need to: (1) let their families know that they must work overtime; (2) schedule medical care; or (3) arrange transportation or car repairs.[35] As for these examples, working overtime is a direct result of the employment relationship, medical care is necessary for employees to remain well enough to be able to work, and transportation to and from the workplace is similarly necessary to allow employees to perform duties there. Regarding the use of phones for communication with a union, the substance of such communications would primarily involve workplace concerns, and the Statute protects the ability to engage in such communications.[36] Thus, the Authority's precedent on personal calls using agency phones found a direct connection between making such calls and employees' work situations or employment relationships for purposes of applying the second prong in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge's prong&#8209;two analysis additionally relied on the Agency's longstanding practice of providing personalized workplace package delivery, and the regulation of that practice in the parties' collective&#8209;bargaining agreement, we would rely on those considerations only if this were a "close case[&#8197;]" in a "gray area."[38] But because we do not find that personalized workplace package delivery is closely analogous to previous matters that the Authority has found to concern a condition of employment, that matter did not become a condition of employment "through practice or agreement."[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that, even under the expansive <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> precedent, the Judge erred in concluding that this dispute affected employees' conditions of employment. Consequently, we also find that he erred in concluding that the Agency violated its duty to bargain by discontinuing personalized workplace package delivery without first providing the Union notice and an opportunity to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Judge erred and the Respondent did not have a duty to bargain, there is no basis for finding a violation of the Statute. Accordingly, we set aside the Judge's recommended decision and dismiss the complaint.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent">Some doctrinal clarification of the nature of employment conditions arrived in a case involving an annual picnic. <span class="Italic">Army Adjutant Gen. Publication Ctr. And AFGE Local 2761</span>, 24 FLRA 695, 697-99 (1986) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>). After the agency and union began to disagree on the format of the picnic, held on working time and on the agency's premises, the agency canceled the picnic without prior notice to the union. FLRA determined, over the dissent of Member Frazier:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude...that the annual picnic does not meet the definition of conditions of employment...[C]ancellation of the picnic did not give rise to an obligation to bargain on its part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two basic considerations involved in deciding whether a matter involves a condition of employment: (1) whether the matter proposed to be bargained pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) the nature and extent of the effect of the matter proposed to be bargained on working conditions of those employees. <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association and Antilles Consolidated School System</span>, 22 FLRA No. 23 (1986). As to the second consideration, there must be a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> analysis to the matters at issue in this case, it is clear that the first consideration is satisfied. The annual picnic involved all employees of the Respondent including bargaining unit employees. Therefore, its cancellation pertains to bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, with respect to the second consideration, we find that the annual picnic principally involved recreational activities and hence had no direct connection to the work situation or employment relationship. We cannot agree with the Judge that because the picnic was held during duty hours and awards were given out, a direct connection <span id="page_511"></span>with the employment relationship was established. Accordingly, the picnic was not a condition of employment, and the cancellation of an annual celebration involving essentially recreational activities does not constitute a change in conditions of employment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While such matters do not give rise to a statutory obligation to bargain, it is our view that they are matters which the parties should be able to resolve between themselves without resorting to the unfair labor practice process. We urge representatives of agency management and unions to resolve this type of dispute bilaterally without the need to invoke statutory third-party processes.</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties were not able to adjust their differences on the picnic, so matters advanced to court, and FLRA's decision was reversed, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1449 (D.C. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he dispute that led to cancellation of the picnic arose precisely because the Center insisted that employees who did not attend the picnic must work their regular shifts, clearly indicating that the Center viewed the picnic as a work-related activity. The picnic was to occur on employer premises, involved an adjustment in the hours that the employees were to spend working at their jobs, was paid for by the employer, and was used by management as an opportunity to present employee awards and otherwise foster a productive work relationship between employees and management. The Center itself thus created an explicit nexus between the picnic and employment at the Center. Under FLRA precedent and the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test, a practice that has such a direct effect on the work relationship is clearly a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, <span class="Italic">Army Adjutant Gen. Publications Ctr. And AFGE Local 2761</span>, 35 FLRA 631, 634-36 (1990), FLRA accepted the court's decision and ordered a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy through reinstatement, pending bargaining, of the past practice allowing employees to attend the picnic during working time.</p>
<p class="noindent">After <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761</span>, FLRA engaged in a more searching analysis of what constitutes a working condition, <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n and Antilles Consol. Sch. Sys.</span>, 46 FLRA 625, 629 (1992):</p>

<p class="noindent">Chairman Cabaniss attempted to provide doctrinal clarification in the distinction between "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" in a concurring opinion in<span class="Italic"> Dept. of Air Force, Eglin AFB and AFGE Local 1897</span>, 58 FLRA 626 (2003), although the distinction that the Chairman sought to draw seemed too fine to serve as a determinant of FLRA law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I write separately to discuss an issue in our precedent and implementing statute that often causes confusion on the part of all involved.&#x2003;Too often, employer changes to employee "working conditions" give rise to claims that the "conditions of employment" underlying those working conditions have been changed without first having engaged in any necessary bargaining over the matter. Suspending an employee without pay for three days, based upon matters set out in an agency regulation, clearly changes the employee's working conditions: having a duty to bargain because of that change to working conditions, however, would not be created unless the agency regulations underlying the suspension action were changed--and those changed parts underlie the basis for the suspension action (e.g., where the regulation was changed regarding procedures for requesting leave and the employee was being suspended for not following those new procedures).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(14) of our Statute notes that "conditions of employment" comprise "personnel policies, practices, and matters,...affecting working conditions[.]" The two are interrelated, but not the same thing. Conditions of employment clearly affect employee working conditions, for example, by determining how much pay an employee gets, how an employee requests sick leave, and whether a crew chief will have to work only on airplanes assigned to them. As there was no change here to the underlying personnel policy, practice, or matter affecting what work assignments crew chiefs had to do, there was no change to bargain over, even though (as here) the crew chiefs' work assignments (i.e., their "working conditions") had been changed<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 9 FLRA 774 (1982). Conditions of employment affect (change) working conditions, but changing an employee's working conditions doesn't mean conditions of employment have been changed. Parties coming before us would benefit tremendously from better understanding this subtle distinction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a decision involving exceptions to an arbitrator's award, it was determined that the design and operation of a physical fitness center concerned working conditions, because the agency formally encouraged the physical fitness of employees and, under some conditions, granted administrative leave for fitness conditioning. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Aviation Sys.

<p class="noindent-1">[I]n determining whether a change concerns a condition of employment of unit employees, a distinction should be made between the subject matter of the changes and the effects of the changes. In particular...the effects of changes are relevant to determine whether, for example, the effects are sufficient (more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>) to give rise to a bargaining obligation. A determination as to whether a change concerns a condition of employment, however, is based on the subject matter of the change itself and whether (1) that subject matter pertains to bargaining unit employees, and (2) the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the subject matter and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Fire fighters, AFL-CIO, CLC, Local F-116,</span> 7 FLRA 123, 125 (1981), for the proposition that an activity concerns a condition of employment when it directly relates to unit employees' work situation or employment relationship. The Agency then contends that Proposal 1 does not directly relate to unit employees' employment relationship, and, therefore, the Agency asserts that the proposal does not concern a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's analysis is incomplete. An activity may concern a condition of employment not only when it directly relates to the employment relationship, but also when it directly relates to the <span class="Italic">work situation</span> of unit employees. Proposal 1 concerns the prices and provision of food services, and because such matters directly relate to the work situation of unit employees, the Authority has repeatedly held that proposals "pertaining to the availability and provision of food services for bargaining unit employees <span class="Italic">are within the mandatory scope of bargaining</span>." <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345-46 (emphasis added)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument that Proposal 3 is not within the duty to bargain because the Agency does not have a past practice of allowing civilian employees the right to eat at its cafeterias is unavailing. The Authority examines the existence of past practices in "close cases" when it is unclear whether a matter concerns a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12,</span> 60 FLRA 533, 534 (2004) (Member Armendariz concurring) (citation omitted). As stated above, if a matter involves the prices or provision of food services at the bargaining unit members' place of employment, then an agency generally must bargain over that matter. <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345-46. This proposal is not exceptional in any way that would justify a deviation from that general proposition. Proposal 3 concerns the prices and provision of food services; the Agency, therefore, is required to bargain over the proposal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The proposal, accordingly, does not involve a "close case[&#8197;]" that would require us to examine the Agency's past practices.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Region X and AFGE, Nat'l Council of SSA Field Office Locals, Council 20</span>, 37 FLRA 880, 888-89 (1990), considered whether "employment conditions" included subscriptions for copies of the <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span> in district office break rooms. Deciding that the newspaper's content--including articles about court decisions and pay practice changes affecting federal employees--made the distribution of the publication an employment condition that could not be altered without negotiations, FLRA commented:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span> is distinguishable from other publications because its contents are devoted almost exclusively to matters directly relevant to Federal employment and to the employees' status as Federal employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the Respondent's assertion that the matter at issue does not pertain to conditions of employment because it is not required for employees to accomplish their work more efficiently or effectively or does not constitute a means or method of performing work. The Authority does not require such a showing to find that a matter pertains to conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">for</span> <span class="Italic">example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington D.C. and US Department of Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Boston, Massachusetts</span>, 37 FLRA 25, 34 (1990) (the availability of potable water was found to directly affect the working conditions of unit employees); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2761</span> (agency's annual picnic and employees' access to post exchange privileges found to be conditions of employment).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's assertion that this case is similar to cases where...the Authority held "that employee access to agency controlled recreational facilities when not on duty, or access to travel and <span id="page_512"></span>educational benefits upon retirement, are matters which do not concern conditions of employment."...&#8197;Although the <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span> may contain information on Federal employees' retirement benefits, it is undisputed that the <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span> also provides employees with other information directly related to Federal employment and to their current status as Federal employees....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA determines that some proposals do not affect employment conditions sufficiently to warrant bargaining.
