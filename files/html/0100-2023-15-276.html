<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a GS-13 Senior Special Agent (Criminal Investigator) with the agency's Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Denver, Colorado. In 2006, Denver District Attorney (DA) William Ritter and United States Congressman Robert Beauprez were opponents in the campaign for Colorado governor. On August 23, 2006, the <span class="Italic">Rocky Mountain News</span> published an article in which Mr. Ritter stated that as DA, he "made it a policy to always send illegal immigrants to jail so federal authorities would have the chance to detain them" but that the "feds often chose not to detain them." After reading the article, the appellant contacted John Marshall, who the <span class="Italic">Rocky Mountain News</span> identified as Congressman Beauprez's spokesman, at the Congressman's office and was told that Mr. Marshall was "at the campaign office." When he spoke to Mr. Marshall on the telephone, the appellant told him that Mr. Ritter's statements in the newspaper article were false. At Mr. Marshall's request, the appellant agreed to meet.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant met with Mr. Marshall at a coffee shop in the basement of the appellant's office building, as Mr. Beauprez's campaign office was next door, and explained to Mr. Marshall and Rick Beeson, who was introduced as a researcher, that as the DA, Mr. Ritter had a policy of structuring plea agreements with illegal immigrants who were charged with felonies, which allowed them to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges in order to avoid deportation. The appellant encouraged Messrs. Marshall and Beeson to verify the policy by searching cases in the Denver court records. A few days later, at Mr. Beeson's request, the appellant agreed to participate in a meeting with researchers from a Philadelphia-based firm at the Trailhead Group. The Trailhead Group is a political advocacy group, although the appellant maintained that he did not know the Trailhead Group was a political organization or that the information he was providing would be used for a political purpose. During the teleconference at the Trailhead Group, the appellant again explained Mr. Ritter's plea bargaining policy as the Denver DA and suggested that the researchers pull case files at the Denver courthouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a telephone call during which Mr. Marshall explained that he had searched the court records and made a list of names from cases of interest, Mr. Marshall and the appellant met again in the coffee shop. At Mr. Marshall's request, the appellant agreed to provide the "alien status information" for the names on Mr. Marshall's list (the Marshall List), and Mr. Marshall's assistant later delivered the list to the appellant. The appellant ran the names through the Central Index System (CIS), the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), the Colorado Crime Information Center (CCIC), ICON, and Accurant databases, although he did not run every name through each database. Following his queries, the appellant made handwritten notes on the Marshall List, including information such as the individual's immigration status, the year the individual was granted legal permanent resident status, the individual's country of origin, whether they were granted amnesty or asylum, and if and when they were deported. The appellant provided the list to Mr. Marshall at the Beauprez Campaign headquarters on September 29, 2006, instructing Mr. Marshall to "focus on Walter Noel Ramo."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 2006, using information provided by the appellant on the Marshall List, the Beauprez Campaign ran a political advertisement alleging that Carlos Estrada-Medina was an illegal alien who was arrested on suspicion of distributing heroin and who received lenient treatment from the Denver DA's office, which allowed him to avoid deportation, and that as a result, Mr. Estrada-Medina was later arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a minor in California. On October 12, 2006, the Ritter Campaign contacted the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to report the possible misuse of the NCIC law enforcement database in connection with the Estrada-Medina advertisement, citing two television reporters' inability to independently verify the accuracy of the political advertisement. On October 20, 2006, the Ritter Campaign filed another complaint with the CBI regarding a second televised political advertisement that made similar claims about the plea-bargaining practice in the Denver DA's office under the leadership of Mr. Ritter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CBI Agent in Charge Jan Simkins began her investigation by conducting a criminal history query through the CCIC, but it did not reference the name of Carlos Estrada-Medina, although it did retrieve a record for Walter Noel Ramo. Ms. Simkins also queried the NCIC to determine who else had queried Mr. Ramo, and the database revealed that the appellant queried Mr. Ramo on September 27, 2006. CBI Director Robert Cantwell contacted ICE Denver Special Agent in Charge Jeffrey Copp, who asked the appellant about the Beauprez advertisement, to which the appellant admitted running Mr. Ramo's name in the NCIC database but refused to speak further on the advice of his lawyer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On or about October 31, 2006, the agency placed the appellant on administrative leave pending the completion of the criminal investigation and an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). On October 25, 2007, the appellant was charged with three counts of violating 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1030(a)(2)(B) for intentionally exceeding his authorized access to a computer and obtaining information from an agency of the United States while acting outside his official capacity as an ICE agent. The same day the appellant was again placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. He was indefinitely suspended on January 23, 2008. Following a jury trial, the appellant was acquitted of all charges on April 10, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 17, 2008, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from federal service based on the charges of Unauthorized Queries of Individuals on an Official Government Computer Database (2 specifications), Unauthorized Disclosure (2 specifications), Misuse of Position (2 specifications), and Lack of Candor (6 specifications). Following the appellant's submission of a written reply, Robert Weber, Assistant Director, Operations, ICE Headquarters, sustained each of the charges and specifications and determined that removal was the appropriate penalty. The appellant's removal was effected February 13, 2009, and he filed an appeal with the Board on March 9, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the hearing requested by the appellant, the administrative judge sustained all of the agency's charges, but not all of the specifications, and found that removal was a reasonable penalty. The administrative judge sustained Specifications 1 and 2 of the Unauthorized Queries charge, rejecting the appellant's assertion that his queries were authorized because he sought to ensure that the agency properly handled the cases and that further enforcement action was not necessary. The administrative judge found that the appellant made the queries as the result of his contacts with Mr. Marshall and the Beauprez Campaign and that the queries were unauthorized because they were not within the scope of his law enforcement duties. Moreover, the administrative judge found that the appellant's assertions that he did not know that Mr. Marshall, Mr. Beeson, and the Trailhead Group were working for the Beauprez Campaign and that he conducted these queries because he needed to be sure the agency did everything right were not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also sustained Specifications 1 and 2 of the agency's Unauthorized Disclosure charge. With respect to Specification 1, the administrative judge rejected the appellant's assertion that the information he handwrote on the Marshall List could be disclosed because it was already in the public domain. The administrative judge found that, even assuming each piece of information existed somewhere in the public domain, the government databases synthesized the pieces of information and linked them together for each individual queried, as evidenced by Mr. Marshall's failure to find the information in the public domain. The administrative judge also rejected the appellant's assertion that his disclosures were authorized because Mr. Marshall worked on <span id="Page_2806"></span>Congressman Beauprez's staff, finding that the appellant should have known that Mr. Marshall was primarily functioning as a campaign operative and that Mr. Marshall's interest in Mr. Ritter's practices as the Denver DA was politically motivated. Further, the administrative judge found that an individual's asylum status would not have been disclosable even to a Congressional staffer under 8 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 208.6. With respect to Specification 2, the administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosures to Mr. Marshall of Mr. Estrada-Medina's FBI number and multistate criminal history were unauthorized. The administrative judge found that the information the appellant provided was not available to the public in 2006, that Mr. Marshall sought it specifically because it was not publicly available, and that the appellant had no law enforcement purpose for disclosing the information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained Specification 1 of the agency's Misuse of Position charge, finding that the appellant misused his position by meeting with Mr. Marshall and Mr. Beeson, providing them with information regarding Mr. Ritter's plea-bargaining practices, and by meeting at the Trailhead Group offices to provide specific examples of Mr. Ritter's policy by referencing information he obtained through his position at ICE. The administrative judge found unpersuasive the appellant's assertion that his sole motivation was to expose what he believed to be an unlawful and dangerous policy and found that the appellant's intent in disclosing the information was furthering the interests of the Beauprez Campaign. The administrative judge merged Specification 2 of the Misuse of Position charge with the agency's Unauthorized Disclosure charge as they were both based on the appellant's disclosure of information regarding the individuals on the Marshall List.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the agency withdrew Specifications 1 and 5 of the Lack of Candor charge, the administrative judge sustained Specifications 3 and 6. With respect to Specification 3, the administrative judge found that, because he previously found that the appellant's database queries were unauthorized and that he must have known that Mr. Marshall would use the information he provided to assist the Beauprez Campaign, the appellant demonstrated a lack of candor when he told OPR investigators that he conducted the queries to ensure that the agency "had not dropped the ball" on those cases. With respect to Specification 6, the administrative judge found that the appellant demonstrated a lack of candor when he told OPR investigators that he did not know the Trailhead Group was a political organization. The administrative judge did not sustain Specifications 2 and 4 of the Lack of Candor charge, finding that the agency failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant should have known by September 27, 2006, that Mr. Marshall was a campaign manager or that, in light of the questionable credibility of Anthony Rouco, the appellant's supervisor, the appellant displayed a lack of candor when he told OPR investigators that he asked Mr. Rouco to retrieve the appellant's database query printouts from the shred bin after learning of the CBI investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge rejected the appellant's affirmative defense based on whistleblower retaliation, finding that the appellant failed to make a protected disclosure as the information he disclosed pertained to the plea-bargaining practices of the Denver DA's office rather than a federal entity and, according to the appellant, was "publicly known." The administrative judge further found that the appellant's First Amendment rights were not infringed upon by the agency because the appellant made the statements at issue in his capacity as a Senior Special Agent with the agency, rather than as a private citizen and because the appellant would not have had access to the information he disclosed had he not been a Senior Special Agent with the agency. The administrative judge also rejected the appellant's claim that the agency violated his right to petition Congress under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211, finding that the appellant was in contact with the Beauprez gubernatorial campaign rather than with Congressman Beauprez' Congressional office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge rejected the appellant's claim that the agency usurped the authority of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) in effecting his removal. The administrative judge found that agencies have broad authority to manage the federal workplace and impose discipline that promotes the efficiency of the service. He further found that nothing in the proposed removal suggested that the agency charged the appellant with violating the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7324(a)(1), noting that the Misuse of Position charge most closely resembles a potential Hatch Act violation but that the agency based the charge on the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards of Ethical Conduct), which prohibit federal employees from allowing the use of nonpublic, government information to further any private interest. The administrative judge found that the agency's action promotes the efficiency of the service and that the penalty of removal is reasonable based on the deciding official's and the administrative judge's consideration of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge 1: Unauthorized Queries on an Official Government Computer Database</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Specifications 1 and 2 under Charge 1, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge improperly required the agency to prove only that the queries were conducted for an unofficial purpose and not that they were both unauthorized and conducted for an unofficial purpose. The appellant asserts that the agency failed to establish that his CIS queries were unauthorized because it failed to establish that his access of the CIS database was unauthorized under any CIS policy, agency policy, regulation, or law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant misconstrues the agency's charge. The agency did not charge the appellant with unauthorized access of the CIS and the NCIC/CCIC databases. Rather, the agency charged that the appellant's queries of the names on the Marshall List were unauthorized and conducted for an unofficial purpose. Further, the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to show that he was required to obtain authorization prior to accessing the CIS is similarly without merit. The agency has not suggested that the appellant was required to obtain authorization prior to accessing the CIS and the NCIC/CCIC databases. Moreover, the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to establish that he violated any agency policy, regulation, or law is similarly without merit as the agency did not charge that the appellant violated any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Levick v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 84, 90 (1997) (finding that the agency did not charge and was not required to establish that the appellant violated any statutory provision or agency regulation; rather, the agency described the appellant's misconduct, proved it, and established that the adverse action promoted the efficiency of the service), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 155 F.3d 568 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts in his petition for review that the agency failed to prove that the queries were conducted for an unofficial purpose because he has maintained that he ran the queries to ensure that the agency's prior handling of the cases was appropriate. We discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's assertion is implausible, especially in light of the fact that the appellant not only ran the queries at the request of Mr. Marshall, but then disclosed the results to Mr. Marshall, who had no interest in whether the agency properly handled cases that were several years old. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge 2: Unauthorized Disclosure</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Specification 1, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's disclosure of information on the Marshall List violated the Privacy Act because the agency failed to establish that, even though the appellant accessed various databases, the databases accessed constitute a system of records under the Privacy Act. Once again the appellant misconstrues the agency's charge. The agency did not charge the appellant with violating the Privacy Act by disclosing the handwritten information on the Marshall List.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts in his petition for review that agency policy allowed the release of publicly available information to anyone and that all of the information on the Marshall List was publicly available and thus permissible to release. The "agency policy" that the appellant relies on as evidence that his disclosures were permitted is an outline of the Privacy Act, provided to him by Anthony Rouco, and, as noted above, the agency is not required to demonstrate that the appellant's disclosures violated a statute or regulation, only that they were unauthorized. <span class="Italic">See Levick,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 90. We discern no error in the administrative judge's reliance on the testimony of the deciding official, Robert Weber, regarding the reasons for which the appellant's disclosures were unauthorized, and the appellant has failed to identify a sufficiently sound reason for disregarding Mr. Weber's testimony. <span class="Italic">See Haebe,</span> 288 F.3d at 1301. Moreover, the appellant's assertion that Associate Chief Counsel Dani Page's testimony somehow established that his disclosure of information on the Marshall List was authorized or permitted is without merit based on our review of her testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we concur with the administrative judge's finding that, even assuming that each piece of information was available in the public domain, "the government databases the appellant accessed synthesized these discrete shreds of information and linked them together." Furthermore, two professional journalists without access to a federal database were unable to find the pieces of information that the appellant disclosed, again illustrating that this information was not as "publicly available" as the appellant claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Specification 2, the appellant asserts that the agency <span id="Page_2807"></span>failed to prove from which system of records the appellant disclosed Walter Noel Ramo's FBI number and criminal history. Once again, the appellant misconstrues the agency's charge. The appellant has failed to establish that the agency was required to prove from which system of records or database the appellant disclosed Mr. Ramo's information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge 3: Misuse of Position</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his assertion before the administrative judge that there is no evidence supporting a finding that he was motivated to disclose information for the purpose of furthering the interests of a political campaign, citing testimony indicating that he was not a political partisan. The appellant asserts that in sustaining this charge the administrative judge failed to reference any law, rule, or regulation that was violated or any confidential or restricted information that was released. First, the agency did not allege that the appellant violated any law, rule, or regulation in its misuse of position charge, and the appellant has failed to cite any precedent requiring an administrative judge or the Board to reference a law, rule, or regulation when sustaining the charge of misuse of position. <span class="Italic">See Levick,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 90. Moreover, the appellant has failed to identify any error in the administrative judge's analysis and findings with respect to the agency's Misuse of Position charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge 4: Lack of Candor</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant restates his assertions before the administrative judge that he was forthright when he told OPR investigators that he ran the queries in the law enforcement databases to ensure the agency handled the cases properly and that he did not know that the Trailhead Group was a political organization. As discussed above, we discern no error with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's assertion that he ran the queries to ensure proper handling of the cases by the agency was not credible, in light of the agency's inability to act further on the cases at that time and the appellant's subsequent disclosure to Mr. Marshall of the information resulting from his queries in response to Mr. Marshall's specific request that the appellant obtain and provide the information. Further, as noted by the administrative judge, the agency's characterization of William Winkler's and Rick Beeson's testimony in Specification 6 is consistent with our review of their testimony at the appellant's criminal trial. Accordingly, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the agency proved Specification 6 of its Lack of Candor charge by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to establish that the agency violated his right to petition Congress under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's actions were not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211, which gives federal employees the right to petition and provide information to Congress. The appellant claims that he had a reasonable belief that he was providing information to a member of Congress, even though he actually provided the information directly to Mr. Marshall. He further claims that it is irrelevant that Mr. Marshall was Congressman Beauprez's campaign manager because the appellant had a reasonable expectation that he was providing the information to Congressman Beauprez and because he was not aware that Mr. Marshall was functioning solely as Congressman Beauprez's campaign manager during the relevant time period. The appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant sought to influence the gubernatorial election and that, in so finding, the administrative judge failed to consider testimony that the appellant had no interest in partisan politics and had no interest in who won the gubernatorial election. He maintains that he was not aware that the Trailhead Group was a political committee or that the information he provided would be used as part of a campaign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), the administrative judge found not credible the appellant's assertions that he did not know Mr. Marshall, Mr. Beeson, and the Trailhead Group were working for the Beauprez gubernatorial campaign. As noted previously, the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe,</span> 288 F.3d at 1301. The appellant has failed to provide a sufficiently sound reason for overturning the administrative judge's credibility determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the evidence in the record shows that the August 23, 2006 newspaper article in the <span class="Italic">Rocky Mountain News</span> concerned the gubernatorial campaign. Further, while the article identified Mr. Marshall as Congressman Beauprez's spokesman rather than as his campaign manager, the article put the appellant on notice that the immigration issue and Mr. Ritter's plea-bargaining policy were issues in the campaign, not necessarily important issues for Mr. Beauprez as a Congressman, especially given that Mr. Ritter was responding to Mr. Beauprez's criticism that he failed to aggressively pursue immigrants who broke the law. Additionally, the evidence shows that at least once the appellant met Mr. Marshall at the Beauprez Campaign headquarters, which was clearly identified as such by a sign on the door and which contained campaign literature. Therefore, even if the appellant initially sought to contact Mr. Beauprez's Congressional office, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant must have realized by the time he made the queries in the federal databases and made the disclosures of information that Mr. Marshall's interest in Mr. Ritter's plea-bargaining practices was politically motivated and not a reflection of Mr. Beauprez's concern for or involvement in the issue in his role as a Congressman. Accordingly, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's actions were not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211 because the appellant's communications did not constitute petitioning Congress but, rather, were with the Beauprez gubernatorial campaign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Steck v. Connally,</span> 199 F. Supp. 104 (D.D.C. 1961), the appellant asserts that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211 "contains no limitations, nor qualifiers, on what information a federal employee has the right to provide to Congress," and thus the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant could not provide "privileged" information to Congress. The appellant emphasizes that Congress' oversight of the executive branch is facilitated by allowing agency employees to provide "unsanitized" information to Congress. We agree that the statutory language in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211 does not, on its face, restrict a federal employee's right to petition Congress based on the nature or status of the information sought to be submitted, and, therefore, we vacate that part of the initial decision discussing whether an employee's right under &#x00A7; 7211 extends to privileged or other information. We reserve addressing this important issue for another day in an appropriate case. However, this in no way alters our conclusion that the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellant's actions were not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211 because they did not constitute "petitioning Congress" within the meaning of that provision.[5] The record evidence demonstrates that the appellant was in repeated contact with the Beauprez gubernatorial campaign rather than with Congressman Beauprez' Congressional office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's disposition of his First Amendment claim. Nonetheless, we disagree with his conclusion that the appellant's disclosures were not protected under the First Amendment on the grounds that they were made in his capacity as a Special Agent. Initial Decision at 38, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Garcetti v. Ceballos,</span> 547 U.S. 410 (2006) (statements made by public employees pursuant to their official duties are not protected under the First Amendment). The record reflects that the appellant's disclosures clearly were not made pursuant to his official duties and, therefore, we reject any reliance on <span class="Italic">Garcetti</span>. Rather, we conclude that the correct approach to the appellant's First Amendment claim is to review it under the traditional <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis; we have done so and find that the government's concern in protecting against unauthorized access and disclosure of law enforcement information outweighs the appellant's interest in providing evidence of allegedly objectionable plea bargaining practices to a political campaign. <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education of Township High School District 205</span>, 391 U.S. 563 (1968).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to establish that the charges brought against him by the agency are within the exclusive authority of OSC.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the first three charges against him are "thinly veiled Hatch Act charges which are the exclusive jurisdiction" of OSC, and therefore only OSC may investigate or prosecute cases involving factual allegations of prohibited political activity. First, as the administrative judge recognized, any disciplinary action that an agency might take against an employee does not preempt OSC's specific statutory authority to prosecute Hatch Act violations. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Winfield,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 402, 407 (1983). Second, the appellant misconstrues the "essence" of Charges 1, 2, and 3. The appellant fails to appreciate that the factual basis of Charges 1, 2, and 3 is that the appellant made unauthorized queries of federal databases as a result of a personal relationship he formed with Mr. Marshall, who requested that the appellant perform such queries, and that he disclosed the results of those queries to Mr. Marshall who had no legitimate reason to know the information. In describing the bases for its charges in the notice of proposed removal, the agency stated that it found the appellant's actions in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct, which prohibit federal employees from misusing their position by allowing the improper use of nonpublic information to further any private interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(3). As noted by the administrative judge, the private interest furthered "in this particular case happened to be a candidate in a partisan political campaign" in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct. Accordingly, while the appellant's actions may also be of interest to OSC given the political undercurrent, we discern no error by the administrative judge in finding that the agency had the authority to discipline the appellant on the basis that his actions violated the Standards of Ethical Conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2808"></span>Relying on <span class="Italic">Arauz v. Department of Justice,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 529 (2001), the appellant asserts that his disclosures regarding the Denver DA's practice of plea bargaining with criminal aliens implicated the reputation and good name of the federal government because Mr. Ritter alleged in the August 23, 2006 newspaper article that the federal government, rather than his office, was responsible for releasing illegal aliens. The instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Arauz,</span> and we therefore discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's disclosures were not protected. First, unlike the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Arauz,</span> the Denver DA's office is not a private organization operating under a federal program and there is no evidence that the DA's office was using a federal program to facilitate wrongdoing. Rather, the Denver DA's office is a city entity with independent prosecutorial power and policy making authority. The agency may disagree with the office's exercise of its prosecutorial power, and, indeed, the office's exercise of its prosecutorial power could indirectly implicate the agency's reputation, but only for those who lack understanding regarding the limits of the agency's powers. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the agency could be viewed as an accessory to the decisions or actions of the Denver DA's office based solely on the plea-bargaining policy disclosed by the appellant. Additionally, the appellant has failed to show that a disinterested observer could reasonably conclude that the Denver DA's plea-bargaining policy actually evidenced wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we concur with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's disclosures did not implicate the reputation and good name of the federal government and thus are not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the Board should give no deference to the deciding official's penalty determination because the agency failed to provide the deciding official with several relevant pieces of documentary evidence, including the Privacy Act outline, Mr. Rouco's testimony at the criminal trial, and the OPR findings demonstrating that Mr. Rouco lied during the criminal trial. The appellant's assertions are without merit. First, as the appellant concedes, he provided the Privacy Act outline and Mr. Rouco's criminal trial testimony to the agency with his response to the notice of proposed removal. The appellant has failed to demonstrate that Mr. Weber did not consider these documents. Moreover, OPR's Reports of Investigation concerning the honesty of Mr. Rouco's criminal trial testimony were completed on February 2, 2009, and April 3, 2009, while the notice of proposed removal and the decision notice were issued on October 17, 2008, and February 11, 2009, respectively. Thus, OPR's Reports of Investigation were respectively issued days before and months after the decision notice was issued. Accordingly, we discern no reason to deny deference to the agency's penalty determination based on the agency's failure to provide the deciding official with the OPR Reports of Investigation regarding Mr. Rouco's testimony at the appellant's criminal trial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts in his petition for review that the penalty of removal imposed against him is inconsistent with the agency's treatment of Mr. Rouco, who remains employed as a Supervisor Criminal Investigator and undisciplined, after he was found to have perjured himself in federal district court. Here, there is little similarity between the nature of the appellant's proven misconduct and the nature of Mr. Rouco's alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). While the appellant was charged with making unauthorized queries in federal databases and unauthorized disclosures, misusing his position, and exhibiting a lack of candor in interviews with OPR investigators, the appellant has failed to suggest that Mr. Rouco engaged in similar misconduct, aside from an allegation of lack of candor in potentially committing perjury during the appellant's criminal trial. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to prove his claim of disparate penalties. Further, given the administrative judge's thorough analysis of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and the deciding official's thorough testimony and written statement regarding his consideration of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the penalty of removal is reasonable in the instant case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McLeod began working at the IRS in 1994. He was removed from his position as a Tax Examining Technician, GS-07, on September 6, 2007, because he had accessed taxpayer data without authorization or business purpose through the Integrated Data Retrieval System ("IDRS") on fifteen occasions from 1997 to 2000. Mr. McLeod did not dispute the charges, and the Board found that the taxpayers whose files were accessed had not consented to that access. Mr. McLeod had no prior disciplinary record with the IRS, and his work received an "exceeds, fully successful" evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unauthorized access and inspection of taxpayer records ("UNAX") is treated very seriously by the IRS. Mr. McLeod attended annual training sessions outlining the relevant access policies and the potential penalties if those policies were violated. Additionally, at the beginning of every session the IDRS program admonishes its users that unauthorized access is prohibited. The table of penalties used by the IRS indicates that removal is the appropriate penalty for a first UNAX offense in the absence of consent from the taxpayer whose records were accessed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official, Cheryl Cordero, Director, Philadelphia Compliance Services, testified that she had considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and signed a form listing each factor. Although Ms. Cordero viewed several factors (including his length of service and previously clean disciplinary record) as weighing in Mr. McLeod's favor, she nevertheless concluded that removal was the appropriate penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McLeod appealed the severity of the penalty to the Board, and an Administrative Judge issued an initial decision upholding the removal. The full Board denied Mr. McLeod's petition for review, and the initial decision became final. The Board had jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (2006). We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will set aside a decision of the Board if it was "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2006). The Board should set aside an agency's selected penalty "[o]nly if the Board finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors, or that the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Postal Serv. v. Gregory,</span> 534 U.S. 1, 5 (2001) (citing application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors as "the Board's settled procedures"); <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall,</span> 178 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("the abuse of discretion standard...pertains to review of agency penalty determinations, [and] we will not disturb a choice of penalty within the agency's discretion unless the severity of the agency's action appears totally unwarranted in light of all factors" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McLeod first challenges his removal as inappropriately harsh, and the result of a failure to fully consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. In particular, he argues that Ms. Cordero improperly imposed the penalty of removal as an automatic response to his UNAX violation, based on her testimony that she could not think of any circumstances in which she would not impose the penalty of removal if a UNAX violation occurred without taxpayer consent.[1] This argument is unavailing. There is no requirement that the deciding official be able to imagine circumstances under which mitigation would be appropriate. Nor is it improper for there to be offenses for which such mitigating circumstances would have to be extraordinary, and therefore hard to imagine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;UNAX violations can occur either because the employee browses files for his or her own purposes (e.g., curiosity about a friend), or because the employee is giving favored treatment to friends by helping them access their tax records. Neither is permitted, but in the second case, the taxpayer has authorized the employee to access the file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is more than substantial evidence to support the <span id="Page_2809"></span>Board's determination that Ms. Cordero properly considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors rather than applying a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. Ms. Cordero specifically testified that she had considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors before removing Mr. McLeod. That testimony explains which factors weighed for or against Mr. McLeod, indicating that each factor was properly considered. Ms. Cordero testified that certain factors, such as his lack of a prior disciplinary record, "weighed quite well in his favor." J.A. 38. She further testified that she considered the mitigating factors Mr. McLeod put forth--taxpayer consent and diabetes--and found them to be untrue and irrelevant, respectively. On the other hand, Mr. McLeod told investigators that the reason he had not committed a UNAX violation since 2000 was that there had been no need to do so. Ms. Cordero relied on that statement in concluding that Mr. McLeod's supervisor would have less confidence in Mr. McLeod, and in concluding that "his ability to be rehabilitated was left open for question." J.A. 39. On balance, she determined that removal was the appropriate penalty. Thus, it is clear that the agency did seriously consider the factors, and concluded that removal was the appropriate penalty. The decision to remove someone who is entrusted with access to confidential information based on a misuse of that access does not clearly exceed the limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McLeod next argues that he was treated unfairly because Ms. Cordero only suspended a similarly-situated co-worker who had committed a UNAX violation. The Board views disparate treatment as an affirmative defense, which Mr. McLeod must prove by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wentz v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 176, 187 (2002); <span class="Italic">see also Facer v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 836 F.2d 535, 539 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (indicating an exception to the general rule that one employee has no interest in how another was penalized applicable when the employee was treated "differently in a way not justified by the facts, and intentionally for reasons other than the efficiency of the service"). Under the Board's rule, Mr. McLeod must establish that the comparator employee was in the same work unit, had the same supervisors, and engaged in substantially similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Wentz,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. at 187.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. McLeod directs our attention to an employee who had been contacted by two taxpayers (A and C), requesting that he access their files. A third taxpayer (B) had not consented to access, but as he was the ex-spouse of A and had filed jointly with A, his social security number had been given to the employee by taxpayer A and taxpayer B's records had been accessed as well. The comparator employee's UNAX violation thus did not violate the privacy of A and C, but rather gave A and C preferential treatment--they received enhanced access to IRS records as compared to a taxpayer who did not know an IRS employee. Ms. Cordero specifically found that with respect to taxpayer B, who did not consent to the access, the comparator employee had "not knowingly and willfully violate[d] his right to the privacy and confidentiality of his return information." The employee was suspended without pay for 30 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Comparing the facts in that case to those in Mr. McLeod's, the Administrative Judge found that Mr. McLeod had failed to prove disparate treatment by preponderant evidence. Because the comparator employee had (or believed he had) taxpayer consent to his access and substantial evidence supports the finding that Mr. McLeod did not, the Board appropriately found that the two employees' misconduct was not substantially similar, and thus there was no disparate treatment when Mr. McLeod received a more severe penalty. The primary problem with unauthorized access is that taxpayers cannot feel secure that their records will not be misused by tax officials. When a taxpayer has consented to access, this concern is mitigated, and the problem instead is that the tax official is misusing access to assist friends or family. It was not arbitrary or capricious to use taxpayer consent as a distinguishing fact. The Board's decision is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disciplinary action is appropriate against an employee who uses confidential agency records on his own behalf in a civil court proceeding. <span class="Italic">Clark v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 467, 478 (1989). <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 101 MSPR 587, 588-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 101 MSPB 103 (2006), sustained an arbitration award that upheld discipline, mitigated by the arbitrator from removal to a 90-day suspension, for what the arbitrator determined to be the appellant's improper access to and use of agency records in support of the employee's EEO case involving alleged nonpromotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant worked for the agency in New York until 1995, when he transferred to the Smithfield, North Carolina office to be near his elderly mother. The transfer required that he accept a demotion from his GS-12 supervisory position to the position of Claims Representative (CR), GS-11. Following the transfer, the appellant made several unsuccessful attempts to be promoted to a higher-level position. Believing that the agency's failure to promote him was the result of discrimination based on his race (African-American), he filed a formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint, which eventually went before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the discovery phase prior to the EEOC hearing, the appellant used his access to agency computer systems to print workload reports for employees in the Smithfield office. The workload reports included the names and social security numbers of over a thousand claimants. In addition, the appellant obtained hard copies of his coworkers' leave balance records, which had apparently been left in the copy room. The appellant provided unredacted copies of the documents to his attorney, Charles Day, for use in the EEOC proceedings. According to the appellant, the documents were needed to counter the agency's contention that he was not promoted because of his light workload and low leave balance. Mr. Day first introduced the workload reports as exhibits during the deposition of the appellant's supervisor, Virginia Jarmond, on March 21, 2002. At that time, Ms. Jarmond voiced concern that the workload reports were being used without first obtaining permission of the parties involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the EEOC hearing in January 2003, Mr. Day again offered the workload reports into evidence. The agency attorney, Patrick Powers, objected that the release of the information constituted a violation of the Privacy Act. The EEOC judge, Regina Stephens, sustained the objection and confiscated the documents. Mr. Day then submitted redacted versions of the workload reports, with social security numbers removed, and moved that Judge Stephens reconsider her decision to disallow the documents. Judge Stephens denied the motion, and subsequently issued a decision in favor of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 12, 2003, the agency proposed to remove the appellant for "failure to comply with the rules and regulations regarding the authorized access and disclosure of Social Security systems and records and violation of the Standards of Conduct." Specifically, the agency alleged that, by accessing the workload reports and disclosing the information to his attorney for use in EEOC proceedings, the appellant committed a Category III Violation, defined as unauthorized access for personal gain or with malicious intent. The agency further alleged that the appellant "improperly obtained and disclosed unauthorized payroll information for private gain." The agency effected the appellant's removal on May 2, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, because he accessed and disclosed the documents in question in the course of an EEOC proceeding, the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII shield him from discipline. In other words, he contends that the charged misconduct is itself protected activity. We are not convinced. It may well be that, if an employee innocently acquires incriminating documents in the course of pursuing a discrimination complaint, and does not subsequently misuse them, e.g., by disclosing them to a third party other than his attorney, his actions are protected. <span class="Italic">See Kempcke v. Monsanto Co.</span>, 132 F.3d 442, 446 (8th Cir. 1998) (applying anti-retaliation provision of the ADEA). However, such protection does not apply when the documents in question are improperly obtained, as is the case here. For example, an employee who steals confidential company documents, even documents that may evidence discrimination, has not engaged in protected activity that will support a retaliation claim if he is discharged for theft. <span class="Italic">See O'Day v. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co.</span>, 79 F.3d 756, 763-64 (9th Cir. 1996).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 638 (1994), affirmed removal of a motor carrier safety specialist who, to defend an action that he thought would be taken against him, removed government records containing information about other employees. Although the records were meant only for the appellant's attorney, his offense was not excused by the Board after he was removed for violation of a criminal statute, 18 USC 641. The statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whoever embezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his use or the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys or disposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, or any property made or being made under contract for the United States or any department or agency thereof; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whoever receives, conceals, or retains the same with intent to convert it to his use or gain, knowing it to have been embezzled, stolen, purloined or converted--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; but if the value of such property in the aggregate, combining amounts from all the counts for which the defendant is convicted in a single case, does not exceed the sum of $1,000, he shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The word "value" means face, par, or market value, or cost price, either wholesale or retail, whichever is greater.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's opinion in <span class="Italic">Heath</span> explained the elements of the charge, 64 MSPR at 644-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find it unnecessary to resolve whether 18 USC &#x00A7; 641 encompasses the unauthorized taking or use of intangible property, such as information, because the appellant did not merely memorize or <span id="Page_2810"></span>copy down information from government records. Using a government photocopier, he reproduced government documents onto government paper. In a case presenting this same fact pattern, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the photocopies themselves, being tangible property, are "things of value" within the meaning of section 641. <span class="Italic">United States v. DiGilio,</span> 538 F.2d 972, 977-78 (3d Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 429 U.S. 1038 (1977). We similarly find that, regardless of whether section 641 applies to intangible property, the photocopies the appellant made and retained constitute "things of value" under that statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Nazelrod v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 456, 460 (1991), the administrative judge found that the agency's charge of theft required proof of an intent to permanently deprive the agency of the possession or use of its property. Again citing the fact that the appellant made photocopies of the agency's documents instead of taking the documents themselves, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not permanently deprive the agency of the use or possession of the documents, and therefore did not commit theft.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge accurately described the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span>, but the charge levied in <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span> was not the same as in the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Nazelrod</span>, the agency charged the employee with theft, but did not charge the employee with violating any particular criminal statute. In the instant case, the agency charged the appellant with theft in violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 641. In <span class="Italic">Nazelrod,</span> the Board noted its longstanding precedent that, when an agency chooses to charge an employee with conduct that constitutes a criminal offense, it must prove the elements of the criminal misconduct. 50 MSPR at 459 (citing <span class="Italic">Messersmith v. General Services Administration,</span> 9 MSPR 150, 157 (1981)). In the absence of a particular criminal statute which the employee was accused of violating, the Board necessarily looked to general principles of law derived from the common law to determine the elements of the offense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nazelrod,</span> 50 MSPR at 460. Where an agency has charged an employee with violating a particular criminal statute, however, we look to the words of the statute, its legislative history, and its judicial construction to determine the elements of the offense that must be proved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 641 makes it unlawful to "embezzle[&#8197;], steal[&#8197;], purloin[&#8197;], <span class="Italic">or knowingly convert</span>[&#8197;] to [one's] use or the use of another...any record, voucher, money, or thing of value of the United States or of a department or agency thereof." (Emphasis added). Although larceny at common law required an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the possession or use of his property, conversion under section 641 may be consummated without any intent to keep, and includes misuse or abuse of property, or use in an unauthorized manner or to an unauthorized extent<span class="Italic">. Morissette v. United States,</span> 342 U.S. 246, 271-72 (1952). Conversion under section 641 does, however, require proof of a serious violation of the government's right to control the use of its property. <span class="Italic">See United States v. May,</span> 625 F.2d 186, 192 (8th Cir. 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency charged the appellant with violating section 641, which does not require proof of common law larceny, we note that the agency did accuse the appellant of committing "theft," a word that does not appear in section 641. The question thus arises whether it is the use of the term "theft," or the language of section 641, that determines the elements of the offense that must be proved. We hold that the statute is controlling. Where an agency has alleged a violation of a specific criminal statute, its use of the word "theft" is merely a shorthand way of expressing the essence of the charge. We note in this regard that section 641 is one of several similar provisions contained within chapter 31 of title 18, U.S. Code, which is entitled "Embezzlement and Theft."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a violation of section 641 does not require an intent to permanently deprive the government of the possession or use of its property, it does require proof of criminal intent<span class="Italic">. Morissette,</span> 342 U.S. at 263. The Court stated that "knowing conversion requires more than knowledge that defendant was taking the property into his possession. He must have had knowledge of the facts, though not necessarily the law, that made the taking a conversion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 270-71. The Court also stated that the presence or absence of such intent must be determined on the basis of all the surrounding facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 276.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts and circumstances surrounding the appellant's actions in making and taking photocopies of agency documents support a finding that he had the requisite intent under section 641. In each instance, he removed and copied documents without the knowledge or consent of his supervisors, while no one else was around, and he admitted that he knew he was not supposed to have these documents. Not only were the appellant's actions unauthorized, they constituted a serious violation of the agency's right to control the use of its property. The photocopied documents contained sensitive and personal information, including social security numbers, a supervisor's comments about the work product of other employees, dates of birth, and service computation dates. The appellant's actions interfered with the agency's responsibility to ensure that such records are used only for the official government purposes for which they were created.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has argued that his sole reason for taking these documents was that he believed he needed them to defend himself against the performance-based action he anticipated the agency was going to bring against him, and he stresses that he disclosed the documents to no one but his attorney. While the appellant's motive may be a mitigating factor in assessing the seriousness of the offense, it does not negate the intent necessary to show a criminal offense. <span class="Italic">See Major v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 31 MSPR 283, 286 (1986), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span> <span class="Italic">by Nazelrod v. Department of Justice,</span> 50 MSPR 456, 460 (1991); <span class="Italic">Joy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 24 MSPR 652, 656 &#x0026; n.1 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 785 F. 2d 322 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Nazelrod v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 456, 460 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proved that the appellant knowingly made and retained photocopies of agency documents that he knew he was not supposed to have, seriously interfering with the agency's right to control the use of its property. It thereby proved all the elements necessary to sustain a charge of violating 18 USC &#x00A7; 641.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was also charged with theft in violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 641 in connection with the Motor Carrier Training Manuals he had in his vehicle and the folders of documents he took from his desk on May 18, 1993. Based on the fact that the appellant returned these materials to his supervisor before leaving agency premises, the administrative judge found that the appellant's actions may have constituted an attempted theft, but did not constitute a completed theft. Noting that the Board will only consider the charges actually brought by an agency, the administrative judge did not sustain the theft charge with respect to these items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases cited by the administrative judge do not hold that a theft has not been completed until the property in question has been removed from the owner's premises. They did not address that issue, as the appellants in those cases were charged only with attempted theft, not a completed theft. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 27 MSPR 521 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 92 (Fed.

Courts have held that all that is required to prove theft under 18 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 641 and 659[6] is any appreciable change of the location of the property, with the intent to convert it to one's own use, regardless of whether there is actual removal from the owner's premises or not. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rainwater v.</span> <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 443 F.2d 339, 340 (5th Cir.)

Fusco,</span> 398 F.2d 32, 35 n.2 (7th Cir. 1968) (construing section 659); <span class="Italic">United States v.</span> <span class="Italic">Padilla,</span> 374 F.2d 782, 787-88 (2d Cir. 1967) (construing section 659).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Section 659 makes it unlawful to embezzle, steal, or unlawfully take, carry away, or conceal any vehicle with the intent to convert to one's own use goods moving in interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the appellant took the training manuals and other documents from the office to his vehicle, and that he intended to remove these items from agency premises. There was thus an appreciable change of location of the property, and the fact that the property was not removed from agency premises altogether would not prevent the appellant's actions from constituting a completed theft. We next consider whether the agency established the other elements of a section 641 offense as to these items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the appellant's removal of documents from the agency on May 18, 1993, the undisputed evidence includes the following: (1) Charles Cloyd told the appellant to clean out his desk and that nothing was to be removed from the office without Cloyd's inspection; (2) the appellant made no attempt to separate personal documents from agency documents when he cleaned out his desk; (3) the appellant removed a number of files from his desk and, leaving by a door that did not necessitate his going by Cloyd's office, placed the files in his truck; (4) these files contained internal agency documents, including enforcement guidelines and procedures, Compliance Status worksheets, and Safety Rating Methodology; (5) Cloyd caught the appellant putting the files into his truck and demanded their return; and (6) the appellant returned them, but he had intended to leave the agency's premises with the documents, and he would not have returned then if Cloyd had not confronted him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was one area of dispute about what Cloyd told the appellant on May 18. In addition to telling the appellant that he was to clean out his desk, and that Cloyd wanted to see any documents before they were removed from the building, Cloyd claimed that he told the appellant that any agency manuals were government property and were to remain in the office along with any internal memoranda or correspondence. The appellant denied that Cloyd said this. He also testified that he considered Cloyd's demand to see documents before they were removed as harassment, because he interpreted Cloyd's statement as indicating that Cloyd wanted to go through anything he had in his desk, including personal items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we credit the appellant's version of what Cloyd said, we find that his claimed interpretation of Cloyd's statement strains credulity. The <span id="Page_2811"></span>only reasonable conclusion a person could draw upon being told to clean out one's desk and leave the workplace, coupled with a statement that nothing was to be removed without being inspected, is that the supervisor wanted to ensure that only personal items were removed from the premises. Such a demand, while undoubtedly upsetting to the employee, would be within the employer's prerogative, and would be expected to entail only a momentary glance at any particular item to determine whether it was personal or agency property. A demand to peruse an employee's personal papers would be neither reasonable nor expected, and we find the appellant's claim to have understood Cloyd's statements to include such a demand to be incredible.[11] <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987) (in resolving credibility issues, one factor to be considered is the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;In a recent decision, we found that an agency failed to prove that a supervisor's order to a subordinate to hand over certain documents on the employee's desk was one that must be obeyed, where the documents demanded included items that would have been protected under the attorney-client and attorney work-product privilege. <span class="Italic">Fleckenstein v. Department of the Army,</span> 63 MSPR 470, 475 (1994). In so finding, the Board noted that it would have been unreasonable to have expected the employee to separate out the privileged materials while the supervisor was standing in his office demanding the entire package of documents<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The facts in the instant case do not indicate that the appellant was in any way precluded from separating personal documents from agency documents. Indeed, as we have discussed above, Cloyd's statements are reasonably viewed as a directive to separate personal documents from agency documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We similarly discount the appellant's suggestion that he thought he was permitted to remove agency property because he had done so, with the knowledge and acquiescence of his supervisors, when he had previously resigned from a position with the agency in 1990. While the appellant's previous experience could have colored his expectations in a subsequent employment, Cloyd's demand that nothing was to be taken from the office without his inspection should have been more than sufficient to disabuse the appellant of the notion that he was authorized to take home whatever government documents he happened to have in his possession.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we conclude that the appellant knowingly removed agency documents from the office without authorization, with the intent to remove them from agency premises, and that these actions constituted a serious violation of the agency's right to control the use of its property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances surrounding the appellant's possession of training manuals in his truck on May 18 were significantly different than the circumstances surrounding his removal of the agency documents from his desk that day. The appellant testified without contradiction that the manuals had been in his truck for a couple of weeks at the time Cloyd confronted him in the parking lot on May 18. He further testified that he had never been told that he was not supposed to take manuals out of the office, and that it was his understanding that employees were permitted to take the manuals anytime they were needed. Although Cloyd said he told the appellant on the morning of May 18 that agency manuals were government property and were not to be removed from the office, the agency has not pointed to any evidence that the appellant was advised of this at any previous time. Under these circumstances, we find no evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the appellant knowingly removed the training manuals from the office without authorization. Accordingly, there is no basis for finding a violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 641.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will generally review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). When not all of the charges are sustained, however, the Board will consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 308. In the instant case, we will consider only the sustained charge of theft in violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 641. Four of the five specifications of criminal misconduct under 18 USC &#x00A7; 641 have been sustained. We find the most salient factors to be considered in reviewing the reasonableness of the penalty here are the nature and seriousness of the offense, the appellant's past work and disciplinary record, his potential for rehabilitation, and the effect of the offense upon supervisors, trust and confidence in the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A violation of a criminal statute, particularly one proscribing the knowing conversion of government property, is a very serious offense. Adding to the seriousness of the offense is the manner in which the appellant obtained the documents that he photocopied, with the appellant searching through the papers and files of other employees in their absence. Although we have not found that the appellant violated the Privacy Act in this regard, we have no hesitation in saying that the appellant violated the privacy of other employees by taking and photocopying these items. Particularly disturbing in this regard is the appellant's action in opening the envelope in Kaye Perdue's desk that stated on its face that it was to be opened only by her. These actions would reasonably be expected to destroy the trust and confidence of the appellant's supervisors in him, as the deciding official stated they did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the appellant felt he needed to obtain documentation to assist him in defending a performance-based removal action does not significantly mitigate the seriousness of the offense. Procedures are available, both under the Board's discovery regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.71-.75, and under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 552, to obtain documents necessary to defend against such an action. We acknowledge the appellant's claim that he was unfamiliar with these procedures at the time he took the documents at issue, but we note that the record does not reflect any attempt on his part to find out whether he had proper avenues of discovery. In any event, the appellant's perceived need to obtain documentation for his defense would in no way justify an indiscriminate search through other employees' desks and papers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's past work record, including his length of service, does not militate toward a lesser penalty than removal. Although the appellant's total period of service with the agency is over eleven years, his latest appointment is of less than two years duration. During the latter period, the appellant received a letter of reprimand for negligent performance of duties, failure to follow instructions, excessive delay in carrying out assignments, and absence without leave, and his overall performance was rated as unacceptable for the appraisal period ending October 31, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our review of the appellant's response to the notice of proposed removal and his testimony at the hearing do not reflect any remorse on his part with respect to his actions in surreptitiously searching through the desks and papers of other employees. We find that this reflects a poor potential for rehabilitation. Accordingly, we conclude that the removal penalty is within the bounds of reasonableness for the sustained charge of violating 18 USC &#x00A7; 641.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vestal v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 1 F.4th 1049, 1054-56 (Fed. Cir. 2021), left undisturbed removal of a revenue agent who, in defense to a proposed disciplinary action, provided to her attorney some taxpayer information to assist in the appellant's defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As both Mr. Dubois and the Board found, Ms. Vestal intentionally disclosed taxpayer information to an unauthorized person for her own benefit. Decision, 2020 MSPB LEXIS 135, at *19-20; S. App. 6. The disclosure violated the law. I.R.C. &#x00A7; 6103(a). Ms. Vestal was aware that she had multiple resources at her disposal--including her supervisors and the IRS Office of Disclosure Services--to discuss whether and how certain disclosures could be made, and in fact Ms. Vestal had previously consulted the Office of Disclosure Services. Yet she made this disclosure without first consulting any of these resources or otherwise obtaining permission from the agency. She also made the disclosure without first redacting any of the taxpayer information, without relying on any advice from her legal counsel when she made the disclosure, and without knowledge of any rule or regulation permitting the disclosure without prior authorization from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Vestal "knew privacy protection was important," <span class="Italic">Decision,</span> 2020 MSPB LEXIS 135, at *30-31, and she received annual trainings between 2009 and 2018 to that effect, <span class="Italic">id.</span>; S. App. 6, 32. Specifically, IRS Revenue Agents such as Ms. Vestal "are trained that taxpayer privacy is ‘sacrosanct' and any disclosure of taxpayer information outside of work is an ‘absolute no-no.'" <span class="Italic">Decision,</span> 2020 MSPB LEXIS 135, at *32. Such unauthorized disclosures are particularly serious in this context, because the IRS "is charged with collecting the nation's revenue, most of which is paid voluntarily," and "disclosure of taxpayer information erodes taxpayer confidence when entrusting information to the agency, thereby jeopardizing the voluntary submission of revenue." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *29-30.3 Furthermore, although of lesser importance to the deciding official, Ms. Vestal had been previously suspended. <span class="Italic">Decision</span>, 2020 MSPB LEXIS 135, at *32; S. App. 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Vestal's primary argument on appeal is that "[t]he penalty imposed was that for willful disclosure, rather than negligent disclosure." Ms. Vestal relies on the IRS Internal Revenue Manual ("IRM"), which states that "[a]n unauthorized access or disclosure" can be considered "willful" only if it is made "with full knowledge that it is wrong." IRM &#x00A7; 11.3.1.9. Ms. Vestal contends that her unauthorized disclosure was not willful because she did not have "full knowledge that [her actions were] wrong"; rather, she contends that she incorrectly believed that attorney-client privilege protected the disclosure from being unauthorized. In Ms. Vestal's view, because her unauthorized disclosure was not willful, the deciding official incorrectly assessed three of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, namely: the nature and seriousness of the offense, the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense, and the <span id="Page_2812"></span>consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Vestal's removal was properly predicated on her intention to disclose the information to her attorney and did not depend on whether she knew that the disclosure was wrong. As to the nature and seriousness of the offense and clarity of notice, the Board credited Mr. Dubois's testimony that Revenue Agents are trained that "taxpayer privacy is ‘sacrosanct'" and that "any disclosure of taxpayer information outside of work is an ‘absolute no-no.'" <span class="Italic">Decision,</span> 2020 MSPB LEXIS 135, at *32. And the Board credited Mr. Dubois's testimony that the intentional nature of Ms. Vestal's conduct--i.e., her intentional transmission of a taxpayer's record to her attorney--was an aggravating factor even though "her disclosure of taxpayer information was not intentional in the sense that she did not intend to violate a law or policy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *31-32. None of these findings are unsupported by the law or substantial evidence. Whether Ms. Vestal intended to make the disclosure at all is clearly relevant to the nature and seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, the IRS might have viewed this case quite differently if Ms. Vestal's disclosure were a mistake--for example, had she intended to send the information to an authorized person but mistakenly sent the information to her attorney instead. But here, Ms. Vestal did intend to send the information to her attorney. It was not improper to consider such intentionality as aggravating. This court has even previously concluded that such intentionality can provide a basis for removal. See <span class="Italic">Zingg,</span> 388 F.3d at 844 (affirming the removal of an IRS employee even though the employee mistakenly believed that the disclosure of confidential taxpayer information was excused).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Vestal also appears to argue that, for purposes of the Penalty Guide, "intentional" and "willful" are synonymous. They are not. The use of "intentional" in the guidelines refers to disclosures that were made on purpose even if the employee did not know that the disclosures were wrong. If the IRS wanted to limit the guidelines to recommending removal only for first offenses of willful disclosures--i.e., disclosures that, in Ms. Vestal's view, require knowledge of wrongdoing--the IRS would have used the word "willful" in the guidelines. It did not. Ms. Vestal provides no reason why the IRS would have used the word "intentional" in the Penalty Guide if it really meant "willful."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be one thing if "willful" and "intentional" were generally synonymous in the law. They are not. The Supreme Court has explained that "<span class="Italic">even in the criminal context,</span> reference to a[n]...‘intentional' ‘violation'...has not necessarily implied a defense for legal errors." <span class="Italic">Jerman v. Carlisle,</span> 559 U.S. 573, 582-85 (2010) (citation omitted). And as compared with "intentional," the term "willful" is "more often understood in the civil context to excuse mistakes of law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 584; see also <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 582-83 ("Our law is therefore no stranger to the possibility that an act may be ‘intentional' for purposes of civil liability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge that her conduct violated the law.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the subject of disclosure of information by client to counsel, the D.C. Circuit opined in <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Schiffer</span>, 204 F.3d 259, 265-66 (D.C. Cir. 2000), not involving criminal charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It thus has long been clear that the First Amendment does not provide a federal employee seeking legal advice regarding a dispute with the employing agency with <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> authority to disclose any and all confidential government information to the employee's attorney, but rather that the scope of the First Amendment right is determined by balancing the employee's interests in communication with the government's interests in preventing communication. Relevant to this balancing is whether the attorney is likely to keep this information in confidence, as suggested by willingness to enter into a protective order, or whether such communications to the personal attorney will operate as a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> public disclosure. Where, as here, there was no evidence to suggest that Jacobs' attorney would publicly disclose the information Jacobs sought to communicate, the First Amendment required a balancing of interests beyond the balance between disclosure and non-disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Understandably, the Department would be concerned about giving <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> approval of unlimited disclosures to one of its attorneys who has access to a broad range of potentially sensitive, non-public information and who is challenging its management of litigation. But the reasonableness of the Department's position with respect to Jacobs' free speech claim regarding his attorney must be evaluated in light of <span class="Italic">Martin</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>. In that regard it bears noting that in <span class="Italic">Martin II</span> the court observed, albeit in dictum, that in the whistle-blower context, where a legal question arises as to whether a contemplated public disclosure would be prohibited by law, "[s]urely, [the employee] must be allowed to consult his attorney for an answer to that question absent some strong governmental interest in limiting such communications." <span class="Italic">Martin II,</span> 686 F.2d at 33 n.41.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing cases involving removal or other discipline of employees who provide copies of sensitive documents to their attorneys without agency authorization, <span class="Italic">Bennett v. DHHS</span>, CH-0752-12-0193-I-1 (NP 4/2/2014), upheld removal of a supervisory EEO specialist for improper disclosure of documents to her counsel in the course of a grievance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge appropriately analyzed the charges and the specifications, and her findings are consistent with the record. The appellant stipulated to the following actions underlying charges 1 and 2. After the denial of the stage one grievance challenging her performance appraisal, the appellant printed out approximately 900 pages of email messages from her work account and took them to her attorneys' office without redacting information such as personally identifiable information, personal health information, correspondence concerning ongoing civil rights investigations, and other sensitive information. The agency's Rules of Behavior (ROB) prohibit the disclosure of sensitive information except as authorized and with formal agreements that ensure that third parties will adequately protect the information disclosed. The ROB also requires that employees shall not transport or transfer sensitive information unless such action is explicitly permitted by the owner or manager of such information. The appellant acknowledged that she received training on the ROB and was aware of the policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that her attorneys are not "third parties" as contemplated by the agency's ROB. The administrative judge made explicit and well-supported findings that the appellant's attorneys constituted third parties within the meaning of the ROB, and the appellant's arguments do not provide a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's conclusions. Further, the Board has sustained charges and upheld discipline in analogous situations in which the appellant disclosed sensitive information to an attorney for the purposes of representation in an employment dispute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. Department of Transportation</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 59, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42-43, 67-70 (2007); <span class="Italic">Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 638, 651 (1994), <span class="Italic">Clark v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 467, 471-73, 475-76 (1989).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's citations to case law concerning whether an attorney is considered an alter ego of the client in the context of conspiracy claims are not instructive in this situation. Such cases are less analogous than the existing Board case law supporting upholding discipline for unauthorized disclosures of sensitive information to attorneys. Further, we find unpersuasive the appellant's argument that somehow her actions were justifiable because the agency would not have responded adequately to her request for information to support her grievance. There is no evidence that she attempted to request the information contained in the documents before printing and transporting them, unredacted, to the office of her attorneys. This <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> justification does not affect the agency's ability to prove the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The federal courts have examined this issue in a number of employment discrimination cases and have confirmed that an employer should be entitled to safeguard sensitive information. <span class="Italic">Niswander v. Cincinnati Insurance Co</span>., 529 F.3d 714, 722 (6th Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Kempcke v. Monsato Co</span>., 132 F.3d 442, 445-46 (8th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">O'Day v. McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co</span>., 79 F.3d 756, 762-63 (9th Cir. 1996). In resolving the issue, the courts employ a balancing test between the employer's "legitimate need to maintain an orderly workplace and to protect confidential business and client information" and the employee's "equally compelling need" to be properly safeguarded from retaliatory actions. <span class="Italic">Niswander</span>, 529 F.3d at 722. The ultimate question under the test is whether the employee's disclosure of the information was reasonable under the circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Niswander</span>, the Sixth Circuit found that the relevant factors in making this determination are: (1) how the documents were obtained; (2) to whom the documents were produced; (3) the contents of the documents, both in terms of the need to keep the information confidential and their relevance to the employee's claims; (4) why the documents were produced, including whether production was in direct response to a discovery request; (5) the scope of the employer's privacy policy; and (6) the ability of the employee to preserve the evidence in a manner that does not violate the employer's privacy policy. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 726.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, only the first two <span class="Italic">Niswander</span> factors favor the appellant because it is undisputed that she lawfully obtained the information in the course of her official duties and shared it with her attorney in the furtherance of an employment dispute. The other four factors, however, strongly favor the agency. In particular, with respect to the content of the documents (factor 3), the emails contained highly sensitive information such as medical information protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, including the identity of individuals who are HIV positive, and information protected from disclosure by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-8 regarding open equal employment opportunity cases. This type of information is required by law to be safeguarded with great care. <span class="Italic">See Parikh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 295, &#x00B6; 20 (2008); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 471-73. In addition, the sensitive information disclosed had little relevance to the merits of the appellant's grievance. Although the documents were produced to support the appellant's grievance (factor <span id="Page_2813"></span>4), they were not produced in direct response to a discovery request. The agency's privacy policy (factor 5) clearly limited the appellant's disclosure of the information, and the agency proved that the appellant was aware of the policy yet still violated it. Finally, the appellant could have preserved any relevant evidence in the documents (factor 6) and still adhered to the agency's privacy policy by taking reasonable measures to redact sensitive and irrelevant information, or she alternatively could have followed the agency's policy for disclosing information by receiving authorization to disclose it with an appropriate protective order to her attorney. We find that the appellant's disclosure of the emails to her attorney was not reasonable under the <span class="Italic">Niswander</span> balancing test. <span class="Italic">See</span> 529 F.3d at 726; <span class="Italic">see Clark</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 471-73. Thus, we agree that the administrative judge properly sustained the first two charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in not sustaining the third charge, unauthorized use of government equipment, because the appellant printed over 900 pages of emails on an agency printer. As is detailed in the initial decision and undisputed by the parties, the appellant used her own paper to print the emails on the agency printer and did so after normal business hours for the purpose of defending herself in an employment matter. Further, the agency's policy allows for limited personal use of its printers so long as such use does not result in other than minimal expense. We find unpersuasive the agency's argument that the appellant's use resulted in more than minimal expense, and we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the documents were not for what is commonly envisioned as personal use.[5] Thus, we affirm the administrative judge's holding that the agency failed to prove the third charge by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The agency's policy does not state whether use of government property for the purposes of pursuing a grievance or other employment dispute is considered personal use or official or government business. In the absence of specific language concerning this matter, we find no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's use did not fall within the common definition of personal use as contemplated in the agency's policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We affirm the administrative judge's findings that the appellant failed to prove her affirmative defenses.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusions that the appellant did not prove her affirmative defenses by preponderant evidence. With respect to the equitable estoppel affirmative defense, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not establish the second element of an equitable estoppel claim; that is, that she did not establish reasonable reliance on any misconduct by the agency. We agree with the administrative judge's conclusions for the reasons set forth in the initial decision.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The administrative judge did not make a specific finding regarding the first element of equitable estoppel, which requires a finding of affirmative misconduct by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Perez Peraza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). It is not necessary for us to reach it because we affirm the administrative judge's holding that the appellant did not prove the second element by preponderant evidence. Nevertheless, we question the appellant's ability to prove the first element. As evidence of affirmative misconduct, the appellant points to several documents that she sent via email to the agency on which she copied her attorneys and argues that the agency's failure to take action constitutes prior acquiescence to her behavior. She also points to other documents that her attorneys submitted on her behalf. (documents containing the names of the appellant's coworkers); (documents to agency officials that the appellant argues support her whistleblowing affirmative defense). We are not convinced, however, that such argument and evidence indicates that the agency engaged in affirmative misconduct for the purposes of an equitable estoppel affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Perez Peraza</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 10 (the negligent provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge erred in mitigating the appellant's removal to a 60-day suspension.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in weighing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and did not consider the totality of the circumstances when she mitigated the penalty. We agree. The administrative judge found that the deciding official conducted a very thorough review of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, painstakingly reviewed every aspect of the case, and was a very credible witness. Nevertheless, the administrative judge also found that the deciding official failed to properly consider, as a significant mitigating factor with respect to the seriousness of the offense, the fact that the appellant disclosed the information to her attorney. The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 646, as support for the conclusion that the appellant's offenses were significantly mitigated because she shared the documents with her attorney. Although <span class="Italic">Heath</span> states that an employee's motive "may be a mitigating factor" in assessing the seriousness of an offense, it also states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">That the appellant felt he needed to obtain documentation to assist him in defending a performance-based removal action does not significantly mitigate the seriousness of the offense. Procedures are available, both under the Board's discovery regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.71-.75, and under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552, to obtain documents necessary to defend against such an action. We acknowledge the appellant's claim that he was unfamiliar with these procedures at the time he took the documents at issue, but we note that the record does not reflect any attempt on his part to find out whether he had proper avenues of discovery. In any event, the appellant's perceived need to obtain documentation for his defense would in no way justify an indiscriminate search through other employees' desks and papers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 646, 651. Further, the Board in Heath upheld the penalty of removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 650-51. In this case, the fact that the appellant provided the documents to her attorney does not significantly mitigate the seriousness of the offense. The appellant was aware of the ROB, including the specific procedures for producing sensitive information to third parties with appropriate safeguards. The appellant's need to pursue a grievance to challenge a reduced rating in an element of her performance review does not justify an indiscriminate disclosure of documents containing highly sensitive information without utilizing any safeguards. As discussed above, her disclosure of the information was unreasonable under the circumstances. Thus, that the appellant only disclosed the protected information to her attorney is not a significant mitigating factor in this case and does not outweigh the seriousness of the misconduct. Accordingly, we reverse the initial decision's finding with respect to the penalty, and we sustain the removal.</p>

There was no "disclosure" of the records:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Wrocklage's transmission of the TECS report to Ms. Berglund does not constitute a "disclosure" because the undisputed facts of this case are that Ms. Berglund never viewed the TECS report. The Privacy Act does not define the term "disclosure." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a). However, other courts have interpreted this language in a persuasive manner. In <span class="Italic">Luster v.

There, the court concluded that no "disclosure" occurred where a document containing protected information was transmitted to a fax machine but there was no evidence that any unauthorized person actually viewed it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, the court defined the term "disclose" as "the placing into the view of another information which was previously unknown" and concluded that there was no Privacy Act violation where there was no evidence that anyone actually viewed the protected information. 218 F.R.D. 619, 630-31 (E.D. Wis. 2003). Most recently, in <span class="Italic">In re Science Applications International Corp. Backup Tape Data Theft Litigation</span>, the court adopted from Privacy Act authorities what is a "common-sense intuition: If no one has viewed your private information (or is about to view it imminently), then your privacy has not been violated." __F. Supp.2d__, 2014 WL 1858458, at *9 (D.D.C. May 9, 2014). On that basis, the court denied standing to most of the plaintiffs where a thief had acquired tapes containing protected data but there was no allegation, and it was entirely speculative, that the thief had actually viewed their information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We are persuaded that these cases articulate the correct interpretation of disclose or disclosure as requiring not just transmission, but actual viewing or imminent viewing by another.[1] Of course the fact that the record was viewed, like other facts, only needs to be established by a preponderance of the evidence. This would not seem to require identifying a specific viewer. It would be enough to show that someone more likely than not viewed the material. The undisputed facts of this case, however, are that the record went to one person and was not viewed. It is undisputed that the recipient deleted the email and it is therefore not imminently viewable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Because there was no viewing of the TECS report at all, this case does not raise the question whether a "record" is "disclosed" under the Privacy Act once part of it is actually viewed.

The Board explored issues of inadvertent and intentional access to and use of confidential information; First Amendment and Title VII protections for the information, irrespective of its source; and the Fifth Amendment implications of disciplinary action against individuals who share otherwise confidential information with their counsel. The lines of demarcation between information surreptitiously obtained and improperly used and information inadvertently obtained and properly used in the EEO process are not altogether distinct, although the drift of the opinion was toward the protection of confidential information on the theory that the EEO investigative process provides sufficient opportunities to legitimately obtain information to support an EEO complaint. The decision, replete with one concurring and one dissenting opinion (not shown here), sustained a 30-day suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency must prove its charges by a preponderance of the evidence for the Board to sustain the agency's action against the appellant. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)] .

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency alleged that the appellant, without authorization, provided the EEO investigator and his attorney with information regarding Ellison's EEO complaints, that the appellant had no reason to possess the information, and that he was not authorized to use this information to further his own EEO complaint. The appellant's testimony shows that he knew how to handle confidential EEO material, that he did not believe he had authorization to access Ellison's case file, and that it "probably would not be proper" to share this information anonymously. Thus, the agency has shown that the appellant was not authorized to possess the material and that he knew or should have known that Ellison's files were wrongfully breached. Moreover, the agency's Standards of Conduct make clear that the appellant was permitted to discuss the information regarding Ellison's EEO complaints only if the discussion was in the proper discharge of his official duties and that he was permitted to disclose the information only if he received authorization to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board has recognized, "[i]t may well be that, if an employee innocently acquires incriminating documents in the course of pursuing a discrimination complaint, and does not subsequently misuse them, e.g., by disclosing them to a third party other than his attorney, his actions are protected." <span class="Italic">Williams v.

At the same time, an employee's conduct is not necessarily privileged or immune from discipline merely because it concerns a discrimination complaint. <span class="Italic">See Bonanova v. Department of Education</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 294, 299-300 (1991). Rather, the Board "must balance the purpose of the statutory provisions affording protection from at 300. discrimination against Congress's equally manifest desire not to tie the hands of employers in the objective control of personnel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the appellant filed an EEO complaint alleging that the agency's failure to promote him was the result of race discrimination. 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 2. During the discovery phase prior to his EEOC hearing, Williams used his access to agency computer systems to print other employees' workload reports and obtained copies of his co-workers' leave balance records, which had been left in the copy room. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 3. The agency removed Williams for failing to comply with the rules and regulations regarding the authorized access to and disclosure of Social Security systems and records and for violating the Standards of Conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 5. When Williams grieved his removal, the arbitrator found that Williams improperly accessed and disclosed the documents in question but mitigated the penalty to a 90-day suspension because Williams did not do so for personal gain. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6. The Board found no legal error in the arbitrator's finding that Williams committed misconduct warranting discipline, as "[t]here is no question that [Williams] improperly accessed information on the agency computer system, and that he was aware of the rules and regulations related to the security and integrity of that information." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10. The Board rejected Williams's contention that the anti-retaliation provisions of Title VII shielded him from discipline because he accessed and disclosed the documents in question in the course of an EEOC proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 13. The Board found that these protections do not apply when the documents in question are improperly obtained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, an example of protected activity is found in <span class="Italic">Kempcke</span>. There, after the appellant was assigned a computer previously used by a high-ranking human resources officer, he discovered documents that he believed reflected a pattern of age discrimination against himself and others while deleting old files from the computer's hard drive. <span class="Italic">Kempcke</span>, 132 F.3d at 444. Kempcke was fired after he refused a direct order to return the documents and turned them over to his attorney. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In reversing a grant of summary judgment the district court made in the employer's favor, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded that a reasonable factfinder could find that it was unlawful retaliation to fire Kempcke for engaging in protected activity under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 445-47. The court concluded that Kempcke innocently acquired the documents, reasoning that the manner in which he acquired the documents was akin to an employee who was inadvertently copied on an internal memorandum or who discovers a document mistakenly left in an office copier. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 446.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2815"></span>The Board has also recognized, however, that an employee who steals confidential company documents that may evidence discrimination has not engaged in protected activity that would support a retaliation claim if he is discharged for theft. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 13 (citing <span class="Italic">O'Day v.

In determining whether his conduct constituted protected activity under the ADEA, the court applied the same balancing test used to determine whether an employee's conduct constitutes "protected activity" under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 763. Accordingly, the court balanced the purpose of the act to protect persons engaging in reasonable activities opposing discrimination against the desire of Congress not to tie the employer's hands in the control of personnel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court stated that it was "loathe to provide employees an incentive to rifle through confidential files looking for evidence that might come in handy in later litigation" and that the statute "protects reasonable attempts to contest an employer's discriminatory practices; it is not an insurance policy, a license to flaunt company rules or an invitation to dishonest behavior." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 763-64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's responses during the deposition indicate he assumed that the person who accessed Ellison's EEO files and forwarded information from those files acted wrongfully. There is no evidence, however, to show that the appellant obtained the information regarding Ellison's EEO complaints as a result of his own wrongdoing. The agency's report of investigation did show that Ellison's EEO complaints were filed in the Central Region and that several employees in the Central Region knew the appellant on a professional basis; however, the report neither concluded that the appellant requested the information nor made a determination as to how the appellant came to receive the information. Given the limited facts of record, we cannot eliminate the possibility that someone inadvertently directed the documents to the appellant. While the facts of this case present a close call, we find the facts in the record before us to be more analogous to those in <span class="Italic">Kempcke</span> than to those of <span class="Italic">O'Day</span>. For these reasons, we affirm the administrative judge's reversal of Specification 1 of Charge 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleged that the appellant orally provided, both to the EEO investigator and to his attorney private, official government information regarding the details of a proposed removal action against another FAA employee. The agency alleged that the appellant did not obtain this information through the proper channels and was not authorized to use the information to further his EEO complaint. According to the agency, the appellant admitted that he obtained this information while performing his official government duties and used it to suggest a comparable punishment for alleged misconduct by Ellison that the appellant became aware of through the office rumor mill.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the course of his official duties, the appellant responded to a grievance and to a Congressional inquiry related to the proposed removal of an Aviation Safety Inspector based upon a charge of falsification of government documents. Because the appellant believed that Ellison falsified official government forms by identifying himself as a Native American and that Ellison's actions were grounds for removal, he disclosed information about the Aviation Safety Inspector's removal to the EEO investigator and to his representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the facts of the present case are analogous to those in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. The agency maintains that it has the right to control the use of its property and to ensure that agency records are used for the purpose for which they were created. The appellant counters by arguing that it is the EEO investigator's responsibility to "develop an impartial and appropriate factual record" and to gather evidence from whatever source she deems appropriate, including the complainant. Moreover, he asserts that he was instructed to provide information or documents that would support his claims and that his failure to cooperate with the EEO investigator may have subjected him to sanctions, including the dismissal of his case. We find the appellant's arguments unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When asked whether the EEO investigator authorized him to take the information regarding the Air Safety Inspector's removal from the agency files, the appellant responded, "The EEO investigator asked me if I had any documentation to show hostile work environment or where I was being treated differently to provide that information to her. So the answer is yes, she requested me to provide that." For that reason, the appellant asserted, he was authorized to provide the information regarding the Air Safety Inspector's removal to the EEO investigator. In a sworn statement, the appellant indicated that he used the information about the Aviation Safety Inspector's proposed removal "in response to the questions asked by the investigator and part of the remedy that [he] stated [he] was seeking.[2] It was also used to show cited [sic] an example how the Agency should be consistent in their application of penalty for the same offense." He disclosed this information to the investigator because he "had reason to believe that such disclosure was not only appropriate, but required pursuant to the instructions that [he] must cooperate fully with the investigator and disclose all information and/or evidence in [his] possession."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The February 3, 2003 EEO Counselor's Report pertaining to the appellant's non-selection claim indicates that the appellant's requested remedies included that the agency, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, retract Ellison's job offer and place the appellant in the Supervisory Program Analyst position. In an August 2003 statement made in the course of the EEO investigation, the appellant additionally requested that the agency remove Ellison for falsification or providing false or misleading information on an official government document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant relies upon <span class="Italic">Gill v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 23 (2002). Appellant Gill was charged with making an unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in violation of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">Gill</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 16, 20. Specifically, the agency alleged that, during a meeting regarding her EEO complaint, Gill disclosed to the EEO counselor confidential information regarding two of her subordinates. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 16. This information included medical documents, leave applications, a letter of requirement regarding the use of leave, time and attendance records, and a proposed disciplinary action against one of the subordinates. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board reasoned that Gill's disclosure to the EEO counselor related to her claim that she was disparately treated concerning her request for a medical accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 22. The Board concluded that Gill's disclosure to the EEO counselor fell within an exception to the non-disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act that allows disclosure of records to officers of the agency who need the record in the performance of their duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span> The Board further found that the agency had failed to prove that the disclosure was from a system of records. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 23. Thus, the Board determined that the information Gill disclosed was relevant to her disparate impact claim and was made in response to a request of the EEO counselor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot reach the same conclusion in the present case. In the course of his duties, the appellant was entrusted with access to information about proposed disciplinary actions against employees, and the appellant does not deny that he forwarded the information regarding the Air Safety Inspector's proposed removal to the EEO investigator. The appellant's assertion that this document was relevant to his EEO complaint misses the mark. The appellant complained that he was harassed and was not selected for the supervisory position because of his race and prior EEO activity. Because the appellant had not been disciplined for making false statements, the discipline of another employee for that offense was not relevant to his claims. Although the appellant indicated that he sought Ellison's removal as a form of relief in his EEO complaint, he has not shown that Ellison's removal for falsification would be a remedy to which he was entitled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501 (delineating remedies and relief available when discrimination is found).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's disclosure of confidential information regarding the Air Safety Inspector's removal is not protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 13 (citing <span class="Italic">O'Day</span>, 79 F.3d at 763-64). The anti-retaliation provisions do not apply to a situation where the documents at issue are improperly obtained. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also O'Day</span>, 79 F.3d at 763 ("'the purpose of [Title VII] to protect persons engaging <span class="Italic">reasonably</span> in activities opposing...discrimination'"; "[a]n employee's opposition activity is protected only if it is '<span class="Italic">reasonable</span> in view of the employer's interest in maintaining a harmonious and efficient operation'"; that "activity must be '<span class="Italic">reasonable</span> in light of the circumstances'") (emphasis added) (citations omitted). As discussed above, this is not a situation where the appellant innocently came across information which supported his discrimination claim. Further, the agency entrusted the appellant--in the course of performing his duties--with information regarding a proposed disciplinary action, and the appellant needlessly disclosed this information to the EEO investigator. In balancing the purpose of the statutory provisions affording protection from discrimination against Congress's desire not to tie the hands of employers in the control of personnel, we find that the agency has a strong interest in ensuring that information regarding proposed disciplinary actions remains confidential and ensuring that it is able to trust that employees who have access to such information will handle it properly. In addition, the appellant's actions here appear to have been taken in furtherance of a personal campaign to convince the agency to remove Ellison. The appellant cannot rely upon the anti-retaliation provisions as an insurance policy or a license to flaunt agency rules. <span class="Italic">See O'Day</span>, 79 F.3d at 763-64. In balancing the agency's strong interest in maintaining the confidentiality of its personnel records with Congress's purpose to protect persons opposing discrimination, we find that the appellant's conduct does not constitute protected activity. <span id="Page_2816"></span><span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 13.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleged that the appellant provided to DOT EEO investigators and to his attorney documents containing other FAA employees' private and personal information. These documents included: (1) Merit promotion placement (MPP) selection lists; (2) "disciplinary/adverse actions/discussions of named Agency employees including a grievance response"; and (3) a personal memorandum addressed to the appellant's supervisor regarding "Unacceptable Supervisory Oversight." The agency alleged that the appellant did not obtain these documents through proper channels and that he was not authorized to use the information to further his EEO complaint. According to the agency, the appellant obtained the MPP selection lists and the disciplinary/adverse actions/discussions of named agency employees during the course of his duties and obtained the memorandum regarding his supervisor's performance from his supervisor's desk drawer while he was acting for his supervisor. The agency maintained that the appellant's behavior violated its Standards of Conduct regarding the safeguarding and use of information, documents, and records.

The appellant admitted that he attached to his response to interrogatories in his EEO case three MPP lists for positions for which he did not bid. He testified that he would guess that the lists are confidential but that he was not sure. He admitted that another agency employee, such as an Aviation Safety Inspector, would not have authorization to review the MPP lists. The appellant testified in his deposition that the MPP lists were relevant to his EEO claim and that the EEO investigator requested a copy of any merit promotion selection in which Johnson was the selecting official. When he went to a staffing specialist and explained the EEO investigator's request and told the staffing specialist that she could either provide the MPP lists to the EEO investigator or to the appellant, the staffing specialist provided the lists to the appellant. The appellant faxed the lists to the EEO investigator and kept a copy at his home for his own records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the letter that the agency alleged the appellant removed from Ellison's desk drawer, the appellant testified in his deposition that he was acting for Ellison while Ellison was out of the office. Because he needed files that Ellison had in his office, the appellant telephoned Ellison and asked him where the files were. When the appellant went into Ellison's office to retrieve the files, he found a supervisory oversight letter from Johnson to Ellison on top of the files. The appellant read the letter and discovered that it was a negative letter in which Johnson chastised Ellison for poor performance. Walker had informed the appellant that his performance was one of the reasons for his non-selection and that Walker had never had performance issues with Ellison. Believing the letter was relevant to his EEO complaint, the appellant made a copy of it and replaced the original in Ellison's desk. The appellant testified that he originally intended to make notes from the letter that could be used in a deposition. Because he needed to get back to work, the appellant made a copy of it to keep for himself as a "memory jogger." The appellant admitted that his copying of the letter was not an act taken in furtherance of official agency business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In declining to sustain this charge, the administrative judge reasoned that the appellant's use of the documents was not unauthorized because neither the EEO investigator nor the appellant's attorney is an unauthorized person. The administrative judge determined that the appellant's EEO complaint was a public, not a private concern. Thus, she concluded that the manner in which the appellant used the documents was protected activity. As to the memorandum on Ellison's desk, the administrative judge further concluded that the appellant innocently found it in a place where he was authorized to be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the administrative judge failed to consider the circumstances of the appellant's conduct. The agency maintains that "[t]he essence of the charge is that [a]ppellant rifled through [a]gency files to find information and/or documents he believed were relevant to his EEO case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we find that the administrative judge correctly declined to sustain this charge as it pertained to the MPP lists. The appellant admitted that an FAA employee who did not hold his position would not have been permitted to access the MPP lists. Although the appellant was permitted to access MPP lists in the course of his duties, his access to the MPP lists at issue here was outside of his official duties. Nonetheless, we have declined to sustain similar charges under facts analogous to those of the present appeal. <span class="Italic">See Gill</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6; 22. In <span class="Italic">Gill</span>, we reasoned that the appellant "provided the records at the request of an EEO counselor in support of [her] claim that she was disparately treated concerning her request for a medical accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant here testified that the EEO investigator asked him to obtain evidence to show that Johnson had been the selecting official for other positions. The appellant's actions here, like Ms. Gill's, were in response to an explicit request for specific information that the investigator apparently deemed necessary. In view of this unrebutted evidence regarding the investigator's specific request, we decline to sustain this charge as it relates to the MPP lists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do, however, sustain that portion of the charge pertaining to the letter found in Ellison's office. The appellant was entrusted with access to Ellison's office for the limited purpose of removing specific files, and he was not authorized to examine or remove any documents other than those files. The appellant has not provided a satisfactory explanation as to why the information regarding Ellison's performance after his selection was relevant to his EEO claim related to his non-selection for that position. The appellant's use of the memorandum found in Ellison's drawer is not protected activity. Although the record does not establish that the appellant "rifled" through Ellison's drawers in search of evidence, we find that he had access to Ellison's office for the express purpose of removing files he needed to perform his duties. We decline to find that the appellant's actions are protected activity where the memorandum was improperly obtained. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 13. Because the memorandum concerned Ellison's performance <span class="Italic">after</span> his selection, the appellant's use of the information in the memorandum is not a reasonable action taken to contest the alleged discrimination. <span class="Italic">See O'Day</span>, 79 F.3d at 763-64. Accordingly, we sustain Charge 2 as it pertains to the appellant's use of the memorandum found in Ellison's desk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Charge 3: Unauthorized removal and possession of a personal government document</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleged that the appellant removed from his supervisor's drawer a memorandum addressed to his supervisor and titled "Unacceptable Supervisory Oversight." It further alleged that the appellant removed the document to photocopy it for his personal use and that there was no official reason or permission granted for the appellant to take this document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that the memorandum was clearly not intended for the appellant's possession but she concluded that the appellant came by the document lawfully. The administrative judge found that the facts of this case were distinguishable from cases in which the Board sustained similar charges because the appellant here did not improperly access the memorandum. She reasoned that the facts of the present case were analogous to those in <span class="Italic">Kempcke</span>, and that the appellant's provision of the memo to the EEO investigator and his attorney was protected activity for which he cannot be disciplined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency argues that the administrative judge failed to address the appellant's secretive conduct in removing the letter and making a copy of it for his own use. The agency maintains that the Board has previously sustained charges against an employee who, like the appellant here, knowingly made and retained photocopies of documents that he knew he should not have. PFR at 16-17 (citing <span class="Italic">Heath v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 638 (1994)). The agency further argues that the appellant took agency documents for personal reasons, specifically to support his claims that he was discriminated against during the selection process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, the agency removed the appellant based on charges of violating the Privacy Act and committing theft of government property in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 641 when he photocopied and removed from the agency's premises a list of employee names and social security numbers, case review sheets, and an office personnel roster. <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 641-42. Heath provided these documents to his attorney for use in his Board appeal of a prior performance-based removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that Heath's actions constituted a serious violation of the agency's right to control the use of its property. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 646. The Board further explained that the records at issue contained sensitive and personal information and that the appellant's actions interfered with the agency's responsibility to ensure that such records were used only for the official government purposes for which they were created. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's actions here raise similar concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence discussed under Charge 2 shows that the appellant admitted taking the document, photocopying it, and keeping a copy for himself. Thus, the agency has met its burden to prove its allegation <span id="Page_2817"></span>by preponderant evidence. Moreover, for the reasons discussed under Charge 2, we conclude that the appellant was not engaging in protected activity when he copied the letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">First Amendment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the agency's disciplinary action violated his First Amendment rights. The appellant maintained that challenging the agency's discriminatory practices was a matter of public concern and that it was the substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision to discipline him. The administrative judge, having declined to sustain any of the charges, did not address the appellant's First Amendment claim. Because we have sustained some of the charges, we will address this claim now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has recognized that public employees, like all citizens, enjoy a constitutionally protected interest in freedom of speech. <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983); <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Educ.</span>, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968); <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 33 (2006). Employees' free speech rights must be balanced, however, against the need of government agencies to exercise "'wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.'" <span class="Italic">Mings v. Department of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 387 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (quoting <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 146); <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 33. Thus, in determining the free speech rights of government employees, a balance must be struck between the interest of the employees, as citizens, in commenting on matters of public concern, and the interest of the government, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">Pickering</span>, 391 U.S. at 568; <span class="Italic">Mings</span>, 813 F.2d at 387; <span class="Italic">Sigman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 352, 355 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 868 F.2d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). In addressing the issue of whether employee speech is protected by the First Amendment, the Board must determine: (1) Whether the speech addressed a matter of public concern and, if so, (2) whether the agency's interest in promoting the efficiency of the service outweighs the employee's interest as a citizen. <span class="Italic">Ledeaux v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 440, 445 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Speech that relates to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community may be considered a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 146. Courts must examine the "content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record" to determine whether the speech qualifies as a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 147-48. In determining whether an employee's speech relates to a matter of public concern or to his own private interest, courts also consider the employee's attempts to make the concern public and the employee's motivation in speaking. <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Bowden</span>, 105 F.3d 1344, 1353 (11th Cir. 1997). Certainly, a discussion regarding racial relations or discrimination is a matter of public concern entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 148 n.8 (speech protesting racial discrimination is "inherently of public concern"). In contrast, however, an EEO matter where the complaint is personal in nature and limited to the complainant's own situation is not a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Saulpaugh v. Monroe Cmty. Hosp</span>., 4 F.3d 134, 143 (2d Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's EEO complaint alleged that he was not selected for the supervisory position as a result of racial discrimination and that he and other African-Americans in his division were subject to a hostile environment. The appellant's claim that he and other African-Americans in his division were subject to a hostile environment is arguably a matter of public concern. The appellant's actions for which he was disciplined, however, were not taken to further his protest of any broad discriminatory policies or practices of the agency or in an attempt to remedy pervasive discrimination; rather, some of the acts for which the appellant was disciplined related to his complaint that his non-selection resulted from racial discrimination. The appellant's other actions, such as his removal and copying of the memo in Ellison's office and his use of the Air Safety Inspector's proposed removal, do not relate to the appellant's EEO claim and were used in what appears to be the appellant's personal campaign to have Ellison removed. The appellant made no attempt to show that the actions for which he was suspended related to his claim that all African-American employees in his division were subject to a hostile environment. Thus, the appellant's speech here was personal in nature, limited to his own situation, and is not a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Saulpaugh</span>, 4 F.3d at 143.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If we were to assume, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the appellant's speech addressed a matter of public concern, we would find that the agency's interest in promoting the efficiency of the service outweighs the appellant's interest as a citizen. As noted in the notice of proposed suspension, in his position as a Labor Relations Program Manager, the appellant was entrusted with access to confidential or sensitive information on an almost daily basis. Given the appellant's actions and the fact that he did not believe he had done anything wrong, the agency was rightfully concerned that the appellant demonstrated "a fundamental lack of understanding of [his] job responsibilities." We agree with the deciding official's concern that the appellant's actions adversely impacted the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant. Thus, we find that the agency's action did not violate the appellant's First Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fifth Amendment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued below that the agency violated his right to due process guaranteed under the Fifth Amendment. He maintained that the Fifth Amendment right to due process implicitly guarantees the right to retain counsel in civil litigation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Potashnick v. Port City Constr. Co.</span>, 609 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1980)). According to the appellant, "by requiring pre-clearance of documents and information, and thereby restricting the free flow of communications between [the appellant] and his attorney, the [a]gency is effectively precluding [the appellant] from obtaining sound legal advice on the merits or viability of his claim." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has concluded that the right to retain counsel in civil litigation is implicit in the concept of Fifth Amendment due process. <span class="Italic">Potashnick</span>, 609 F.2d at 1117. Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has reasoned that a client's interest in speaking freely with his attorney is interwoven with the right to effective assistance of counsel, and restrictions on speech between attorneys and their clients directly undermine the attorney's ability to provide sound legal advice. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Lauer</span>, 686 F.2d 24, 32 (D.C. Cir. 1982). However, our research has not uncovered a case in which our reviewing court has found a general constitutional right to counsel in civil matters, and the Board is not bound by the decisions of the Fifth Circuit, the District of Columbia Circuit, or United States district courts. <span class="Italic">See Morgan v. Department of Energy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 15 n.2 (1999); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 76, 79 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the cases upon which the appellant relies are inapposite to the appellant's Fifth Amendment argument in this matter. <span class="Italic">Potashnick</span>, for example, concerned a trial court judge's ruling prohibiting a witness from consulting with his attorney in recesses that occurred during his testimony. 609 F.2d at 1117. Specifically, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the ruling:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">prohibited "any further conversations" with a witness once his testimony commenced, and the application of the rule barred the president and sole shareholder of defendant Port City from talking to his attorney for a period of seven days, including several overnight recesses. Judge Hand's denial of any attorney-client communication for such an extended period of time resulted in a significant deprivation of the effective assistance of counsel and thus impinged upon Port City's constitutional right to retain counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1119. Thus, <span class="Italic">Potashnick</span> did not address the Fifth Amendment argument at issue here. The other cases upon which the appellant relies were decided on First Amendment grounds, rather than the due process issue upon which the appellant bases his Fifth Amendment argument. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 686 F.2d at 32 n.36; <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Schiffer</span>, 47 F. Supp.2d 16, 24 (D.D.C. 1999), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, 204 F.3d 259 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant had other legal avenues available to him to obtain information and documents relevant to his EEO complaint. He did not need to resort to taking documents containing the private information of other agency employees himself. The appellant only had access to such information and documents by virtue of his position as a Labor Relations Program Manager. Other employees would have had to follow a different path to obtain this information, and it was inappropriate for the appellant to use his official position to gain an advantage that other employees with EEO complaints would not have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead of taking the information and documents himself, the appellant could have utilized the EEO investigation process. The regulations pertaining to that process provide a means by which a claimant may explain his theory of the case, and an EEO investigator may obtain official government information or documents relevant to that claim. The regulations specify that an investigator with the appropriate security clearances shall conduct the investigation and require that the agency grant routine access to personnel records in connection with an investigation and produce all evidence the investigator deems necessary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1614.102(b)(6), 1614.108(c)(1), (d). Here, the appellant, by reason of the access his position provided to sensitive information contained in the agency's personnel files, circumvented the EEO investigative process and essentially conducted his own unauthorized investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the suits in <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, cases the appellant cites in support of his Fifth Amendment argument, arose because the employees in those cases realized that they could be subject to discipline for sharing sensitive agency information with their attorneys. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 686 F.2d at 26-28; <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, 47 F. Supp.2d at 17-18. The <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span> courts determined that the employees could share agency information with their attorneys while still protecting the government's interests, as <span id="Page_2818"></span>long as certain safeguards were in place. For example, in <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, the court noted from the outset that the case involved only oral communications with counsel and not the transmittal of government documents and that there was no evidence that the information would be provided to persons other than the employees' attorney. 686 F.2d at 27 n.5. The court reasoned that, under the Code of Professional Responsibility, the employees' attorney could not disclose the matters discussed without their authorization and that the government could require the employees not to authorize such a disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 34. In <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, the court found that "Mr. Jacobs could show his attorney some, if not all, of the documents that he would like to disclose without violating any statute or regulation." 47 F. Supp.2d at 20. The court further noted that, if the government's interests could not be protected by simply requiring Mr. Jacobs to instruct his attorney to keep all non-public information confidential, the government could seek a court order directing the attorney to do so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 23-24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who by virtue of his Labor Relations Program Manager position should have known to proceed cautiously when using the sensitive information at issue in this appeal, made no attempt to work with the agency or the courts to protect this information while pursuing his EEO complaint, as the litigants in <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> and <span class="Italic">Martin</span> did. By the time the agency became aware of the appellant's actions, it was too late to allow the appellant to share information with his attorney while taking precautions such as those outlined in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> and <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>. For example, the appellant testified in his deposition that he tried to make copies of the documents that were eventually the subject of the agency's charges to keep in a file at his home. It is not clear from the record what precautions, if any, the appellant took to safeguard this information when he transported it to his home and while he stored it there. This information potentially could be accessed by third parties who would not be bound by the Code of Professional Responsibility to keep it confidential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contended that the required pre-clearance of documents and information would restrict the free flow of communications between the appellant and his attorney and would preclude him from obtaining sound legal advice on the merits of his claim. The above discussion shows that the appellant could have communicated with his attorney while still protecting the agency's interests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that in <span class="Italic">Martin</span> and <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, the courts balanced the interests of the employee as a citizen with those of the government as an employer in a First Amendment analysis. <span class="Italic">See Martin</span>, 686 F.2d at 31-32; <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, 47 F. Supp.2d at 21. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that such a balancing test would apply in a Fifth Amendment context, we note that we performed this balancing test to resolve the appellant's First Amendment claim and concluded that his First Amendment rights were not violated. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 45-49. We also performed a similar balancing test to determine whether the appellant engaged in protected EEO activity and found that, with regard to the sustained charges and specifications, the appellant's actions were not reasonable actions taken to contest discrimination. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28, 37.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree that a claimant has a strong interest in being able to speak freely with his attorney regarding his EEO complaint. Yet, as we noted in our discussion on the merits of the charges, some of the information and documents at issue in this appeal were of limited or no relevance to the appellant's EEO complaint, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27, 37, and the appellant, by virtue of his position as a Labor Relations Program Manager, knew or should have known this. The appellant's interests must be balanced against the agency's interest in protecting sensitive information regarding personnel matters. Agency employees who wish to file a grievance or who may be subjected to a proposed disciplinary action rightfully expect that the agency will protect any sensitive information contained in their files. If we were to accept the appellant's Fifth Amendment argument, agency employees may be reluctant to avail themselves of the opportunity to file a grievance or EEO complaint, or to respond to a proposed disciplinary action, as they could not be assured that their sensitive information would remain confidential. In fact, all private employee information contained in the agency's files could potentially be taken and used by employees with access to the information for their own purposes. We cannot approve such a result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In balancing the interests of the appellant in discussing the merits of his EEO complaint with his attorney against the interests of the agency in protecting sensitive information, we conclude that, under the unique facts of this case, and particularly considering the manner in which the appellant obtained and handled the sensitive information, some of which was of little or no relevance to his EEO complaint, the agency's interest in protecting official government information outweighs the appellant's interests. The appellant could have obtained the information relevant to his EEO complaint through proper channels and then communicated that information to his attorney. Thus, for all the reasons discussed above, we decline to find that the suspension based on the sustained charges violated the appellant's Fifth Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Discrimination on the Basis of EEO Activity</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the suspension was retaliatory because he was disciplined for engaging in protected EEO activity. He further maintained that there was a link between his protected activity and his suspension because the suspension ultimately resulted from Ellison's request for an investigation into the disclosure of sensitive information from his EEO complaints. According to the appellant, Walker has a propensity to initiate investigations of employees who file EEO complaints. The appellant asserted that Walker tried to convince John Allen, Deputy Director, Flight Standards Service, who acted as the proposing and deciding official, that the appellant made false statements and that Ellison urged Allen to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's provision of the information and documents at issue to his attorney and the EEO investigator was protected activity. According to the administrative judge, the agency knew of the activity and disciplined the appellant for providing information to the EEO investigator and his attorney; thus, there was a genuine nexus between the protected activity and the employment action. She further reasoned that the agency would not have brought Charge 4 against the appellant if it were not so upset with the appellant regarding his protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an appellant to establish a claim of retaliation for filing prior EEO complaints, he must show that: (1) He engaged in EEO activity; (2) the accused official knew of such activity; (3) the adverse action under review could, under the circumstances, have been retaliation; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Otterstedt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 21 (2004). Where, as here, the record is complete, the Board will not inquire as to whether the action under review "could have been" retaliatory, but will proceed to the ultimate question, which is whether, upon weighing the evidence presented by both parties, the appellant has met his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the action under appeal was retaliatory. <span class="Italic">See Simien v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 28 (2005). To establish a genuine nexus between the protected activity and the adverse action, the appellant must prove that the action was taken because of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6; 12. This requires the Board to weigh the intensity of the motive to retaliate against the gravity of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The fact that the Board does not sustain the charges against the appellant does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> indicate that the motive to retaliate outweighed the gravity of the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otterstedt</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 23. Rather, the Board must consider the gravity of the misconduct as it appeared to the deciding official at the time he took the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant engaged in protected activity by filing an EEO complaint and that, as a result of the nature of the charges Allen was aware of the protected activity. Allen's application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors makes clear that the sustained misconduct caused the agency to lose trust in the appellant and his ability to safeguard sensitive personnel and EEO materials. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 587, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 12 (appellant's actions in providing his attorney for EEOC proceedings with workload reports accessed from agency computer systems and co-workers' leave balance records found in copy room "represents a serious violation of public trust"). Allen testified in his deposition that "HR" advised him during the proposal and notice process. According to Allen, HR presented him with information showing that the appellant's actions conflicted with the Standards of Conduct. He further explained that the penalty for the appellant's actions ranged from a 14-day suspension to a removal and that HR had advised that the appellant's removal was warranted. Allen opined that the appellant's conduct was serious and that the appellant's actions in "doing whatever he needed to do to further his own case at the expense of others' private property, private information" raised concerns regarding the appellant's character. For these reasons, we conclude that the appellant's conduct appeared serious in Allen's view.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments focus on Ellison's and Walker's attempts to influence Allen. Ellison admitted that he met with Allen before the disciplinary action was imposed and that he "was trying desperately to influence Mr. Allen to terminate [the appellant's] employment." Ellison testified in his deposition that Allen came to the Southern region for a managers meeting and agreed to meet with Ellison for 10 minutes. Ellison told Allen that he was concerned about the appellant's returning to the work area because he did not trust the appellant and asked why he was not involved in the disciplinary process. Allen informed Ellison that he was not involved because he was too close to the situation and that it was being handled in Washington. According to Ellison, Allen "made it very clear that it was going to be his decision." Ellison also spoke to Walker about why he was not involved in the process. Walker explained that the matter was being handled in Washington, he did not know anything about the process, and he could not answer Ellison's questions. Allen testified in his deposition that Walker attempted to convince him <span id="Page_2819"></span>that the EEOC judge erred in not crediting his version of the incident with Spaulding, and it is possible that this lobbying by Walker could have influenced Allen to sustain Charge 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the evidence summarized above, we find that Ellison's and Walker's attempts to influence Allen's decision were unsuccessful, and we find no evidence that Allen had a motive to retaliate against the appellant for his filing an EEO complaint against Walker. Further, although we have not sustained all of the charges, we find that the evidence of the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct that was before Allen at the time he made his decision was sufficient to outweigh any motive to retaliate against him and that there was no genuine nexus between the appellant's EEO activity and the suspension. <span class="Italic">See Otterstedt</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 21. Although we did find that some of conduct with which the appellant was charged constituted protected activity, the record makes clear that the agency had legitimate reasons for taking disciplinary action as to the remaining charges. For all these reasons, we conclude that the agency had legitimate reasons for suspending the appellant. Thus, we reverse that portion of the initial decision finding that the agency retaliated against the appellant for his EEO activities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On further review, the EEOC sanctioned the agency for failure to provide evidence of treatment of similarly situated employees, found discrimination and reprisal as a result of the adverse inference drawn as a sanction, <span class="Italic">Smith v. LaHood</span>, EEOC 032008085 (3/21/12), and sent the case back to the Board "to consider all remedies appropriate with such a finding under Title VII." On return of the case, the suspension against Mr. Smith was set aside, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> AT-0752-05-0901-E-1 (NP 4/25/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for EEOC review of the Board's findings. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.157. In a January 3, 2008 decision, the EEOC determined that the record was incomplete and referred the case to the Board for the taking of additional evidence regarding the types of discipline other employees received for similar infractions and a copy of the agency's Standards of Conduct. Based on the supplemented record developed in this case and forwarded to the EEOC, the EEOC issued a March 21, 2012 decision finding that the agency discriminated against the appellant on the basis of reprisal for prior protected EEO activity when it issued the 30-day suspension. The EEOC found that, although the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal and the agency articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its action, the agency elected not to provide comparative treatment evidence requested by the EEOC because it believed it was "unfair" to canvass its offices to search for other violations of the human resources policy manual the appellant allegedly violated. Under these circumstances, the EEOC exercised its discretion to sanction the agency for its noncompliance by drawing an adverse inference that the requested comparative evidence would have reflected unfavorably on the agency by showing that the agency disciplined employees for unauthorized disclosure of government information more harshly when such disclosure occurred in the EEO process. The EEOC concluded that drawing such an adverse inference was sufficient to establish a pretext in the appellant's retaliation claim and to prove reprisal discrimination. The EEOC returned the case to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(5)(B) for consideration of "all remedies appropriate with such a finding under Title VII."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 471, 486 (Spec. Panel 1986), the Special Panel held that the Board is permitted to disagree with the EEOC only as to misinterpretations of civil service law. Thus, the Board may not force Special Panel review of an EEOC decision because of a disagreement on discrimination law unless the EEOC decision depends upon civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Parks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 6 (2008); <span class="Italic">Randel v. Department of the Navy,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 288, 290 (1996); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.162(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the EEOC decision rests solely on an interpretation of discrimination law. Further, the EEOC decision is not so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. Thus, under Ignacio, the Board lacks the authority to disagree with the EEOC's decision. We therefore CONCUR IN and ADOPT the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.162(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Misuse of EEO records in violation of a Privacy Act warning was determined to support adverse action on a "conduct unbecoming" charge, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. DOD</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1524.Opinion.2-13-2019.pdf">760 Fed. Appx. 990, 992, 994-95</a> (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In 2015, Ryan filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), concerning his employment with the PFPA, which is not at issue in this appeal. In the course of that proceeding, Ryan was required to sign a Notice of Rights and Responsibilities for the EEOC complaint process. By signing the notice, Ryan was given access to a Report of Investigation ("ROI") from the EEOC, which contained the personnel file of another police officer ("SV"). The ROI included the following warning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">v.&#x2003;The ROI contains personal data and is to be treated in a confidential manner. <span class="Italic">You may not show your copy of the ROI, in whole or in part, to a third party except your designated representative.</span> Violations of privacy safeguards may result in disciplinary action, a fine of up to $5,000, or both (Public Law 93-576).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ryan did not heed this warning. Instead, he sent a copy of SV's personnel file to eight members of the PFPA, as well as the PFPA Office of Professional Responsibility, as an attachment to an October 12, 2016, memorandum in which he asserted that SV received a fraudulent cash bonus of $2,050 from a sergeant "in exchange for allowing [SV's duty post] to become a location for unauthorized congregating, food delivery, and eating to take place." Ryan had previously reported SV and others on separate occasions for such unauthorized congregating around SV's duty post.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find Ryan's arguments unavailing. Ryan signed an EEOC notice which clearly warned him that distribution of SV's personnel file was a violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, and PFPA Order 1000.3 makes clear that "[v]iolation of any law, regulation or order may be grounds for disciplinary action." Both the DO and the AJ were thus entitled to credit testimony that Ryan's cavalier attitude toward the Privacy Act and EEOC rules rendered him a liability to the PFPA, where officers must abide by similar laws to perform their jobs. Furthermore, the record is clear that Ryan was aware that he was barred from sharing SV's personnel file. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 1290 ("[The EEO Director] said you cannot share other people's information."). Thus, Ryan has not shown that the AJ's finding that he committed conduct unbecoming a police officer was unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
