<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not require that a party obtain a copy of the hearing transcript before it files a PFR, or that it cite specific pages of the transcript. <span class="Italic">Sadowski v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 461, 462 n.* (1985). If one wants a transcript, the Board grants an extension request if the request is filed before the PFR deadline (because a stenographic firm does not timely prepare a transcript), and the request may be renewed if transcript preparation continues to be delayed for a short time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 175 (1989) (PFR was timely; additional time was allowed for supplemental documents based on the delayed receipt of a transcript from the former representative); <span class="Italic">Wenzel v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 33 MSPR 344, 349 (1987) (granting one extension and denying another based on transcript delays and other problems). But lateness of a PFR caused by waiting for a transcript is an inadequate cause for delay. <span class="Italic">Steele v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 327, 329 (1990); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 91 MSPR 239, 244 &#x00B6; 9 (2002) (once the Board stopped providing extensions to obtain hearing tapes, a late PFR was not excused for the failure to obtain tapes; a PFR need not include a copy of the hearing transcript); <span class="Italic">Green-Victory v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 272, 274 (1997) (good cause for a delayed PFR was not shown by an appellant who averred that she was waiting for the transcript to determine the conditions of her settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 284, 289 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 241 (2010) ("Although the transcript of the statement made by the appellant's supervisor on March 8, 2010, was unavailable at the time the record closed, the information contained in the document (i.e., the supervisor's recollection of events that took place in 2008 and 2009) was available before the close of the record. We therefore find that the transcript is not new evidence satisfying the standard set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(i), and we will not further consider the appellant's submission filed on May 5, 2010."), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Harding v. VA</span>, 451 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-113.html#sec3-113">Hearing Recording Omissions; Transcript Errors</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board may grant an extension to file a PFR while the transcript is being prepared, the Board is not likely to excuse a late PFR by reason of the interest in security a transcript by the party filing the PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 87, 90 n.2 (1996) (noting that a delay in the receipt of a transcript would not furnish good cause for the belated filing of a PFR because "the Board's regulations do not require a petition for review to be accompanied by a copy of the hearing transcript."); <span class="Italic">Berryman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 108 (1989) (good cause was not shown by an appellant who sought a transcript from the agency but who did not detail her efforts to obtain the transcript or provide any reason for failing to request an extension to file her response); <span class="Italic">Marie v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 244 (1985) ("We find that appellant's decision to delay filing her petition for review because she wanted to forward a copy of the hearing transcript does not establish good cause for her untimely filing."); <span class="Italic">Vowell v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 646, 648 &#x0026; n.2 (1983) (although the appellant argued that delay in filing the PFR was caused by difficulties obtaining hearing transcript, the appellant had not requested extension of time prior to the expiration of filing deadline). Nor is an untimely PFR excused by difficulty obtaining the transcript of the hearing if both the appellant and the representative were present at the hearing and can narrate in the PFR any specific testimony that the Board should examine. <span class="Italic">Blalock v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 545, 547 (1984). A long-delayed PFR was not excused because the Board lost a tape of a prehearing conference. <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 96 MSPR 1, 2 &#x00B6; 6 (2003).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant explains in his petition for review that it was filed after the regulatory deadline because Veterans Administration ("V.A.") hospital personnel, from whom he sought material information, were on vacation and he needed time to make doctors' appointments for relevant documentation. The appellant submitted documents from the VA and from physicians, along with his petition for review. In its response, the agency did not challenge the petition as untimely. Since it appears that the appellant was diligent in gathering further statements in support of his petition but apparently was confronted in doing so with time delays occasioned by vacation and appointment schedules beyond his control, and since we can discern no prejudice resulting to the agency from the 28-day delay in filing, the Board finds good cause under the circumstances of the appellant's case to waive the regulatory deadline for filing a petition for review under 5 C.F.R.
