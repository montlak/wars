<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-60"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">KANG</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">After the D.C. Circuit decisions, the "excessive interference" test was first applied only to cases remanded to FLRA by that court. But in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 25 (1986) (referred to throughout this <span class="Italic">Guide</span> as <span class="Italic">KANG</span>), FLRA examined the test to determine its broader applicability. FLRA restated the issue resulting from the <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782</span> decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding that case the Court rejected the so-called "direct interference" test previously applied by the Authority in evaluating the negotiability of matters described as "appropriate arrangements" under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. While that Court had previously sustained the application of that test as to "procedures" under section 7106(b)(2), it had not had an opportunity to address its applicability to "appropriate arrangements." In rejecting "direct interference" as an analytical device in section 7106(b)(3) cases, the Court enunciated a standard which requires an analysis of whether "excessive interference" with a right reserved to management would result from implementation of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA decided to make the excessive interference test one of general application, doing so in the context of a proposal that if management decides to fill a vacant position it will do so with an employee of the highest retention standing, should two or more employees demoted from the position in a RIF compete for the position. The effect of the proposal was to require the repromotion of the employee with the highest retention standard before employees with lower standing. There was agreement by the parties that there was no issue as to qualifications. The individual would be repromoted into a position he or she previously filled. Under <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this and future cases where the Authority addresses a management allegation that a union proposal of appropriate arrangements is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with management rights described in section 7106(a) or (b)(1), the Authority will consider whether such an arrangement is appropriate for negotiation within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) or, whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In making that determination, the Authority will first examine the record in each case to ascertain as a threshold question whether a proposal is in fact intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affect by management's exercise of its rights. In order to address this threshold question, the union should identify the management right or effects or foreseeable effects on employees which flow from the exercise of those rights, and how those effects are adverse. In other words, a union must articulate how employees will be detrimentally affected by management's actions and how the matter proposed for bargaining is intended to address or compensate for the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the exercise of the management right or rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the Authority has concluded that a proposal is in fact intended as an arrangement, the Authority will then determine whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes. This will be accomplished, as suggested by the D.C. Circuit, by weighing the competing practical needs of employees and managers. In balancing these needs, the Authority will consider such factors as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;What is the nature and extent of the impact experienced by the adversely affected employees, that is, what conditions of employment are affected and to what degree?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;To what extent are the circumstances giving rise to the adverse affects within an employee's control?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For example, compare <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 and Bureau of the Census</span>, Decision and Order on Remand, 14 FLRA 801 (1984) (proposal applies to employees demoted through no fault of their own) with <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board Union and National Labor Relations Board, Office of the General Counsel</span>, 18 FLRA No. 42 (1985) (proposal concerned employees management proposed to demote or terminate due to demonstrated inability or unwillingness to perform acceptably).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union requests that the Authority reverse this well-established excessive&#8209;interference standard in negotiability cases involving proposals. According to the Union, the Authority should adopt, in those cases, an "abrogation" standard where the agency must show that the proposal would "preclude management from ultimately acting" to exercise its management rights. Specifically, the Union argues that the legislative intent of &#x00A7; 7106 "was to expand the scope of bargaining while protecting the right of federal agencies to 'ultimately exercise' certain management prerogatives." The Union also argues that, based on the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7106, "[u]nions retain the right to bargain over appropriate arrangements, within the bounds of the definitions of those terms and without waiving management's ultimate right to act." Further, the Union contends that an abrogation standard would resolve "legal and practical problems inherent with the existing negotiability standards" by: (1) being "<span class="Italic">more</span> consistent with the plain language and legislative history of" &#x00A7; 7106; (2) putting the parties on notice "that a union proposal would be presumed negotiable unless an agency can show that the proposal would abrogate its rights," "rather than push[ing] parties into engaging in...excessive[-]interference [arguments] and into litigation"; (3) "promot[ing] broad collective bargaining by placing the burden on the parties to resolve" negotiability disputes at the "bargaining table," and through impasse procedures, rather than encouraging agencies to "raise[e] legal objections at the start" of negotiations; and (4) being consistent with the Authority's precedent concerning agreed-upon contract provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority precedent rejecting similar requests in the past, we reject the Union's request that we abandon the excessive-interference test in negotiability cases involving proposals.[22] This test has been consistently applied by the Authority for nearly thirty years and has been upheld by courts.[23] In fact, in adopting the excessive&#8209;interference test in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority referenced the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>,[24] and stated that the court "enunciated a standard[,] which requires an analysis of whether 'excessive interference' with a right reserved to management would result from implementation of the proposal."[25] The Union's arguments provide no basis for finding that the excessive-interference test is inconsistent with the plain wording or legislative intent of &#x00A7; 7106, or that an abrogation standard (in the context of negotiability cases involving proposals) would be more consistent with &#x00A7; 7106's wording and legislative intent. Therefore, in applying the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> test in this case, we apply the excessive&#8209;interference standard.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...Applying this standard, the Authority has found that a proposal that "absolutely require[s]" that a management right be exercised in a particular manner, without "any provision for exceptions or the weighing of individual circumstances[,]" and without "allow[ing] [the agency to] assess[&#8197;] the effect of the proposal's requirements on the [a]gency's ability to conduct its operations effectively and efficiently[,]" places a "significant burden on the [a]gency." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ.

<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit added some guidance for those struggling with the appropriate arrangements test in the context of a proposal, determined to be nonnegotiable, requiring management to avoid terminating an employee for unacceptable performance unless the supervisor found the employee incapable of performing any other position in the agency, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/306/1710166/">819 F.2d 306</a>, 308-09 (D.C. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal advances an appropriate arrangement for adversely affected employees, the decisionmaker applies a different test. Assuming that the proposal, as a threshold matter, suggests an arrangement for adversely affected employees, the decisionmaker must ask whether implementation of the proposed arrangement would "impinge upon management prerogatives to an excessive degree." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 702 F.2d 1183, 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1983). If implementation of the proposed arrangement would not interfere excessively with managerial prerogatives, it is appropriate and therefore negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the distinction between these two tests [negotiable proposals and arrangements] may not be immediately apparent, it is nonetheless real. Excessive interference is something more than direct interference: implementation of a proposal may interfere directly with management prerogatives, yet the interference may not be excessive. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 702 F.2d at 1187-88. The determination whether an interference with managerial prerogatives is excessive depends primarily on the extent to which the interference hampers the ability of an agency to perform its core functions--to get its work done in an efficient and effective way. Thus, if implementation of a proposal will directly interfere with substantive managerial rights, but will not significantly hamper the ability of an agency to get its job done, the proposal is not negotiable as a procedure, but is negotiable (assuming the threshold test described above is met) as an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit added no clarity to the arrangements negotiability equation in a nonprecedential decision that injected an analytical standard that was worded differently than <span class="Italic">KANG,</span> in <span class="Italic">NWSEO v. FLRA,</span> 197 Fed. Appx. 1, 1-2 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">To help employees dealing with the increased workload caused by the National Weather Service's decision to switch to a new computerized weather forecasting system, the National Weather Service Employees Organization (the "Union") proposed that the National Weather Service <span id="page_585"></span>("NWS") increase staffing at its Anchorage Weather Forecast Office ("WFO"). After the NWS refused to negotiate over the proposal, the Union petitioned the Authority for review. The Authority dismissed the petition for review, holding that the proposal was not an "appropriate arrangement," and, consequently, not negotiable. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) (requiring that management bargain with union officials over "<span class="Italic">appropriate arrangements </span>for employees adversely affected by" management's exercise of its authority to determine the organization and number of employees) (emphasis added). The Authority reached this decision after concluding that the Union's proposal would interfere with management rights by "leaving the Agency with no discretion as to the numbers and types of staff to assign to the Anchorage WFO." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 61 F.L.R.A. No. 46, 243 (2005). Because the Authority concluded that this burden on management "outweighs any benefit [the proposal would have had for] employees," it held that the proposal was not an "appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority did not, however, consider whether the proposal would have hampered the ability of the agency to get its job done in an effective and efficient manner. The Union now petitions this Court for review, arguing, among other things, that the Authority erred by failing to consider this factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Union.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 v.

Cir. 1987). Thus, assuming the proposal is an "arrangement"--which neither side disputes is the case here--"if implementation of [the] proposal will directly interfere with substantive managerial rights, <span class="Italic">but will not significantly hamper the ability of an agency to get its job done</span>, the proposal...is negotiable...as an appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

At 310 (emphasis added). The Authority did not make this examination here.

<p class="noindent-1">When determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority has recognized that an appropriate arrangement may not "negate" the exercise of a management right by reversing management's substantive decision altogether.[25] Here, the Agency has prescribed the uniform that technicians will wear while performing their civilian duties, and the proposal attempts to negate that choice by allowing a different uniform "<span class="Italic">at the technician's discretion</span>."

<p class="noindent-1">As the majority has repeatedly reaffirmed, "in the negotiability context, to determine whether a union proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute...[, the Authority applies a] 'balancing' excessive-interference test."[2] And the majority has a detailed understanding of what that test entails. As the majority explained in a recent decision: "When determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an 'arrangement' for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. If the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. The Authority makes this determination by weighing 'the competing practical needs of employees and managers' in order to ascertain whether the benefits to employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the proposal's burdens on the exercise of the management right involved."[3] This analytical framework is often referred to as the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis.[4] All of the Authority's various panels of Members, and the federal courts,[5] have applied the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis since 1986; that is, for over thirty years.</p>

Nov. 6, 2018); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">So, is the Authority's thirty-something <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis alive and well? If the majority's decision in this case is a reliable indicator, the answer is "No." With only the briefest discussion, the majority effectively jettisons the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> excessive-interference balancing analysis, and replaces it with a lopsided "negates" test. Adopting a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule, the majority holds that "an appropriate arrangement may not 'negate' the exercise of a management right by reversing management's substantive decision altogether." As the majority explains, under their new "negates" test, "there are no benefits to employees that could, on balance, render an arrangement 'appropriate' if it totally negates management's substantive decision," regardless of how limited or inconsequential that management decision is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority's new, unexplained "negates" test has no foundation in the Statute or the Authority's case law. The four cases the majority cites, from the thousands the Authority has issued, do not support the majority's new test. In three of the cases, the Authority's observation that the disputed proposal would "negate" a management determination was only one factor among many in the Authority's application of the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> balancing test.[9] And in the fourth case, decided shortly after the Authority issued <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority applied an "abrogation" test.[10] The majority does not claim in this case that the Union's proposal, concerning uniform items such as the undershirts and hats employees may wear at work, "abrogates" the pertinent management right, management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NTEU</span> (<span class="Italic">CBP</span>), 70 FLRA 100, 104 (2016) ("the proposal significantly burdens the Agency's right to determine internal-security practices and this burden outweighs any benefits that the proposal would afford to the officers"); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 66 FLRA 112, 117 (2011) ("After weighing the alleged benefits afforded to employees...against the burdens on management's rights to determine the methods and means of performing work, we find that the burdens on management's rights outweigh the benefits to employees."); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139</span>, 57 FLRA 292, 294-95 (2001) ("[T]he Union's proposal will benefit certain employees by preventing the Agency from changing the customer service policy to include language that could negatively impact employees' appraisals or subject them to disciplinary action. However, the Union's proposal will also severely restrict the Agency's ability to direct employees and assign work. In fact, the Union's proposal completely precludes the Agency from using the language that it wishes to use in the customer service policy, including the use of the word courteous. We conclude that this complete preclusion outweighs the benefits to employees of using the Union's offered language.... Therefore, the proposal is not within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R7-23</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 759 (1986) ("Proposals which totally abrogate the exercise of a management right excessively interfere with that right and do not constitute 'appropriate arrangements.'").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More fundamentally, the majority's new "negates" test negates core collective-bargaining principles. As the Authority's case law reflects, the collective-bargaining process exists to enable the parties to discuss and reconcile their <span class="Italic">different</span>, often mutually exclusive views as to how conditions-of-employment/working-conditions issues should be resolved.[11] This is the "bargaining" part of collective bargaining. And as then-Judge Scalia explained in the D.C. Circuit's decision that gave rise to the excessive-interference balancing test, appropriate-arrangements bargaining "can contravene what would in other circumstances be management prerogatives."[12] By giving controlling effect to "management's substantive decision"; that is, management's position on any matter in negotiations, the majority's new <span class="Italic">per se</span> "negates" test eliminates "bargaining" from the collective bargaining process. This is irrational, and fundamentally at odds with the Statute's basic purposes. Accordingly, on this issue I dissent.[13]</p>

Dist. 1, Local 1998</span>, 69 FLRA 626, 629 (2016) (the Authority found a proposal allowing passport specialists to avoid certain adjudication procedures for minors negotiable as an appropriate arrangement despite the agency's different position that "the proposal would prevent the Agency from assigning specialists 'to perform certain types of SSA-related checks when adjudicating minors' passport applications'"); <span class="Italic">NFFE, IAMAW, Fed.

<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;The majority's additional suggestion, that the Union's proposal is not an appropriate arrangement because it "would clearly violate the Agency's prerogative under the Statute to elect not to bargain at all over the substance of this &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matter," is also without merit. As the majority acknowledges earlier in its decision, "[a] proposal that interferes with management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) may nevertheless be a mandatory subject of negotiation if the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute."

<p class="noindent">Returning to <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, as a practical matter FLRA must depend on the parties' petition, position statement, and response to ascertain the benefit and burden presented by a proposal. The parties should be careful to fully and factually explain the predicates for their positions. Should the union create a proposal requiring management to act in a particular way under certain conditions, the union should identify the specific benefits created by the particular arrangement sought. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1709 and Dept. of Air Force, Dover AFB</span>, 56 FLRA 549, 553 (2000) (FLRA declines to consider a proposal as arrangement because union failed, under 5 CFR 2424.25I(1)(iii), to state basis for claimed status of proposal as arrangement); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 178 (1993) (Proposal 9: "As the Union has not identified the specific benefits to employees afforded by requiring the Agency to assign the specified functions only to the identified management officials, and as such benefits are not otherwise apparent to us, we find that the burden imposed on management's right to assign work outweighs whatever benefits the proposal might provide to unit employees."). It is also significant that FLRA will look, if it is pointed out to FLRA, to the past experience of the parties with the practice or proposal at issue, assuming there is past experience to address. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island</span>, 41 FLRA 589, 596 (1991) (discussion of several proposals included comments on past experience of parties with practices or contract provisions).</p>
