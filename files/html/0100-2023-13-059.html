<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-60"><span class="space">f.</span> Withdrawal of Request to Retire</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The reasons that justify an agency's refusal to withdraw a resignation or a retirement are generally the same, and the agency has the burden of proving the validity of the reasons by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Einstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 404, 407-08 (1985). If the agency, after accepting a retirement request and before acting upon it, refuses to allow it to be withdrawn, the retirement will be considered involuntary if the agency presents no evidence that the appellant's position was abolished or that a commitment was made to hire a replacement. The agency has the burden of proving the reasons for not permitting a request to be withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Almon v. NASA</span>, 16 MSPR 124 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Almon</span> the agency argued that withdrawal of retirements that was requested under an early retirement program would impair its efforts to stave off a RIF. The agency, however, had accepted 69 more retirements than it needed to avoid the RIF. During the ten weeks following the four appellants' attempted withdrawal of their retirements, the agency hired 69 new employees. Of the agency's defense, the Board commented that "the agency's decision to undertake an intensive hiring program after refusing appellants' retirement withdrawals seriously weakened the agency argument of administrative disruption." [Refer to decisions on early retirements involving voluntary separation incentive payments later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-060.html#sec6-61">Irrevocable Retirement; VSIP</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 48 MSPR 161, 163-66 (1991), analyzed the agency's obligation to permit withdrawal of a disability retirement application even after OPM accepted the application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]n August 21, 1986, OPM issued a notice approving the appellant's disability retirement application. Thereafter, the appellant and his supervisor agreed that the appellant's effective retirement date would be September 22, 1986, after the appellant had used up his accumulated sick leave. On August 28, 1986, however, the appellant informed his supervisor and OPM that he was withdrawing his application for disability retirement. Upon receiving this notification, the appellant's supervisor rescinded his approval of the appellant's sick leave and changed the effective date of the appellant's retirement to August 29, 1986.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has held that a disability retirement application may not be withdrawn once it has been granted and the employee is separated<span class="Italic">. Collier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 MSPR 38, 41 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1918 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The agency's argument, however, begs the question of whether it properly separated the appellant. If it did not, [FPM] S10-9(e)(5)'s prohibition against withdrawing an application after OPM has allowed the claim and the employee has been separated does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...S10-9(e)(1) states that OPM will honor, without question, the employee's request to withdraw his application. Indeed, this is what OPM did. Only after it discovered that the appellant had been separated by the agency did it refuse to allow the withdrawal. The agency asserts that it was required to separate the appellant because his application for disability retirement had been granted and therefore he was unable to work. As discussed above, however, the appellant would have been allowed by OPM to withdraw this application if he had not been separated by the agency. Consequently, OPM's decision to grant the appellant disability retirement did not necessarily require the agency to separate him. Moreover, if the appellant could not perform the duties of his position, the agency could have instituted action to remove him on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision governing the separation date for an employee approved for disability retirement, FPM Letter 831-78, Attachment 1, S10-10c(2), does not mandate that the employee either be placed on sick leave or separated immediately. Rather, it simply states that separation "usually" should occur not later than the end of the pay period in which the notice of approval is received. Therefore, the provision did not force the agency to separate the appellant immediately without regard to his individual circumstances, even if the grant of sick leave were no longer appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the administrative judge properly applied general Board law governing withdrawals of resignations and retirement applications in analyzing whether the agency constructively removed the appellant. The regulation governing voluntary separations from employment states that an agency may decline a request from an employee to withdraw a resignation before its effective date only when the agency has a valid reason and explains that reason to the employee. 5 CFR 715.202(b). The Board has interpreted this provision to apply to withdrawals of retirement applications as well as resignations and has found that an agency must support its decision to refuse to allow a withdrawal by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Einstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 404, 408 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2001"></span>The agency argues that the term "agency" in 5 CFR 715.202(b) should be interpreted to mean OPM since it was OPM's decision to disallow withdrawal. The fact remains, however, that the agency's decision to separate the appellant, not any action by OPM, prevented the appellant from withdrawing his application. The agency's decision to separate the appellant immediately based on OPM's decision to grant him disability retirement was tantamount to a refusal to accept his request to withdraw his disability retirement application. Therefore, the agency must support such refusal by a preponderance of the evidence. Because it did not, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency lacked a valid reason for refusing the appellant's request to withdraw his application and that it constructively removed him on August 29, 1986.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the agency separated the appellant from his position on the basis of his application for disability retirement, it did not afford him notice, explanation, or opportunity to respond to its action against him. Accordingly, in light of our decision in <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672 (1991)], we find that the appellant's removal must be reversed for denial of due process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may be required to resolve exactly when a retirement is effective, or "submitted," to determine whether an attempted retraction is effective. In <span class="Italic">Jostsons v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 74, 79-81 (1993), the agency offered an early-out retirement option requiring acceptance not later than October 3, 1992. The appellant mailed an application for immediate retirement to her personnel office on October 3, listing the effective date of the retirement as October 2. She sought to withdraw the application on Monday, October 5, before the envelope containing the application was opened. The Board declined to reverse the agency's decision not to permit withdrawal of the retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive issue in this appeal was the effective date of the appellant's retirement. If it was either October 2 or October 3, the agency was under no obligation either to allow withdrawal of the application or to explain its refusal to do so. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 433, 437 (1991) (once a resignation becomes effective, an agency has no obligation to allow withdrawal or to give any reason for refusing to do so). If the effective date was on or after October 5, as the appellant contends, then the agency could only deny the appellant's request if it had a valid reason for doing so, and the agency's refusal to allow withdrawal would constitute a constructive removal<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the administrative judge misinterpreted the Board's analysis in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> to hold that an employee's actions and words are binding, even when they have not been communicated to the agency. She contends that the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> in that Robinson "effectively communicated to his supervisor his intent to resign immediately," whereas her expressed intent to retire was not communicated to anyone until the envelope containing her retirement application was opened, by which time she had already withdrawn her application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that a decision to retire has no legal effect if it is not communicated to a responsible official. It is undisputed, however, that the appellant did communicate her decision to retire to a responsible official; she mailed a retirement application to her personnel office. The only issue is whether that application was effective upon mailing or upon receipt. Because the agency's announcement of the early-out option specified that "your completed retirement application must be <span class="Italic">submitted</span> to your personnel office no later than the close of business October 3, 1992," the issue thus becomes whether the application was "submitted" when it was deposited in the mail, or when it was delivered to the agency's personnel office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To "submit" means "to refer or present for the approval or decision of another or others: to submit a plan; (to submit an application)." <span class="Italic">Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</span> 1416 (1989). Under this definition, an application could reasonably be said to have been "submitted" either upon mailing or upon receipt. In the absence of evidence indicating that the parties intended the term to have one meaning rather than the other, we would be inclined to find that the appellant's retirement application was not "submitted" until the agency's personnel office received it. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hoke v. United States Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 362, 364 (1991) (finding that the appellant did not effectively withdraw her appeal to the Board when she mailed a letter of withdrawal to the Board's regional office, but telephoned the regional office before the letter was received to advise that she was rescinding her withdrawal). The record indicates, however, that the parties understood that the appellant's retirement application was "submitted" when it was mailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency provided a written statement by Kathy Longoria, personnel official, who described two telephone conversations she had with the appellant on October 2. During the first conversation, the appellant told Ms. Longoria that she would come in on Saturday, October 3, to submit her retirement paperwork, and Ms. Longoria told the appellant that she would check to ensure that someone would be available that day to receive the paperwork. Ms. Longoria contacted the appellant later that afternoon to advise her that the personnel office would not be staffed the entire day Saturday and that, if the appellant was not going to set a specific appointment time, she could mail in the paperwork. Ms. Longoria stated that she told the appellant that "a valid postmark of October 3, 1992 meant that the paperwork had been submitted on October 3, 1992 and this would be the same as submitting it in person Saturday."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Ms. Longoria's account of these conversations is unrebutted, it establishes that the parties understood that a retirement application mailed to the personnel office on October 3 would be submitted that date. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's retirement was effective no later than October 3, and that the agency was under no obligation to allow her to withdraw her application on October 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again on the timing of an attempted withdrawal of a retirement, under <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 142, 145 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once a retirement becomes effective, an agency has no obligation to allow its withdrawal or to give any reason for refusing to do so. Regardless of the official effective date of a retirement, however, the decision to retire has no legal effect until it is communicated to a responsible official; the Board has found that such communication has occurred when the agency's personnel office receives the retirement application. <span class="Italic">See Jostsons v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 74, 79-80 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 26 F.3d 139 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). According to the appellant, he signed retirement papers on November 20, 1992, that officially effected his retirement that day. He went to the agency's personnel department three days later, however, asking the officials there to allow him to withdraw his retirement, a request they refused. Given the appellant's statement that he went to the agency's personnel department to recover his retirement papers, it is apparent that the personnel department had already received them. The appellant's decision to retire thus had full legal effect, and the agency had no obligation to allow him to withdraw it or to explain its refusal to do so. The Board therefore lacks jurisdiction over that refusal. <span class="Italic">See Jostsons,</span> 58 MSPR at 75, 80-81.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The request to withdraw a retirement application need not be written, <span class="Italic">McCollum v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-11-0455-I-1 (NP 8/2/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant alleged that, on May 21, 2009--two days prior to the effective date of her separation--she informed Retha Fulmore, an agency personnel official, that she wished to revoke her disability retirement application, but that the agency effected her separation from service regardless. This constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency improperly refused to allow the appellant to withdraw her disability retirement application and that her disability retirement was therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Greene</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 161, 165-66 (the appellant's disability retirement was involuntary because she attempted to withdraw her disability retirement application prior to the effective date of her separation and the agency unjustifiably refused to allow the withdrawal). Contrary to the agency's suggestion on review, there is no legal requirement that a request to withdraw be in writing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue raised but not decided was how informal a request to withdraw a retirement may be and still require the agency to act on the request, <span class="Italic">Douglas v. DOD</span>, 108 MSPR 244, 248-49 &#x00B6; 9, 2008 MSPB 48 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has consistently held that, when an employee withdraws a commitment to retire prior to its effective date, even if previously agreed to through a valid VSIP agreement, the burden is on the agency to demonstrate a valid reason for refusing to permit the withdrawal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Perrine,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 715.202(b). Absent such a valid reason, the employee's separation is deemed involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Perrine,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12; <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 275. On remand, the parties should address this issue as well, and the AJ should determine whether the appellant's meeting with Captain Guthner and her immediate subsequent appeal to Senator Warner prior to the effective date of her retirement were attempts by the appellant to withdraw her commitment to retire, and, if so, whether the agency had a valid reason for refusing to permit the withdrawal. <span class="Italic">See Cook,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 273-75.</p>
