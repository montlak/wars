<p class="Body-Text">Summarized by <span class="Italic">Gagliardo v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, DC-0752-15-0117-I-1 (NP 1/13/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential requirements of constitutional due process for a tenured public employee are notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for him to present his account of events. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 11 (2016)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Drew v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 672 F.2d 197, 205-06 (D.C. Cir. 1982), Judge Mikva commented in a dissenting opinion on the effect of the Reform Act on notice requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA was intended to streamline employee dismissal procedures within the federal government. For example, the notice requirement of 7513(b)(1) requires only a statement of "the specific reasons for the proposed action," whereas its statutory predecessor required a statement of "any and all reasons, specifically and in detail," for a proposed removal.... In making the change, Congress intended to diminish the likelihood that dismissals would be reversed for procedural deficiencies, especially the failure to enumerate all instances of unsatisfactory employee conduct. Congress did not, however intend to deprive the employee of a full and fair opportunity to reply to the charges against him:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The change is intended to reduce the degree of detail now sometimes required in order to avoid reversal on procedural grounds. The agency must still tell the employee the make an informed reply. <span class="Italic">Senate Report</span>, at 50.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ensley v. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211208128">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency's notice of proposed removal is sufficient if "it apprises the employee of the nature of the charges 'in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply.'" <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (quoting <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). Here, PSNS satisfied that requirement. Specifically, PSNS's proposed removal letter explained that Ensley was charged with Inappropriate Conduct. It then described each element of that conduct in detail, citing dates, actions, and specific statements (as shown above). And, as the record shows, Ensley had no trouble understanding the charge or defending himself. Indeed, in his response to the letter, he addressed several of the allegations in detail....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Braun v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201221123">983 F.3d 1295</a>, 1304 (Fed.

The right to due process may be violated if, as to any basis for the ultimate removal decision, the notice of proposed removal did not 'fully inform the employee of the grounds' so as to provide 'an opportunity to make an informed response before the agency' on that basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1094. As to any basis ultimately relied on, a notice of removal must set forth the 'nature of the charges "in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply."' <span class="Italic">Brook v.

In its charges the agency is only required to set forth with sufficient specificity the events relied on to remove the appellant. Recitation of a regulatory violation in the caption to a charge, followed by recitation of facts alleging a conflict, is adequate notice of misconduct to an employee whose hearing established the facts supporting the charge. <span class="Italic">Dickinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 372, 374 (1987). The proposal need not specifically allege nexus between an offense and the enhancement of service efficiency through adverse action; the nexus may be inferred from the specific factual allegations or charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 527 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Nonetheless, a charge in an adverse action case should be specific.

Ordinarily, the charges are interpreted, <span class="Italic">seriatim</span>, by the AJ and then by the Board, and, on occasion, by the Federal Circuit. The parties argue the meaning of the charges, as they are reflected by the proposal and decision notices, at one level or another of the adjudication chain. Arguments should be made early in the process, to preserve the argument on appeal, and if an AJ characterizes a charge in a prehearing order, objection should immediately be made to the order to preserve for appeal an argument later to be presented in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has determined that this analysis applies not only to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing information that was previously unknown to the deciding official, but also to information personally known and considered by the deciding official, if that information was not included in the notice of proposed removal to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011). When a deciding official considers either type of information, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a potential constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Our reviewing court recently noted that "[w]here an employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information, procedural due process guarantees are not met because the employee is no longer on notice of the reasons for dismissal and/or of the evidence relied upon by the agency." <span class="Italic">Young v. Housing and Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2013). It has similarly recognized that the regulation governing adverse actions requires that an "agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official...." <span class="Italic">Norris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the agency improperly relied upon the report attached to the proposal notice to inform her of the nature of the charges, thereby depriving her of the opportunity to make an informed reply, and pursuant to the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Smith</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 520 (2011), the Board should reverse the demotion action on due process grounds. However, in this case, the proposal letter provided a detailed description of the charges and specifically notified the appellant that the incidents described in the attached investigatory report were the basis for the charge. By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the complaint issued by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) lacked the necessary particularity and supporting facts to satisfy due process. Rejecting OSC's claim that its investigatory interviews put the respondent on sufficient notice of the charges underlying the complaint, the Board found that the volume of documents that OSC provided the respondent during the investigatory process indicated that the interviews were not sufficiently focused to put the respondent on notice of the precise allegations against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 8. Thus, under the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the agency's notice of the charge and its proposed action satisfied due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that she discovered that certain incidents contained in the report were excluded from the charge; however, she has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that she failed to prove a <span class="Italic">Ward-Stone</span> violation.[9] The mere fact that the report included some incidents that the deciding official did not consider in sustaining the charge does not demonstrate that the deciding official considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in deciding to enhance the penalty. We further note that the appellant submitted a 200-page written response to the proposal notice in which she addressed all of the incidents alleged in the report, and that she had lengthy discussions with the proposing and deciding officials regarding the incidents underlying the charge.</p>

As discussed above, the appellant did receive due process regarding the charges underlying the suspension action as a whole. Moreover, to the extent the appellant may have had a due process right to notice of the basis for the reinstatement of the suspension, the agency provided the required notice by informing her that her performance on the detail was considered less than successful. <span class="Italic">See Lizzio v.

USDA,</span> SF-0752-10-0723-I-1 (NP 9/28/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his position based on a single charge and specification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Charge 1: Unacceptable Conduct</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Specification 1: Law Enforcement and Investigations (LEI) confirmed that, on July 9, 2008 at 9:14. <span class="small">A.M.</span>, you violated the use of the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS) Justice Data Interface Controller (JDIC) system by accessing the Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) records of another Forest Service employee without permission or authorization from LEI.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During his oral reply to this proposal notice, the appellant pointed out "several times" that the agency had not informed him of the identity of the employee whose records the appellant had allegedly improperly accessed. It is undisputed that the agency did not inform the appellant of the identity of the employee in question until after the appellant filed his Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence, that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense of retaliation for filing a previous Board appeal, and that the removal penalty did not exceed the bounds of reasonableness. In finding that the agency proved its charge, the administrative judge ruled that the agency was required to show that the appellant improperly accessed CLETS, but did not have to show that he accessed Employee X's DMV records. In assessing the reasonableness of the penalty, the administrative judge found that the deciding official had improperly considered two incidents of prior misconduct that were not included in the notice of proposed removal, but the judge "cured" this error by doing an independent analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that he was unable to properly prosecute his Board appeal because of the agency's failure to identify the employee whose records he allegedly improperly accessed until "shortly before the hearing. He also contends that the agency was required to prove that he actually accessed Employee X's DMV records on July 9, 2008, but that the agency failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, the appellant alleged that the agency's failure to identify--in the notice of proposed removal--the employee whose records he allegedly accessed improperly on July 9, 2008, constituted harmful procedural error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Harmful Error.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_3173"></span>a.&#x2003;The agency did not perform a proper fact-finding on the allegation that Mr. Rush did not have a requested authorization to check [Employee X's] DMV records. If they had provided Mr. Rush with [Employee X's] name, allowed him to respond to the charges with all facts at his disposal, and investigated [Employee X's] revoked license from the June 12, 2008, DMV check, they would undoubtedly have come to a different conclusion regarding the charge of unauthorized access of [Employee X's] records. But for these actions Mr. Rush would not have been charged or terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's failure to identify the employee whose records the appellant improperly accessed--in its notice of proposed removal--is most appropriately analyzed as a violation of due process under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution rather than as procedural error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) or as a matter affecting the fairness of the adjudication process. The requirements of due process for tenured public employees were set out by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). The Court described "'the root requirement' of the Due Process Clause as being 'that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing <span class="Italic">before</span> he is deprived of any significant property interest.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 542 (emphasis in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Connecticut</span>, 401 U.S. 371, 379 (1971)). The "pretermination 'hearing,' though necessary, need not be elaborate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 545. "It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 545-46. "The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, <span class="Italic">an explanation of the employer's evidence</span>, and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 546 (emphasis added). The Board has stated that the issue is "whether the notice of proposed removal, along with the supporting documentation attached thereto and contemporaneously provided to the appellant, afforded him sufficient notice of the charges against him to enable him to make a meaningful reply to the proposal." <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 8 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's notice of proposed removal did not afford the appellant sufficient notice of the charge against him to enable him to make a meaningful reply to the proposal. Although the notice listed a date and time when the appellant allegedly violated agency policy "by accessing the Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) records of another Forest Service employee without permission or authorization," it did not tell him <span class="Italic">whose</span> records he had allegedly accessed. Especially considering that the conduct with which the appellant was accused had occurred almost 2 years prior to the notice of proposed removal, he could not meaningfully respond to the charged behavior without knowing the identity of the employee whose DMV records he allegedly accessed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A due process violation may not be cured or corrected after an adverse action has been effected. As our reviewing court has recently reiterated, if an employee's right to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment has been violated, he is entitled to "an 'entirely new' and 'constitutionally correct' removal proceeding." <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Accordingly, the agency's removal action may not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the notice proposed removal, but the proposing official understood that he was only proposing a demotion and that official told the appellant that he was proposing his removal from a supervisory corrections officer position and that he would be demoted to an officer position, the ensuing removal was void for lack of due process when the deciding official, upon learning during the reply of the appellant's misunderstanding, did not stop the proceedings, clarify matters to the appellant, and allow him additional time to reply. The proposal did not state that the removal was from the federal service. It was immaterial that the appellant did not seek an extension; it was the agency's obligation to afford due process, not the appellant's to request it. <span class="Italic">Seeba v. DOJ</span>, PH-0752-17-0162-I-1 (NP 2/21/2023) (Member Leavitt dissenting); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-12-0084-I-1 (NP 4/1/2014) (complex set of facts, with the bottom line being that if an adjudicator, e.g., EEOC, orders the agency to cancel a proposal notice, as a matter of due process, the lack of charges and the opportunity to respond to those charges, the removal decision based on that notice cannot be sustained by the Board).</p>
