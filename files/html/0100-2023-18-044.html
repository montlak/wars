<h2 class="h2" id="sec10-45"><span class="space">V.</span> FAIR REPRESENTATION SUIT; RELATED JUDICIAL CLAIM</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Supreme Court precluded federal sector fair representation lawsuits as to individuals within the coverage of the FSLMRS in <span class="Italic">Karahalios v. NFFE Local 1263</span>, 489 U.S. 527, 531-37, 109 S. Ct. 1282 (1989):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to 1978, labor relations in the federal sector were governed by a 1962 Executive Order administered by a Federal Labor Relations Council whose decisions were not subject to judicial review. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 91-92, 104 S. Ct. 439, 441-442, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983). Since 1978, Title VII of the CSRA has been the controlling authority. Of particular relevance here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) provides that a labor organization that has been accorded the exclusive right of representing employees in a designated unit "is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership." This provision is "virtually identical" to that found in the Executive Order and is the source of the collective-bargaining agent's duty of fair representation. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1453</span>, 23 F.L.R.A. 686, 690 (1986). This duty also parallels the fair representation obligation of a union in the private sector that has been found implicit in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 151 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1982 ed. and Supp. IV), and the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 44 Stat. 577, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 45 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 151 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. <span class="Italic">See Vaca v. Sipes</span>, 386 U.S. 171, 180-183, 87 S. Ct. 903, 911-913, 17 L. Ed.2d 842 (1967); <span class="Italic">Steele v. Louisville &#x0026; Nashville R. Co</span>., 323 U.S. 192, 205-207, 65 S. Ct. 226, 233-234, 89 L. Ed. 173 (1944).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII also makes it clear that a breach of the duty of fair representation is an unfair labor practice, for it provides that it is "an unfair labor practice for a labor organization...to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter." &#x00A7; 7116(b)(8). Under &#x00A7; 7118, unfair labor practice complaints are adjudicated by the FLRA, which is authorized to order remedial action appropriate to carry out the purposes of Title VII, including an award of backpay against either the agency or the labor organization that has committed the unfair practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no express suggestion in Title VII that Congress intended to furnish a parallel remedy in a federal district court to enforce the duty of fair representation.&#x2003;The Title provides recourse to the courts in only three instances: with specified exceptions, persons aggrieved by a final FLRA order may seek review in the appropriate court of appeals, &#x00A7; 7123(a); the FLRA may seek judicial enforcement of its orders, &#x00A7; 7123(b); and temporary injunctive relief is available to the FLRA to assist it in the discharge of its duties, &#x00A7; 7123(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner nevertheless insists that a cause of action to enforce the Union's fair representation duty should be implied. Such a claim poses an issue of statutory construction: The "ultimate issue is whether Congress intended to create a private cause of action," <span class="Italic">California v. Sierra Club</span>, 451 U.S. 287, 293, 101 S. Ct. 1775, 1779, 68 L. Ed.2d 101 (1981) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Touche Ross &#x0026; Co. v.

<p class="noindent-1">These guideposts indicate that the Court of Appeals was quite correct in concluding that neither the language nor the structure of the Act shows any congressional intent to provide a private cause of action to enforce federal employees unions' duty of fair representation. That duty is expressly recognized in the Act, and an administrative remedy for its breach is expressly provided for before the FLRA, a body created by Congress to enforce the duties imposed on agencies and unions by Title VII, including the duty of fair representation. Nothing in the legislative history of Title VII has been called to our attention indicating that Congress contemplated direct judicial enforcement of the union's duty. Indeed, the General Counsel of the FLRA was to have exclusive and final authority to issue unfair labor practice complaints, and only those matters mentioned in &#x00A7; 7123 were to be judicially reviewable. H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, p. 52 (1978). All complaints of unfair labor practices were to be filed with the FLRA. S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 107 (1978). Furthermore, Title VII contemplates the arbitration of unsettled grievances, but a House proposal that the duty to arbitrate could be enforced in federal court in the first instance was ultimately rejected. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1717, p. 157 (1978) U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978 pp. 2723, 2829, 2860, 2891. There exists no equivalent to &#x00A7; 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 185, which permits judicial enforcement of private collective-bargaining contracts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, however, relies on another source to find the necessary congressional intent to provide him with a cause of action. Petitioner urges that Title VII was modeled after the NLRA and that the authority of the FLRA was meant to be similar to that of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). Because this Court found implicit in the NLRA a private cause of action against unions to enforce their fair representation duty even after the NLRB had construed the NLRA to make a breach of the duty an unfair labor practice, petitioner argues that Congress must <span id="page_2558"></span>have intended to preserve this judicial role under Title VII. Much of the argument rests on our decision in <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes, supra</span>. There are, however, several difficulties with this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first place, Title VII is not a carbon copy of the NLRA, nor is the authority of the FLRA the same as that of the NLRB. The NLRA, like the RLA, did not expressly make a breach of the duty of fair representation an unfair labor practice and did not expressly provide for the enforcement of such a duty by the NLRB. That duty was implied by the Court because members of bargaining units were forced to accept unions as their exclusive bargaining agents. Because employees had no administrative remedy for a breach of the duty, we recognized a judicial cause of action on behalf of the employee. This occurred both under the RLA, <span class="Italic">Steele v. Louisville &#x0026; Nashville R. Co., supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Trainmen v. Howard</span>, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S. Ct. 1022, 96 L. Ed. 1283 (1952), and also under the LMRA, <span class="Italic">Syres v. Oil Workers</span>, 350 U.S. 892, 76 S. Ct. 152, 100 L. Ed. 785 (1955); <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes, supra</span>. Very dissimilarly, Title VII of the CSRA not only expressly recognizes the fair representation duty but also provides for its administrative enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, prior to <span class="Italic">Vaca</span>, the NLRB had construed &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7 and 8(b) of the NLRA to impose a duty of fair representation on union bargaining age ts and to make its breach an unfair labor practice. <span class="Italic">See Miranda Fuel Co</span>., 140 N.L.R.B. 181 (1962), <span class="Italic">enf. denied</span>, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Miranda Fuel Co</span>., 326 F.2d 172 (CA2 1963). The issue in <span class="Italic">Vaca</span>, some years later, was whether, in light of <span class="Italic">Miranda Fuel Co</span>., the courts still had jurisdiction to enforce the unions' duty. As we understood our inquiry, it was whether Congress, in enacting &#x00A7; 8(b) in 1947, had intended to oust the courts of their role of enforcing the duty of fair representation implied under the NLRA. We held that the "tardy assumption" of jurisdiction by the NLRB was insufficient reason to abandon our prior cases, such as <span class="Italic">Syres</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, there can be no mistaking Congress' intent to create a duty previously without statutory basis, and no mistaking the authority of the FLRA to enforce that duty. Also, because the courts played no role in enforcing a union's fair representation duty under Executive Order No. 11491 &#x00A7; 10e, 3 CFR 861 (1966-1970 Comp.), and subsequent amended orders, under the pre-CSRA regulatory regime, there was not in this context any pre-existing judicial role that at least arguably Congress intended to preserve.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Vaca</span> and the earlier cases, it was stressed that by providing for exclusive bargaining agents, the pertinent statutes deprived bargaining unit employees of their individual rights to bargain for wages, hours, and working conditions. Hence it was critical that unions be required to represent all in good faith. Again, Title VII operates in a different context. As the United States as <span class="Italic">amicus</span> explains, federal employment does not rest on contract in the private sector sense; nor is it clear that the deprivation a federal employee suffers from the election of a bargaining agent--if there is such a deprivation--is comparable to the private sector predicament. Moreover, the collective-bargaining mechanisms created by Title VII do not deprive employees of recourse to any of the remedies otherwise provided by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See the CSRA</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(5) and 7121(e)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that <span class="Italic">Vaca</span> rested in part on the fact that private collective-bargaining contracts were enforceable in the federal courts under LMRA &#x00A7; 301. Because unfair representation claims most often involve a claim of breach by the employer and since employers are suable under &#x00A7; 301, the implied fair representation cause of action allows claims against an employer and a union to be adjudicated in one action. Section 301 has no equivalent under Title VII; there is no provision in that Title for suing an agency in federal court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We therefore discern no basis for finding congressional intent to provide petitioner with a cause of action against the Union.&#x2003;Congress undoubtedly was aware from our cases such as <span class="Italic">Cort v. Ash</span>, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 45 L. Ed.2d 26 (1975), that the Court had departed from its prior standard for resolving a claim urging that an implied statutory cause of action should be recognized, and that such issues were being resolved by a straightforward inquiry into whether Congress intended to provide a private cause of action. Had Congress intended the courts to enforce a federal employees union's duty of fair representation, we would expect to find some evidence of that intent in the statute or its legislative history. We find none. Just as in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 668, 672, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988), we held that the CSRA's "integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review" foreclosed an implied right to Court of Claims review, we follow a similar course here. <span class="Italic">See also Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 388, 103 S. Ct. 2404, 2416, 76 L. Ed.2d 648 (1983). To be sure, courts play a role in CSRA &#x00A7; 7116(b)(8) fair representation cases, but only sitting in review of the FLRA. To hold that the district courts must entertain such cases in the first instance would seriously undermine what we deem to be the congressional scheme, namely to leave the enforcement of union and agency duties under the Act to the General Counsel and the FLRA and to confine the courts to the role given them under the Act.</p>

<p class="noindent">A court concluded that the remedial scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act preempted a lawsuit based on state law claims by a manager against union officials who the manager believed were making unfounded complaints about his actions as a manager. <span class="Italic">Schwartz v.

Cir. 2009), the court determined that the CSRA precluded an Administrative Procedure Act claim by a group of air traffic controllers who had contract grievance procedures, or a possible lawsuit (as opposed to an FLRA case), against a union for a violation of any duty of fair representation breach resulting from treatment of a contract grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have long held that federal employees may not use the Administrative Procedure Act to challenge agency employment actions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Fornaro v. James</span>, 416 F.3d 63, 66-67 (D.C. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft</span>, 358 F.3d 931, 933-35 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171, 172 (D.C. Cir. 1983). This is so because Congress, through the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), and related employment statutes, has carefully constructed a system for review and resolution of federal employment disputes, intentionally providing--and intentionally not providing--particular forums and procedures for particular kinds of claims. As such, we have held that this comprehensive employment scheme preempts judicial review under the more general APA even when that scheme provides no judicial relief--that is, "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." <span class="Italic">Fornaro</span>, 416 F.3d at 67. In this case four air traffic controllers nonetheless argue that they may use the APA to litigate their pay dispute with the Federal Aviation Administration because the CSRA provides them no protection. Straightforwardly applying our precedent, we affirm the district court's dismissal of their suit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly for our purposes, the FAA is largely exempted from the CSRA by 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1), which directs the FAA to develop "a personnel management system for the Administration that addresses the unique demands on the agency's workforce," "notwithstanding the provisions of title 5 [i.e., the CSRA] and other Federal personnel laws." <span class="Italic">See also </span>&#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) ("The provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system...."). Congress required that "[s]uch a new system shall, at a minimum, provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel." &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1). In response the FAA created a personnel management system with dispute resolution provisions that largely track those of the CSRA, providing greater review for major adverse actions and no review for minor actions like this pay-scale dispute. The general exemption from the CSRA has certain exceptions, however, as CSRA provisions such as "chapter 71, relating to labor-management relations," continue to apply. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the provisions in that chapter that still apply is section 7121(a)(1), which requires that collective bargaining agreements contain negotiated procedures for the settlement of grievances, and which the controllers cite as the statutory basis for Count I of their amended complaint. This section previously provided that such negotiated grievance procedures would be "the exclusive procedures for resolving <span id="page_2559"></span>grievances which fall within its coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (1994). In 1994, however, Congress amended section 7121(a)(1) to make negotiated grievance procedures "the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative </span>procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (emphasis added). Having held that the earlier version of this section precluded all judicial review for employees with negotiated grievance procedures, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1454 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), the Federal Circuit recently reversed course, holding that the 1994 amendment signaled Congress's intent no longer to preclude all review of covered grievances. <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1220, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Seeking reversal of the district court's ruling that they have no cause of action, the controllers make three arguments: (1) that the district court erred in dismissing the bargaining unit members because section 7121(a)(1), as amended, no longer precludes judicial review of negotiated grievance procedures; (2) that by revisiting dismissal of the APA claims, the district court violated the law of the case; and (3) that because their employer is largely exempt from the CSRA, the controllers can maintain an APA cause of action notwithstanding our CSRA preclusion precedents. We consider each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The controllers' first argument--applicable only to the bargaining unit members--lacks in relevance whatever it might have in merit. It may be true that in amending section 7121(a)(1) Congress intended no longer to preclude all judicial review for employees with negotiated grievance procedures; it may also be true that <span class="Italic">Mudge </span>correctly allowed the employees in that case to proceed; it may even be true that the district court's first opinion in this case erroneously used section 7121(a)(1) as justification for dismissing all bargaining-unit employee claims. But even if section 7121(a)(1) no longer has this preclusive effect, it is emphatically untrue that "&#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) <span class="Italic">establishes </span>[a] federal employee's right to seek judicial remedy for [a] grievance subject to negotiated procedures in [a] collective bargaining agreement," as the controllers maintain in their complaint, Am. Compl. &#x00B6; 37 (emphasis added). To the contrary, as the Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Whitman v. Department of Transportation</span>, 547 U.S. 512, 513 (2006), section "7121(a)(1) does not confer jurisdiction," nor does it create a cause of action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because section 7121(a)(1), by itself, provides no right to sue, the bargaining unit employees must point to an independent source of law in order to maintain this action. In <span class="Italic">Mudge </span>a money claim within the Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims provided the cause of action, <span class="Italic">see </span>28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 50 Fed. Cl. 500, 502 (Fed. Cl. 2001); in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, the case that <span class="Italic">Mudge </span>held overruled by the 1994 amendment, the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b), provided the cause of action, <span class="Italic">see </span>909 F.2d at 1453. Neither is available here. In fact, the only basis for a cause of action the bargaining unit controllers even mention in their complaint is the APA--the same source identified by the non-bargaining unit controllers. Thus, the case for all four controllers begins and ends with the question identified as central by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Whitman </span>and answered in the district court's second opinion--namely "whether &#x00A7; 7121 (<span class="Italic">or the CSRA as a whole</span>) removes the jurisdiction given to the federal courts or otherwise precludes employees from pursuing" a claim under the APA, <span class="Italic">Whitman</span>, 547 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added, citation omitted). If we answer that question in the affirmative then neither the bargaining unit members nor the supervisors have a claim, whether or not the district court, in its first opinion, properly relied on section 7121(a)(1) to dismiss all bargaining unit employee claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reviewing <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the dismissal of the APA claims, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Munsell v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 509 F.3d 572, 578 (D.C. Cir. 2007), we find no error in the district court's decision. Twenty-five years ago, in <span class="Italic">Carducci v. Regan</span>, we held that "the exhaustive remedial scheme of the CSRA would be impermissibly frustrated by permitting, for lesser personnel actions not involving constitutional claims, an access to the courts more immediate and direct than the statute provides with regard to major adverse actions." 714 F.2d at 174. Holding that "failure to include some types of [claims] within the remedial scheme of so comprehensive a piece of legislation reflects a congressional intent that no judicial relief be available," we found an APA remedy beyond that provided in the CSRA precluded by the comprehensiveness of the CSRA itself. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 174-75. The Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion five years later in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, holding that the exclusion of particular employees (rather than particular claims) from the CSRA was not an invitation to those employees to sue under other statutes but a "manifestation of a considered congressional judgment that they should not have statutory entitlement to review." 484 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We clarified the breadth of these precedents in two recent cases.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Graham v. Ashcroft</span>, we held that the lack of any entitlement to judicial review in the CSRA precluded litigation of an employment matter under the APA even where the complaint did not concern "'a <span class="Italic">type </span>of personnel action covered by the CSRA.'" 358 F.3d 931, 934 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 448 (emphasis added, brackets omitted)). Thus, we found preclusion not because 9 the CSRA identified some other kind of plaintiff or some other kind of procedure for bringing the claim, but because it provided no way of bringing it. As to such claims we said, "the CSRA provides no relief and precludes other avenues of relief." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 935. One year later in <span class="Italic">Fornaro w</span>e made the point even more directly, holding that "what you get under the CSRA is what you get." 416 F.3d at 67. Not one of our precedents has cited section 7121(a)(1) in so holding, and the controllers nowhere argue that the 1994 amendment affects these cases or their now-familiar analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, the controllers correctly point out that Congress largely exempted the FAA from the CSRA, and that we have never before had occasion to apply our preclusion cases to employees of an exempt agency. But the upshot of our precedents for this case is absolutely clear. Far from saving an APA claim, Congress's exemption of these controllers' agency from the CSRA signals the same thing as Congress's omission of the type of personnel action at issue in <span class="Italic">Graham </span>or the type of employees at issue in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>--namely that Congress intended to provide these employees with no judicial review. This is because we treat the CSRA and Congress's related employment statutes as covering the field of federal employee claims, and so our cases expressly teach that those left out of this scheme are left out on purpose. Indeed this case is easier than most, for we need make no inferences about the pregnant meaning of legislative silence. In exempting the FAA from the CSRA, Congress made its intent perfectly clear: to "provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location of personnel." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(1). Because giving FAA employees a unique right of access to the courts would frustrate rather than further that intent, proper application of our precedents bars this suit. <span class="Italic">See also McAuliffe v. Rice</span>, 966 F.2d 979, 980-81 (5th Cir. 1992) (reaching same conclusion as to different entity exempted from CSRA because allowing APA review would "thwart[&#8197;] the goal of maintaining flexibility").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The controllers argue that "[w]hatever the scope of the 'flexibility' which Congress granted to the FAA, it is inconceivable that Congress authorized the FAA to devise a compensation plan for its Controllers and then violate that plan with impunity and without review." The controllers never develop this apparent due process argument, nor could they, for even its factual premise is flawed. The controllers do have a remedy: if the FAA fails to live up to its agreements, the union can pursue the matter (union grievance regarding Albuquerque Center salary level), and if the union fails to live up to its duty of representation, the controllers can pursue the union, <span class="Italic">see Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 966 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("A failure to seek arbitration (which an employee may not compel on his own) may constitute such a breach of the union's duty [of fair representation]. But, in that event, only the FLRA--not a district court--may remedy the breach by ordering arbitration."). These procedures surely lack the directness and immediacy of an APA suit, and the controllers have apparently found them frustrating (accusing NACTA of "machinations" designed to defeat Filebark's claims). But the choice of procedures lies with Congress, and as we have repeatedly held, Congress had no intention of providing claimants like these--unmentioned in the CSRA--with a level of access to the courts unavailable to almost any other federal employees, including those that the CSRA identifies as most worthy of procedural protection. <span class="Italic">See Graham</span>, 358 F.3d at 935 (citing <span class="Italic">Fausto </span>and <span class="Italic">Carducci </span>for the proposition that giving direct APA review to claimants not entitled to review procedures under the CSRA would upset careful congressional layering of remedial procedures). Thus, we find this APA claim precluded by the structure of Congress's employment statutes and "the CSRA as a whole," <span class="Italic">Whitman</span>, 547 U.S. at 514.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the controllers identify only the APA as the statutory basis for their claims, and because such claims are precluded by the CSRA as a whole regardless of who brings them, we affirm. <span class="Italic">So ordered.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding the unavailability of fair representation suits for damages, the D.C. Circuit suggested that the federal courts were available for injunctive relief on constitutional issues as long as administrative remedies were first exhausted as to claims presenting a mixture of labor law and constitutional issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1990).

<p class="noindent-1">As a federal employee who was also a member of a union, Ms. Paige was entitled, upon request, to have a union representative present at any investigation that she believed could have resulted in disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)(i), (ii). Assuming without deciding that the <span id="page_2560"></span>meetings were in fact investigations that could have led to disciplinary action, HUD's alleged refusal to allow her to have a representative present would have been an unfair labor practice, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(8), which Ms. Paige was required to raise in the first instance with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Karahalios v. Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps</span>., 489 U.S. 527, 532 (1989) ("[U]nfair labor practice complaints are adjudicated by the FLRA, which is authorized to order remedial action appropriate to carry out the purposes of the [Civil Service Reform Act], including an award of backpay against either the agency or the labor organization that has committed the unfair practice....&#8197;There is no express suggestion in [the Act] that Congress intended to furnish a parallel remedy in a federal district court to enforce [an employee's rights under the Act]."). Because there is no record of such an FLRA claim, dismissal of this claim is mandated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal Ms.&#x2003;Paige argues that her unfair-labor-practices claim arises under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 or under the union's collective-bargaining agreement with HUD. There is a reference to &#x00A7; 7513 in Ms. Paige's amended complaint, but that statute is irrelevant because the employee rights described in &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1)-(4), including the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative, are provided only for the actions described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)-(5), none of which was taken in this case. And setting aside that Ms. Paige has not cited any authority that would allow her to sue in federal district court for the alleged violation of a collective-bargaining agreement, she never argued such a violation in the district court, and her failure to argue for plain error on appeal means the argument is foreclosed. <span class="Italic">See Richison</span>, 634 F.3d at 1131.</p>
<p class="noindent">Defamation claims may be pursued against unions. They are not preempted by the remedial structure of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Wood v. AFGE,</span> <a href="https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/190/">255 F. Supp.3d 190</a> (D.D.C. 2017) (citing <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. Flores,</span> 543 F.3d 248 (5th Cir. 2008)). Tort claims may also be pursued against unions without running afoul of CSRA preemption. <span class="Italic">See Conejo v. AFGE,</span> <a href="https://casetext.com/case/conejo-v-am-fedn-of-govt-emps">377 F. Supp.3d 16</a> (D.D.C. 2019).</p>
