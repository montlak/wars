<h2 class="h2" id="sec6-126"><span class="space">II.</span> SERVICE EFFICIENCY</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">Adjudication of an employee's appeal from an adverse action requires at least two determinations by the trier of fact: first, whether the conduct occurred; second, whether the action taken by the agency--the penalty--promotes service efficiency. <span class="Italic">Danese v. IRS</span>, 11 MSPR 97, 99 (1982). An agency may take an action against an employee under 5 USC Chapter 75 only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. The governing statute, 5 USC 7513(a), provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an agency may take an action covered by this subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The implementing regulation of OPM is 5 CFR 752.403 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Standard for action</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may take an adverse action, including a performance-based adverse action or an indefinite suspension, under this subpart only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An agency may not take an adverse action against an employee on the basis of any reason prohibited by 5 U.S.C. 2302.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regulatory changes in 2020 at 5 CFR 752.403 (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-24-011.html#sec17-10">Chapter 7</a>) limited mitigation authority and settlement authority (discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>). Those limitations were dropped by regulatory amendments by OPM in 2022. See 87 Fed. Reg. 67765 (Nov. 10, 2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM proposed regulations, 73 Fed. Reg. 54075 (Sept. 18, 2008), to add to &#x00A7; 752.403(a) an indefinite suspension. The proposed regulation further described the scope of an indefinite suspension. The final regulation notice determined not to add a further description of the indefinite suspension, leaving that task for the "further delineation of the law by the MSPB and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit before deciding whether to propose substantive regulations on this subject." 74 Fed. Reg. 63531, 63532 (Dec. 4, 2009). There has been a law of intervening law, but no intervening OPM regulation specifically addressing indefinite suspensions other than the generic definition at 5 CFR 752.402 (2022). [Refer to discussion in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-203.html#sec1-201">Indefinite Suspension.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The historical derivation of the statutory protection was described in <span class="Italic">Fowler v. United States</span>, 633 F.2d 1258, 1259-60 (8th Cir. 1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Historically, the government, like other employers, enjoyed a virtually unfettered discretion in regulating the employment relationship. "For almost the first century of our national existence, federal employment was regarded as an item of patronage, which could be granted, withheld, or withdrawn for whatever reasons might appeal to the responsible executive hiring officer." <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy,</span> 416 U.S. 134, 148, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 1641, 40 L. Ed.2d 15 (1974); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Cafeteria &#x0026; Restaurant Workers Local 743 v. McElroy,</span> 367 U.S. 886, 896, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 1749, 6 L. Ed.2d 1230 (1961).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eventually, in response to growing public demand for civil service reform, Congress passed the Pendleton Act in 1883 and, finally, the Lloyd-LaFollette Act in 1912. The Pendleton Act provided for the creation of a classified civil service and laid the foundation for modern notions of competitive government service by requiring the examination of applicants for entry into classified positions. The Lloyd-LaFollette Act, as now codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513, extends to employees in competitive service both substantive and procedural guarantees. Subdivision (a) of that section provides that a person employed in a competitive service position can be removed from his job "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fleming v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 302, 307 n.10 (1986), commented on the evolution of the "efficiency of the service" standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourteen years after passage of the Pendleton Act, which established a Civil Service Commission charged with promulgating Federal civil service rules and establishing competitive examinations, President McKinley ordered that "no removal shall be made from any position subject to comprehensive examination except for just cause and upon written charges." Exec. Order No. 101 (1897), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 18 U.S. Civil Service Commission Ann. Rep. 282 (1902). Subsequent orders defined "just causes" as those that would promote the "efficiency of the service," <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Exec. Order No. 173 (1902), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 19 U.S. Civil Service Commission Ann. Rep. 76 (1902) (defining "just cause" as "any cause, other than one merely political or religious, which will promote the efficiency of the service"). This standard was incorporated in the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912. Act of Aug. 24, 1912, Ch. 389, &#x00A7; 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555; Act of Oct. 13, 1978, P.L. 95-454, &#x00A7; 204(a), 92 Stat. 1136 (codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/YEE_CORINNE_S_SF_0752_13_3562_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1101026.pdf">121 MSPR 686</a>, 693-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, 2014 MSPB 81 (2014), described the service efficiency standard in a furlough appeal and a claim that the furlough was not necessitated by funding restraints of the Navy, as compared to its parent, the Defense Department:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has long held that, in order to promote the efficiency of the service, there must be a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for an adverse action and either the employee's <span id="Page_2183"></span>ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate governmental interest promoting the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Hoofman v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 16 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 526 F. App'x 982 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Risner v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 480, 485-86 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 677 F.2d 36 (8th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">see Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 272 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Here, that "other legitimate governmental interest," which bears a clear and direct relationship to the appellant's furlough, consists of the serious budgetary challenges facing DOD as a whole, which the appellant does not dispute on review. In this regard, we note that, although the Navy is separately organized under the Secretary of the Navy, it operates under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5011. In particular, the Secretary of the Navy is responsible to the Secretary of Defense for, among other things, "the effective and timely implementation of policy, program, and budget decisions and instructions of the President or the Secretary of Defense relating to the functions" of the Navy. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5013(c)(3). Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that, although the appellants asserted that the Navy had adequate funding to avoid the furloughs, it was reasonable for DOD to consider its budget situation holistically, rather than isolating each individual military department's situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the substantive ground for taking an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 has been essentially unchanged in the civil service law since 1912 with the enactment of the landmark Lloyd-LaFollette Act. <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 830 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912 provided that "no person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of said service and for reasons given in writing." Lloyd-LaFollette Act of 1912, ch. 389, &#x00A7; 6, 37 Stat. 539, 555; <span class="Italic">see Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 383 (1983). Thus, under this provision, an agency needed to show that its action promoted the efficiency of the "civil service" of the United States. With the passage of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, furlough actions were, for the first time, subject to the same procedural requirements as removals and other adverse actions, at least as to actions against preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">Hastie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 64, 68 (1984), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571, 574-77 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Section 14 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 provided that no permanent or indefinite preference eligible who has completed a probationary or trial period "employed in the civil service," or in any establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, or department created by Acts of Congress or Presidential Executive Order, shall be discharged, suspended for more than 30 days, furloughed without pay, reduced in rank or compensation, or debarred for future appointment "except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing." Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387, 388, 390. Similar to the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, the reference to the "efficiency of the service" in the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 is preceded by a reference to the "civil service," suggesting that an agency could meet its burden by showing that its action promoted the efficiency of the "civil service" of the United States. The appellant has not alleged, and there is no indication, that Congress intended any change in meaning in the current version of the law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 158-64, 94 S. Ct. 1633 (1974), found constitutional the "efficiency of the service" standard under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, predecessor to the Reform Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellee also contends that the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(a), authorizing removal or suspension without pay "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," are vague and overbroad. The District Court accepted this contention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"Because employees faced with the standard of 'such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service' can only guess as to what utterances may cost them their jobs, there can be little question that they will be deterred from exercising their First Amendment rights to the fullest extent." 349 F. Supp., at 866.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A certain anomaly attends appellee's substantive constitutional attack on the Lloyd-La Follette Act just as it does his attack on its procedural provisions. Prior to the enactment of this language in 1912, there was no such statutory inhibition on the authority of the Government to discharge a federal employee, and an employee could be discharged with or without cause for conduct which was not protected under the First Amendment. Yet under the District Court's holding, a federal employee after the enactment of the Lloyd-La Follette Act may not even be discharged for conduct which constitutes "cause" for discharge and which is not protected by the First Amendment, because the guarantee of job security which Congress chose to accord employees is "vague" and "overbroad."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold the standard of "cause" set forth in the Lloyd-La Follette Act as a limitation on the Government's authority to discharge federal employees is constitutionally sufficient against the charges both of overbreadth and of vagueness. In <span class="Italic">Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> 413 U.S. 548, 578--579, 93 S. Ct. 2880, 2897, 37 L. Ed.2d 796 (1973), we said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[T]here are limitations in the English language with respect to being both specific and manageably brief, and it seems to us that although the prohibitions may not satisfy those intent on finding fault at any cost, they are set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest. '[T]he general class of offense to which...[the provisions are] directed is plainly within [their] terms..., [and they] will not be struck down as vague, even though marginal cases could be put where doubts might arise.' <span class="Italic">United States v. Hariss,</span> 347 U.S. 612, 618 (74 S. Ct. 808, 812, 98 L. Ed. 989) (1954)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress sought to lay down an admittedly general standard, not for the purpose of defining criminal conduct, but in order to give myriad different federal employees performing widely disparate tasks a common standard of job protection. We do not believe that Congress was confined to the choice of enacting a detailed code of employee conduct, or else granting no job protection at all. As we said in <span class="Italic">Colten v. Kentucky,</span> 407 U.S. 104, 92 S. Ct. 1953, 32 L. Ed.2d 584 (1972):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"The root of the vagueness doctrine is a rough idea of fairness. It is not a principle designed to convert into a constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 110, 92 S. Ct., at 1957.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the language "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" was not written upon a clean slate in 1912, and it does not appear on a clean slate now. The Civil Service Commission has indicated that what might be said to be longstanding principles of employer-employee relationships, like those developed in the private sector, should be followed in interpreting the language used by Congress. Moreover, the OEO has provided by regulation that its Office of General Counsel is available to counsel employees who seek advice on the interpretation of the Act and its regulations. We found the similar procedure offered by the Civil Service Commission important in rejecting the respondents' vagueness contentions in <span class="Italic">Civil Service Commission v. National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> 413 U.S., at 580, 93 S. Ct., at 2897.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" as a standard of employee job protection is without doubt intended to authorize dismissal for speech as well as other conduct. <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education,</span> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 1734, 20 L. Ed.2d 811 (1968), makes it clear that in certain situations the discharge of a Government employee may be based on his speech without offending guarantees of the First Amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"At the same time it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the infinite variety of factual situations in which public statements by Government employees might reasonably justify dismissal for "cause," we conclude that the Act describes, as explicitly as is required, the employee conduct which is ground for removal. The essential fairness of this broad and general removal standard, and the impracticability of greater specificity, were recognized by Judge Leventhal, writing for a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Meehan v. Macy,</span> 129 U.S. App. D.C. 217, 230, 392 F.2d 822, 835 (1968), <span class="Italic">modified,</span> 138 U.S. App. D.C. 38, 425 F.2d 469, <span class="Italic">aff'd en banc,</span> 138 U.S. App. D.C. 41, 425 F.2d 472 (1969):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"[I]t is not feasible or necessary for the Government to spell out in detail all that conduct which will result in retaliation. The most conscientious of codes that define prohibited conduct of employees includes 'catch-all' clauses prohibiting employee 'misconduct,' 'immorality,' or 'conduct unbecoming.' We think it is inherent in the employment relationship as a matter of common sense if not (of) common law that [a Government] employee...cannot reasonably assert a right to keep his job while at the same time he inveighs against his superiors in public with intemperate and defamatory [cartoons] .... [Dismissal in such circumstances neither] comes as an unfair surprise [nor] is so unexpected...as to chill...freedom to engage in appropriate speech."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Congress when it enacted the Lloyd-La Follette Act did so with the intention of conferring job protection rights on federal employees which they had not previously had, it obviously did not intend to authorize discharge under the Act's removal standard for speech which <span id="Page_2184"></span>is constitutionally protected. The Act proscribes only that public speech which improperly damages and impairs the reputation and efficiency of the employing agency, and it thus imposes no greater controls on the behavior of federal employees than are necessary for the protection of the Government as an employer. Indeed the Act is not directed at speech as such, but at employee behavior, including speech, which is detrimental to the efficiency of the employing agency. We hold that the language "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" in the Act excludes constitutionally protected speech, and that the statute is therefore not overbroad. <span class="Italic">Colten v. Kentucky,</span> 407 U.S., at 111, 92 S. Ct., at 1957. We have observed previously that the Court has a duty to construe a federal statute to avoid constitutional questions where such a construction is reasonably possible. <span class="Italic">United States v. 12 200--ft. Reels of Film,</span> 413 U.S. 123, 130 n.7, 93 S. Ct. 2665, 2670, 37 L. Ed.2d 500 (1973); <span class="Italic">United States v. Thirty-seven photographs,</span> 402 U.S. 363, 368-369, 91 S. Ct. 1400, 1404-1405, 28 L. Ed.2d 822 (1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no hesitation, as did the District Court, in saying that on the facts alleged in the administrative charges against appellee, the appropriate tribunal would infringe no constitutional right of appellee in concluding that there was "cause" for his discharge. <span class="Italic">Pickering v. Board of Education,</span> 391 U.S., at 569, 88 S. Ct., at 1735. Nor have we any doubt that satisfactory proof of these allegations could constitute "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" within the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501(a). Appellee's contention then boils down to the assertion that although no constitutionally protected conduct of his own was the basis for his discharge on the Government's version of the facts, the statutory language in question must be declared inoperative, and a set of more particularized regulations substituted for it, because the generality of its language might result in marginal situations in which other persons seeking to engage in constitutionally protected conduct would be deterred from doing so. But we have held that Congress in establishing a standard of "cause" for discharge did not intend to include within that term any constitutionally protected conduct. We think that our statement in <span class="Italic">Colten v. Kentucky,</span> is a complete answer to appellee's contention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"As we understand this case, appellant's own conduct was not immune under the First Amendment and neither is his conviction vulnerable on the ground that the statute threatens constitutionally protected conduct of others." 407 U.S., at 111, 92 S. Ct., at 1958.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold that the Lloyd-La Follette Act, in at once conferring upon nonprobationary federal employees the right not to be discharged except for "cause" and prescribing the procedural means by which that right was to be protected, did not create an expectancy of job retention in those employees requiring procedural protection under the Due Process Clause beyond that afforded here by the statute and related agency regulations. We also conclude that the post-termination hearing procedures provided by the Civil Service Commission and the OEO adequately protect those federal employees' liberty interest, recognized in <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in not being wrongfully stigmatized by untrue and unsupported administrative charges. Finally, we hold that the standard of employment protection imposed by Congress in the Lloyd-La Follette Act, is not impermissibly vague or overbroad in its regulation of the speech of federal employees and therefore unconstitutional on its face. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the District Court on both grounds on which it granted summary judgment and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An adverse action promotes the efficiency of the service if the grounds for the action relate either to an employee's failure to accomplish his duties satisfactorily or to some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">Hatfield v.

<p class="Body-Text">In determining whether adverse action promotes service efficiency, the court examines charges and conduct leading up to the proposal date.

<p class="Body-Text">Board decisions say little about service efficiency and how it is defined under 5 USC 7513(a). The issue is addressed tangentially rather than directly. The statutory formulation under 5 USC 7513, the standard for the efficiency of the service, encompasses burden of proof analysis, responsibility for conduct, nexus, imposition and mitigation of penalties, and the substantive elements of offenses charged against federal employees. Most of the remainder of this chapter will be concerned with the burden of proof and the element of personal responsibility in adverse action cases.</p>
