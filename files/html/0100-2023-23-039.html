<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-40"><span class="space">a.</span> Threat of Unwarranted Action; Duress</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The complaint that a settlement was coerced through an unwarranted threat of an adverse action arises in two situations. First, there is the appellant who typically receives an adverse action proposal and then enters into a settlement agreement, for example, a last chance agreement, and then finds himself on the receiving end of the decision withheld in the last chance agreement. The employee appeals, the agency responds with the appeal waiver in the LCA, and the employee counters with the argument that the waiver is invalid because it was the product of duress, i.e., the threat of an unwarranted action. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-160.html#sec2-158">Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement</a>."] Second, there is the settlement reached during a Board appeal. The appellant seeks to set that settlement aside for the same reason. In either situation, the Board's analysis is the same.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an appealed action, a threat during settlement discussions of a future disciplinary action may be ground for setting an agreement aside if the agency knows or should know that the threatened action cannot be substantiated. Although determining that the appellant did not submit evidence of the threatened subsequent action, <span class="Italic">Bowie v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 42, 44-45 (1996), informs us that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the court held that a threatened action by an agency is "purely coercive" if an employee can show that the agency knew or should have known that the reason for the threatened action could not be substantiated. The court reasoned that inherent in the proposition that an employee is merely faced with unpleasant alternatives when choosing between resigning or being subject to removal is the assumption that the agency has reasonable grounds for threatening to take the adverse action<span class="Italic">. See Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136. The Board applied <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> in a settlement context, finding that a proposed removal was not an improper coercive action resulting in an involuntary last-chance settlement agreement because the appellant did not show that the agency knew or should have known that it could not substantiate the reason for the threatened removal<span class="Italic">. See Merriweather Department of Transportation</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 371 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> applies to threats of disciplinary action made during settlement discussions before the Board. Inherent in the proposition that an appellant is merely faced with unpleasant alternatives when choosing between settling an appeal or being subsequently removed on other grounds if he or she wins a pending appeal, is the assumption that the agency has reasonable grounds for threatening to take such future action. Just as a fraudulent misrepresentation by an agency representative during settlement negotiations may be grounds for setting aside a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">see Nance v. Department of Transportation</span>, 55 MSPR 68, 71 (1992), a threatened future disciplinary action during settlement negotiations that the agency knows or should know cannot be substantiated may be grounds for setting aside an agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered whether a settlement entered prior to an appeal was coerced, and therefore no bar to the appeal, because the agency proposed or threatened an adverse action that it did not reasonably believe could be sustained in <span class="Italic">Perry v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 272, 279-80 (1997), reviewing and evaluating the evidence offered in the appellant's jurisdictional submissions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that his remarks to Mr. Perdomo were not a threat, and that the agency's evidence would not support a finding that he made a threat. If the appellant could show that the agency knew that the reason for the suspension action could not be substantiated, the action would be "purely coercive," and the resulting settlement agreement could be considered involuntary. <span class="Italic">Merriweather,</span> 64 MSPR at 370-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted a copy of a May 20, 1996 memorandum advising employees that all violence or threats of violence in the workplace are prohibited, and that, effective with the date of the memorandum, there would be "Zero Tolerance" for violation of that policy. He also submitted a sworn statement signed by him on October 23, 1996, in which he declared in response to the suspension that he told Perdomo in the parking lot that he (the appellant) "own[ed] a nine millimeter for self defense that assure[d him] that [Perdomo was] not going to make [him] do anything." The appellant's submissions also include signed statements from Mr. Perdomo and four coworkers who witnessed the incident.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the evidence supporting the action, the agency's zero-tolerance policy on violence or threats of violence in the workplace, and the nexus between the alleged conduct and the efficiency of the service, <span class="Italic">see McCarty v. Department of the Navy,</span> 67 MSPR 177, 182-83 (1995), we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency lacked a reasonable basis for placing him in non-pay status, and that it knew or should have known that it could not substantiate the reason for the action, <span class="Italic">see Merriweather</span>, 64 MSPR at 371.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">De Le Gal v. DOJ</span>, 79 MSPR 396, 401 (1998), one allegation was that the appellant's settlement, entered during the course of his appeal, was coerced because the agency knew or should have known that the appellant would prevail on his affirmative defense of whistleblowing. Although the Board acknowledged the general validity of the appellant's legal theory, the Board placed the burden of proof upon the appellant to demonstrate the agency's institutional state of mind:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Appellant] appears to argue that the settlement agreement was invalid because, based on its alleged knowledge of his protected disclosures, the agency knew or should have known that he would prevail on his affirmative defense of reprisal, and that, therefore, its adverse action could not be sustained. This contention lacks merit. To establish the affirmative defense of reprisal for whistleblowing activities, however, it is not sufficient for an appellant to merely show that he made protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Department of the Army,</span> 997 F.2d 1466, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1993). He must also show that the protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant has not submitted any evidence to show that he met this burden. Further, <span id="Page_4801"></span>even where an appellant shows that his protected disclosures were a contributing factor in the agency's action, he still will not prevail on his claim of reprisal if the agency shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is nothing in the record to show that the agency could not have met this test. Thus, the appellant has not shown that the agency knew or should have known that he would prevail on his reprisal claim, and that, consequently, its action could not be sustained.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit remanded a case that began when the appellant entered into a last chance settlement. The agency determined that the appellant violated the settlement and proposed the employee's dismissal. The parties then entered into a second "last chance" agreement, and the agency then removed the employee for an alleged violation of the second agreement. The court concluded that because the employer knew or should have known that the employee never violated the first agreement, the employee may have been coerced into signing the settlement agreement. The court directed the Board to consider the effect of the possible invalidity of the second agreement on the employee's removal, <span class="Italic">Fassett v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3271):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ronald A. Fassett appeals from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), No. PH-0752-96-0468-B-1 (Feb. 10, 1998), which became final on March 31, 1999. The Board affirmed the decision of the United States Postal Service ("USPS" or "agency") to remove Mr. Fassett from employment for violating a Last Chance Settlement Agreement. Because the Board appears to have erred in finding that Fassett violated an earlier Last Chance Settlement Agreement, we vacate and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 28, 1995, the USPS sent Mr. Fassett a Notice of Proposed Removal in which it proposed to remove him from his position as a Full-time Letter Carrier because he tested positive for illegal drugs after a vehicle accident on September 5, 1995. On October 17, 1995, Mr. Fassett executed a Last Chance Settlement Agreement ("LCSA"), which allowed him to return to work on October 21, 1995, at the conclusion of a 40-day suspension. The LCSA contained the following provision requiring Mr. Fassett to submit to drug testing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The employee will be required to have a mandatory urinalysis every two (2) weeks (biweekly) for three months and monthly for the following three months and assume the financial cost of these tests. After six months and up to one year from the date of this settlement, management may require a random urinalysis with the Postal Service incurring the financial cost of the test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 16, 1996, the day after he submitted to a biweekly urinalysis, and three months after the LCSA was entered into, Mr. Fassett refused to follow a direct order from his station manager instructing him to submit to a urinalysis. On February 5, 1996, the USPS sent Mr. Fassett a Notice of Proposed Removal in which it proposed to remove him because he failed to comply with the random urinalysis provision of the October 17 LCSA. The Notice stated that Mr. Fassett's earlier 40-day suspension after the vehicle accident would also be considered in determining whether he should be removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Fassett began serving a suspension on March 11, 1996. On April 23, 1996, he entered into a second LCSA under which he would return to work on May 11, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second LCSA extended the first LCSA by three months and required Mr. Fassett to submit to biweekly urinalysis during the extended period and assume the cost himself. The second LCSA also provided that Mr. Fassett could be subjected to a random urinalysis at any time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Fassett did not take any drug tests between May 11, 1996, and July 1, 1996, during which time in accordance with the second LCSA he was required to submit to biweekly testing. On July 18, 1996, the USPS sent Mr. Fassett a Proposed Notice of Removal in which it proposed to remove Mr. Fassett because he failed to comply with the second LCSA. The Notice stated that Mr. Fassett's 40-day suspension for testing positive after the accident and his 60-day suspension for violating the first LCSA would also be considered in determining whether he should be removed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 31, 1996, the USPS sent Mr. Fassett a letter stating its decision to remove him effective September 4, 1996. The letter stated that the USPS considered his past record, including the 40-day and 60-day suspensions, in addition to his violation of the second LCSA. Mr. Fassett appealed his removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision on January 14, 1997, an administrative judge ("AJ") dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that Mr. Fassett had waived his appeal rights when he signed both LCSAs. On August 18, 1997, the Board vacated the initial decision and remanded for adjudication on the merits because it concluded that Mr. Fassett did not waive his appeal rights from any disciplinary action taken by the agency for his violation of the LCSAs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ affirmed the agency's removal of Mr. Fassett. The AJ found that Mr. Fassett's failure to submit to biweekly testing under the second LCSA should not be excused due to his alleged financial difficulties and recovery from outpatient surgery. The AJ also determined that the second LCSA was valid because Mr. Fassett voluntarily signed it and there was no fraud or mutual mistake when it was signed. The AJ affirmed Mr. Fassett's removal after concluding that removal promoted the efficiency of the agency's service and was a reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied Mr. Fassett's petition for review of the initial decision. Vice Chair Slavet dissented because she found Mr. Fassett did not violate the first LCSA by refusing to submit to a random urinalysis within the first three months of the agreement. Thus, in her view, the second LCSA was involuntary due to the agency's coercion in threatening to remove Mr. Fassett for violating the first LCSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the decision of the Board unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his second initial decision, the AJ erred in his determination of one key fact--whether Mr. Fassett violated the first LCSA. The initial decision states that the agency could require Mr. Fassett to submit to random testing at any time during the first year after the first LCSA was signed. This is contradictory to the plain language of the LCSA, which provides for random testing "[a]fter six months and up to one year" from the date of the LCSA, i.e., only during the second six months. Thus, Mr. Fassett's refusal to submit to testing on January 16, 1996, within the first three months of the LCSA, was not a violation of the first LCSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement may be involuntary, and thus invalid, if it was reached by virtue of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The AJ concluded in the initial decision that the second LCSA was valid because he erroneously found that Mr. Fassett had violated the first LCSA. Because Mr. Fassett's alleged violation of the first LCSA was the basis for his February 5, 1996 proposed removal, which led to Mr. Fassett's execution of the second LCSA, the validity of this second LCSA is suspect. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for reconsideration of the validity of the second LCSA, in accordance with the Board's jurisprudence, in light of the apparent fact that Mr. Fassett did not violate the first LCSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board concludes that the second LCSA was invalid, Mr. Fassett's alleged violation of the second LCSA cannot be a basis for his removal. It is possible that the Board may conclude that, for other reasons not in the record before us, the second LCSA was valid despite the fact that Mr. Fassett did not violate the first LCSA. If the Board so concludes, the Board nevertheless is instructed to reconsider the agency's removal decision. In particular, the Board should properly consider Mr. Fassett's past disciplinary record, taking into account that the 60-day suspension in 1996 may have been imposed erroneously because Mr. Fassett appears not to have violated the terms of the first LCSA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board set aside Mr. Fassett's removal, <span class="Italic">Fassett v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 677, 679-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-8 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may demonstrate that a settlement agreement was coerced, and thus, involuntary, by showing that the agency threatened to take a future disciplinary action that it knew or should have known could not <span id="Page_4802"></span>be substantiated. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 81 0 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Under the terms of the first LCSA, executed on October 17, 1995, the appellant agreed: (1) to submit to and pay for biweekly scheduled mandatory urinalyses for a 3-month period; (2) to submit to and pay for monthly scheduled urinalyses for an additional 3 months; and (3) to submit to management-directed random urinalyses at agency expense after 6 months and up to a year from the date of the settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant refused to submit to an agency-ordered urinalysis on January 16, 1996, during the first 3 months of the agreement. During this period, the LCSA required the appellant only to submit to biweekly scheduled urinalyses. The appellant submitted evidence to establish that he submitted to a biweekly scheduled urinalysis the previous day. Thus, the first LCSA did not confer upon the agency the authority to order the appellant to submit to an additional urinalysis on January 16, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, when the agency proposed the appellant's removal for his refusal to submit to the agency-ordered urinalysis, the agency charged the appellant only with failure to comply with the terms of the LCSA. Because the express terms of the agreement did not require the appellant to submit to this drug test, the agency should have known that the appellant's removal based on this charge could not be substantiated. Therefore, the appellant's removal for violating the terms of the first LCSA was purely coercive. <span class="Italic">See Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136. We note, as did the Federal Circuit, that the agency may have properly disciplined the appellant for his refusal to comply with his supervisor's order to submit to the January 16, 1996 urinalysis if the agency had established that it had proper authority to order the test<span class="Italic">. See Fassett v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> Docket No. 99-3271, 2000 WL 198072 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 18, 2000), slip op. at 5 and n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in proposing the appellant's removal for refusing to submit to the drug test on January 16, 1996, the agency relied exclusively on the provisions of the LCSA to justify its order. It offered no evidence to establish that the order was reasonable pursuant to an agency drug-testing program, or based on reasonable suspicion, or required by a law, rule, regulation, or contract other than the first LCSA. Thus, the agency did not establish that it had the authority, independent of the first LCSA, to require the appellant to submit to a drug test on January 16, 1996. Furthermore, even if the agency had established such authority, the Board could not have sustained the charge against the appellant because the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR 606, 609 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we must set aside the second LCSA as involuntary due to the agency's coercion in removing the appellant on a charge that it should have known it could not substantiate. <span class="Italic">See Schultz,</span> 810 F.2d at 1136. Because we have set aside the LCSA that served as the basis for the agency's action, we REVERSE the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A statement to an appellant by an agency representative that the appellant would not prevail in a petition for enforcement is not a threatening statement serving to vitiate a settlement. <span class="Italic">Schultz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 667, 670 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Frizzell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 413, 416 (1992) (settlement during Board appeal: finding the allegation that the appellant received threats of a poor recommendation if he did not sign an agreement insufficient to set aside the agreement; the statements, if made, would not suffice to establish coercion; also finding insufficient to establish coercion the refusal by the agency to allow the appellant to insert in his agreement the words "under duress" next to his signature (citing <span class="Italic">Moran v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 547, 553 (1990) (appeal from a resignation that followed an adverse action proposal: an "agency's threat of possible criminal prosecution does not constitute duress sufficient to invalidate a settlement agreement"))).
