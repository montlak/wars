<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-137"><span class="space">3.</span> Withdrawal of Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellants may initiate Board appeals; they may withdraw them. The decisions that follow result from the efforts by appellants to reinstate appeals earlier withdrawn. Because the withdrawal of an appeal is a matter of jurisdictional consequence, and because the Board's jurisdiction is always at issue, the existence or legitimacy of the withdrawal of the appeal may be raised at any time during a proceeding, or the Board may raise that issue on its own<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DeLoach v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 108 MSPR 485, 2008 MSPB 78 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unconditional withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes the appeal from Board jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Kravitz v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 44, 46-48 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue now before us is whether an appellant may withdraw her appeal before the Board, regardless of the agency's agreement, acquiescence, or objection, prior to issuance of a final Board order. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that, generally speaking, it is the appellant's right to withdraw her appeal regardless of the agency's view on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in this case filed her Board appeal under 5 USC 8347(d)(1) which provides that "an administrative action or order [of OPM] affecting the [civil service retirement] rights or interests of an individual or of the United States...may be appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board." We are aware of no statutory provision stating that, once an individual elects to exercise her statutory right to appeal an OPM action or order to the Board, she may not subsequently elect to withdraw that appeal unilaterally; and OPM has not asserted that any such provision exists. Further, nothing in the Board's regulations provides that an appellant may not withdraw her appeal at any time prior to the issuance of the Board's final order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving Special Counsel complaints seeking disciplinary action against Federal employees for allegedly committing prohibited personnel practices, and other agency's complaints seeking Board approval of adverse personnel actions against administrative law judges, the Board has held that, in considering a complainant's motion for a voluntary dismissal, it must consider primarily the interests of the respondents. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Parra</span>, 49 MSPR 123, 125 (1991); <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Beddow</span>, 47 MSPR 103, 105 (1991); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Abell</span>, 47 MSPR 98, 101 (1991). The Board will grant such a motion unless the non-moving party would suffer a clear legal prejudice. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Parra</span>, 49 MSPR at 125; <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Beddow</span>, 47 MSPR at 105; <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Abell</span>, 47 MSPR at 101. Here, the agency has not identified how it would be prejudiced by the Board's dismissing this appeal pursuant to her request to withdraw it, and we can discern no possible prejudice.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;It is difficult to foresee a circumstance in which an appellant's decision to withdraw a Board appeal with prejudice to refiling could prejudice an agency. An agency claiming such prejudice has a difficult burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1079"></span>In its decisions in <span class="Italic">Parra</span>, <span class="Italic">Beddow</span>, and <span class="Italic">Abell</span>, the Board referred to Rule 41(a)(2), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, regarding the voluntary dismissal of an action. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Parra</span>, 49 MSPR at 125; <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Beddow</span>, 47 MSPR at 105, <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Abell</span>, 47 MSPR at 100; Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2). That rule affords a plaintiff the right to dismiss an action "upon an order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper." Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2). Although Rule 41(a)(2) ordinarily applies to dismissals without prejudice, it specifically applies to dismissals with prejudice as well. Nothing in Rule 41(a)(2) requires that the opposing parties agree to the dismissal of an action for a court to act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The intent of the "terms and conditions" clause in Rule 41(a)(2) is to protect a defendant from any prejudice or inconvenience that might result from the plaintiff's voluntary dismissal, and attorney fees are commonly awarded to the defendant as a "term and condition." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Taragan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, we may look to them for guidance. <span class="Italic">See Hebert v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 68, 72 (1993); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Parra</span>, 49 MSPR at 125. Here, we believe that Rule 41(a)(2) supports the holding that the Board may dismiss an appeal based solely on an appellant's request, provided that the opposing party would not be prejudiced. As noted above, the agency here has not identified how it would be prejudiced by the Board's dismissing the appeal pursuant to the appellant's request to withdraw it, and we can discern no possible prejudice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "with prejudice" is implicitly defined in <span class="italic">Sanders v. DHS</span>, DE-0752-17-0238-I-1 (NP 7/25/2022): "we find that dismissing the appeal 'with prejudice to refiling' (i.e., the parties normally may not refile this appeal) is appropriate under these circumstances."

<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he appellant's counsel indicated that the appellant had authorized him to withdraw this appeal as the appellant no longer wished to pursue it....&#8197;I then accepted the withdrawal as knowingly and freely made after satisfying myself that the appellant and his counsel understood that the withdrawal would result in my dismissing the appeal with prejudice to refiling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">DECISION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This initial decision became the Board's final decision, as neither party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant IRA appeal, filed in May 2015, the appellant asserted that his July 2013 removal constituted retaliation for whistleblowing disclosures he allegedly made in 2011. The agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal arguing, among other things, that the appeal should be barred under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. The administrative judge allowed the appellant an opportunity to respond to the motion to dismiss, and the appellant did so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, the administrative judge found that the IRA appeal was barred under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, concluding that all three of the elements were satisfied for the application of that doctrine: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction (the MSPB); (2) the prior decision was a final decision on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action (the appellant's removal) and the same parties were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The administrative judge noted that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> bars not only claims that a party raised, but also claims that the party could have raised in the earlier action. <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 337. Here, the appellant could have raised, but did not, the affirmative defense of whistleblower retaliation in the adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the administrative judge "did not formally designate that [the adverse action appeal] was dismissed 'with prejudice' and Appellant did not understand that the proceeding was so dismissed thereby precluding this appeal. The earlier order simply pronounces the Appeal was 'dismissed.'" This argument is disingenuous. Although the administrative judge did not repeat the phrase "with prejudice" in the final sentence of his initial decision, he expressly stated that he accepted the withdrawal only after assuring himself "that the appellant and his counsel understood that the withdrawal would result in my dismissing the appeal with prejudice to refiling." The Board has found that a voluntary dismissal with prejudice does constitute a decision on the merits, barring relitigation under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 10 (2006); <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 485, 489 (1990).

Since conference summaries ordinarily provide a few days for either side to offer corrections or objections, the parties can then advise the AJ of any error in the AJ's conclusions about the parties' statements, and the parties can avoid the situation in <span class="Italic">Krisovitch v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 611, 614 (1991), when the appellant's PFR brought into dispute the communications to the AJ and the Board was required to remand the case to the AJ to determine if the appellant agreed to divestiture of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Appell v.

The AJ further stated that, "[b]ecause it appears that it is the appellant's intention that this appeal be withdrawn, he is hereby notified that his appeal will be dismissed unless he is able to show that such action should not occur," and that such a showing must be in writing and must be submitted by November 5, 1999.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board remanded a case to the AJ after the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn by the appellant based on a settlement reached in a grievance proceeding. There was no record evidence that the appellant actually withdrew her appeal and nothing to show that the AJ made any attempt to contact the appellant to determine if she was withdrawing her appeal based on the settlement. The proper approach would have been to dismiss the appeal as settled, but the record was unclear on that process too, since the AJ did not ascertain whether the parties' agreement was reached knowingly, voluntarily, and whether the parties desired Board enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Cason v.

The appellant again responded: "Yea." The administrative judge then stated that he would be issuing an initial decision dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's mere acquiescence in statements made by the administrative judge does not clearly show that he intended to withdraw his petition for appeal. The record below and the appellant's petition for review indicate that he is confused because he believes that he "won" after the first initial decision remanding his appeal to OPM for adjudication on the merits was issued. Moreover, the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and he admittedly cannot fully comprehend English.

Further, the petition for review indicates that the appellant continues to have questions as to what was supposed to happen to his appeal.

We hold that this unequivocal warning was sufficient to inform Conde that his withdrawal would result in a dismissal with prejudice. The fact that the AJ might not have used the term "prejudice" does not render the warning insufficient. While Conde did not have the assistance of counsel, in the absence of persuasive evidence to the contrary, the clear and plain meaning of the AJ's warning was sufficient to inform Conde of the effect of his withdrawal. Importantly, Conde has neither argued, nor submitted any evidence to indicate, that he made any statements during the October 5 conference indicating that <span id="Page_1081"></span>he intended to preserve the opportunity to re-file a Board appeal on this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conde's only evidence to indicate that he did not appreciate the effect of his withdrawal is his October 31 letter to the AJ. In the letter, however, Conde does not state that he had believed that his withdrawal would result in a dismissal without prejudice.</p>
