<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-79"><span class="space">2.</span> Calculating Year of Service</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Many former employees would subscribe to a description of probation as "beautiful and simple as all truly great swindles are." (O. Henry, <span class="Italic">The Gentle Grafter</span>.) The same could be said for at least a few personnel officers who have been taken in by the seeming simplicity of probation and trial periods, terms occasionally used interchangeably, although the trial period is applied to the first year of a term employee. We may refer to a "waiting period"" as the time spent accumulating necessary "current continuous" service. Reference will also be made to the one-year probation for a first-time supervisor, discussed later in this chapter. Discussed below, 5 CFR 315.804 (2022) references procedures for termination of probationers for unsatisfactory performance or conduct and 5 CFR 315.805 (2022) references procedures for termination of probationers for conditions arising before appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 315.802 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Length of probationary period; crediting service.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The probationary period required by &#x00A7; 315.801 is 1 year and may not be extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Prior Federal civilian service (including nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of probation when the prior service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is in the same agency, e.g., Department of the Army;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is in the same line of work (determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of probation. Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount. An employee serving probation who leaves Federal service to become a volunteer with the Peace Corps or the Corporation for National and Community Service serves the remainder of the probationary period upon reinstatement provided the employee is reinstated within 90 days of termination of service as a volunteer or training for such service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The probationary period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. For intermittent employees, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty, each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion of probation. (However, the probationary period cannot be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the record, OPM defines trial period at 5 CFR 316.304 (2022) as the first year of service of a term employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Trial period</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The first year of service of a term employee is a trial period regardless of the method of appointment. Prior Federal civilian service is credited toward completion of the required trial period in the same manner as prescribed by &#x00A7; 315.802 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The agency may terminate a term employee at any time during the trial period. The employee is entitled to the procedures set forth in &#x00A7; 315.804 or &#x00A7; 315.805 of this chapter as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding the record, the Board may speak of "trial period" in the sense of the time an excepted service employee must serve before Board adverse action appeal rights vest. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">El v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 123 MSPR 76, 81-82 n.5, 2015 MSPB 64 (2015) ("As an employee in the excepted service, the appellant was serving in his trial period and not his probationary period." (Other decisions relating to the same appellant reference an excepted service appointment subject to a one-year trial period based on the appellant's preference eligible status.)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis of acquisition of appeal rights begins with the definition of what constitutes one year of employment, a requirement common to appointees of the competitive service and preference eligibles of the excepted service. Disregarding the effect of the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Act on nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service, the traditional probationary, trial, or waiting period is a year in duration (two years for DOD probationers: 10 USC 1599e).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant does not satisfy the definition of "employee" set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because she has not completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. The appellant's argument that her probationary period began on the date that she was sworn in, October 31, 2008, is unavailing because it is undisputed that her appointment was effective November 23, 2008, and that she began federal service under the supervision of a federal employee on November 24, 2008. <span class="Italic">See Bilodeau v. American Battle Monuments Commission</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 243, 249-251 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) (to be considered a federal employee, the individual must be actually engaging in the performance of a federal function under supervision by an appropriate official). Thus, her November 18, 2010 termination was less than 2 years after she began her federal service, which precludes her from satisfying the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Because the Board examines the action as it stood when the appellant filed his appeal, if the agency terminates an employee after he completes probation, the agency may not divest the Board of jurisdiction after an appeal is filed by unilaterally and retroactively changing the effective times or dates on its personnel action paperwork. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stanley v. DOJ</span>, 58 MSPR 354, 357 (1993). The employee may not extend probation by attempting to remain at the job following her separation date. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Golding v. Weeks</span>, 225 F.2d 31, 32 (D.C. Cir. 1955) ("She did not lose her status as a probationer, and gain a more permanent status, by her conduct in continuing to report to work. Nor did the Government lose its right to discharge her because someone continued to give her work to do for a short time, and caused her to be paid for it.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee who was terminated within the period of probation but returned to the agency later for a day, and was paid while he completed "out-processing," did not extend his employment even though he was apparently paid for the day he returned, <span class="Italic">Nicholas v. VA</span>, AT-315H-11-0328-I-1 (NP 10/26/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant argued that he remained an employee after his probationary period ended on December 5, 2010. The agency's letter and the appellant's Standard Form (SF) 50 state that his termination was effective December 2, 2010; however, he did not complete out-processing, including clearance of any indebtedness to the agency, until December 9, 2010. On review, the appellant reasserts this argument, contending that he did not learn that he had to clear any indebtedness to the agency until December 6, 2010, and he was still an agency employee until he finished out-processing on December 9, 2010....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The witness accounts are set forth on agency Report of Contact forms. The form dated December 6, 2010, recounts a conversation that day between the appellant and Brian Dyer, Assistant Chief of Environmental Services, during which Dyer asked the appellant to visit his office on December 8, 2010. The form dated December 9, 2010, recounts a telephone conversation that day between the appellant and Dyer, during which Dyer allegedly agreed to pay him for the time he spent out-processing on December 9, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was undisputedly within his probationary period on December 2, 2010, when he received the termination letter. We find the appellant's argument that he remained an employee until he completed out-processing to be without merit. Because the appellant worked at night, and received his termination notice on its effective date, it is unlikely that the agency could have completed out-processing before December 3, 2010. Moreover, the decision to delay clearance of indebtedness appears to have been within the appellant's own control. The agency asserted that he "received his termination paperwork on December 2, 2010...and possessed the ability to surrender his key and identification badge when he received the letter of termination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's Reports of Contact indicate that he may have been promised payment for time spent in out-processing activities, he has not shown that he encumbered the position through that date. <span class="Italic">Cf. Coleman v. Department of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 436, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2007) (where the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he was in leave without pay status when his probationary period ended, and supported that allegation by submitting leave and earnings statements, the Board remanded the appeal for a jurisdictional hearing). Accordingly, the appellant has not offered any evidence showing that he remained in the agency's employ after December 2, 2010. The termination date stated on his SF-50 thus is controlling, and the agency conducted its out-processing activities after his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency would ideally collect property and complete out-processing before an employee's termination, collection of property is fundamentally a ministerial task. The other aspects of out-processing that the appellant has documented, including the preparation of notices regarding his health and life insurance coverage, are similarly administrative. We conclude that out-processing falls into the same class of activities as the preparation of the SF-50 documenting a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (failure to issue an SF-50 prior to expiration of the probationary period did not extend the period, as issuance of the SF-50 is merely an administrative task). We thus reject the appellant's claim that agency policy <span class="Italic">required</span> him to be an employee at the time of out-processing. We also note that we found no evidence in the record that would support his allegation of disparate treatment in this respect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hardy v. MSPB</span>, 13 F.3d 1571, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (probationer's appointment did not ripen into a tenured position because his pay continued for a period following his termination: "[T]he relevant question is whether the agency has taken all steps required by law to complete a personnel action, not whether every subsequent administrative detail has been fulfilled.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recall that calculation of probation is but part of the analysis in some appeals. In the competitive service, the one-year qualifying period must be served either through completion of probation or a waiting period under an initial appointment, or through completion of one year of current, continuous employment under an appointment other than a temporary appointment limited to a year or less. The preference eligible in the excepted service or Postal Service acquires regular appeal rights if he has completed one year of current, continuous service in the same or a similar position. Common to both types of appointments is the concept of current, continuous service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. Dept. of State</span>, 102 MSPR 79, 2006 MSPB 129 (2006) (decision discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-081.html#sec1-80">Incorrect Determination of Duration of Probation</a>"). The competitive service employee must be concerned about the limitations of short-term temporary appointments. The excepted service employee need be concerned about the meaning of "same or similar position" if that employee has served in different positions during the initial one-year waiting period. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-051.html#sec1-52">Current Continuous Service</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing courts may not prove particularly benevolent toward appellants who seek liberal interpretation of the regulations defining the service required prior to acquisition of tenure. <span class="Italic">Ajmani v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 712 F.2d 1485, 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Angell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 266, 4 MSPB 340 (1980)), remarked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certainty about the duration of the probationary period is important both to the government and to probationary employees. Should this court embark upon a course of deciding individual cases according to its understanding of when the policy underlying the requirement of a probationary period is adequately fulfilled, not only would we invite a flood of litigation, but we would create an incentive for government agencies to discharge marginal probationers early in all cases where there was doubt whether prior service would be counted as part of the probationary period. This would serve no one's interest. Perhaps that could be cured by a rewriting of the regulations, but petitioner has offered us no adequate reason why the present regulations are not clear enough so that they may not be equitably applied to their plain language in this case.</p>
