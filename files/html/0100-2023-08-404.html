<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-397"><span class="space">E.</span> EVIDENCE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The admissibility and reliability of hearsay information contained in an OPM investigative report was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Forbez v. DOJ</span>, 36 MSPR 185, 189 n.5 (1988). <span class="Italic">Forbez</span> noted consistent accounts by a variety of witnesses addressing the same events--statements corroborated by documentary evidence including the appellant's written statements and admissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The use of investigative reports during the suitability and <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appellate processes was discussed in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 289, 293-98 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the presiding official found in the initial decision that OPM had failed to prove a pattern of delinquency or misconduct in prior employment, and had also failed to demonstrate that the appellant's record of criminal conduct was a sufficient predictor of his unsuitability for employment in the federal competitive service. He therefore reversed OPM's determination on the basis that it was not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM contends that the presiding official should have confined his review to the evidence in the administrative record before OPM when it made the suitability determination, and that he erred in conducting what amounted to a "trial <span class="Italic">de novo</span>," substituting his judgment for that of the agency. OPM further contends that in light of the evidence, the presiding official erred in finding that: (1) appellant's alleged delinquency or misconduct in prior employment failed to show a pattern of conduct which would be incompatible with successful performance in the position for which he had applied; and (2) appellant's past criminal conduct was outweighed by sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the petition for review raises significant issues concerning the scope of the Board's review of suitability determinations and the weight given to the evidence by the presiding official in reversing the agency determination, we hereby GRANT the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its contention that appellant's prior employment history establishes a pattern of conduct incompatible with successful performance in the position for which he had applied, the agency argues that the presiding official erred in according less weight to its Investigation Report describing the three incidents of alleged misconduct than to appellant's sworn testimony at the hearing concerning his prior termination. In <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77 (1981), we determined that the presiding official had improperly relied upon unsigned hearsay statements contained in the agency investigatory file where they were contradicted by live testimony at the hearing. There, we noted that although hearsay evidence alone may under certain circumstances constitute substantial evidence, hearsay evidence meeting the substantial evidence test would not necessarily satisfy the preponderance standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 157, 5 MSPR 87. Thus, after determining whether the hearsay evidence has significant probative value, the Board must determine whether it is outweighed by the other evidence of record, including appellant's oral testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the first incident, the presiding official noted that appellant's denial that he made a racial slur and initiated the fight at the Sheraton Park Hotel was deserving of more weight than the OPM Investigator's summary of an apparently unsworn statement from an unidentified person. We agree. The Investigation Report "sanitized" out the name of the OPM investigator. The source of the information from the temporary personnel agency was also sanitized, because confidentiality had been granted to him.[3] Approximately three-fourths of the information contained in the summary report was blacked out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Doe v. U</span>.<span class="Italic">S. Civil Service Comm'n</span>, 483 F. Supp. 539, 579 (S.D.N.Y. 1980), involving a closely analogous situation in which derogatory allegations provided to CSC investigators by unidentified informants were relied upon in plaintiff Doe's non-selection for a White House Fellowship, the court stated that "...if the CSC refuses to remove the derogatory reports from Doe's file and to concede that their probative value is outweighed by the other investigatory reports and the statements submitted by Doe, then the agency must permit Doe to confront and question the sources who made the allegations against her." This conclusion, rested by the court on the Due Process Clause, makes it doubtful that OPM can rely upon derogatory statements of unidentified informants as to disputed facts in defending negative suitable determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as a result of the grant of confidentiality, it is impossible to ascertain from the sanitized summary the basis of the source's knowledge of the altercation at the Sheraton Park Hotel. However, it is reasonable to presume that since the source provided OPM's investigator with appellant's employment record information at the agency's offices, the source was a regular employee at that office and was not likely to have been a witness to the reported incident. The source's information was, therefore, at least secondhand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the incident at the Washington Hilton, the presiding official noted that the appellant's denial that he called the Head Steward a slanderous name or precipitated a fight was deserving of more weight than the OPM investigator's summary of an unsworn statement by a person who did not witness the incident. We agree with this finding. The OPM investigative report summarizes the information obtained from the Executive Steward of the Washington Hilton Hotel and a hotel security officer. These statements, as summarized by the OPM investigator, reflect a lack of firsthand knowledge relevant to the critical issue to be determined by OPM--whether appellant's conduct was responsible for the altercation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we agree with the presiding official's finding that in the absence of any affidavits, witnesses, or other evidence produced by OPM which would tend to corroborate its investigative finding with respect to appellant's employment history, appellant's live exculpatory testimony had greater probative force.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statements to OPM's investigator were double hearsay, since (1) the informants lacked firsthand knowledge of the events they described and (2), even as to what they had heard, the informants were not produced as witnesses. OPM's investigator was not a witness at the Board's hearing, thus making the reported statements triple hearsay. The Court of Claims has noted that "This type of attenuated and highly unreliable evidence is qualitatively, at best, triple hearsay. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. United States</span>, 639 F.2d 727, 730, 226 Ct. Cl. 75 (1980). OPM could have eliminated one entire level of hearsay by presenting its investigator as a witness. While the investigator could not have vouched for the truth of the information he had received, he could at least have described the circumstances in which he received that information, the basis of his informants' knowledge of the events in question, and related facts that might have enabled the presiding official to attribute some probative value to that information. Similarly, OPM could have provided affidavits from its informants with no apparent administrative burden of expense. It stretches credulity to expect the Board, in a matter fraught with Due Process implications, to rely upon non-verbatim hearsay accounts by an unidentified investigator as to what he or she was told in unsworn interviews with persons some of whom are themselves unidentified and all of whom lacked firsthand knowledge of the incidents in question. <span class="Italic">See generally Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice, supra</span>, and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's termination from employment at the restaurant, the OPM investigator's report indicated that the Head Chef stated that either appellant would have to go or she was going to go. The manager stated that the Head Chef was too valuable an employee to lose <span id="Page_788"></span>and therefore he had no choice but to terminate appellant. The presiding official concluded that there was nothing in this incident which would constitute delinquency or misconduct on appellant's part. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, OPM failed to establish by the preponderance of the evidence that appellant was at fault in being terminated from prior employment. The evidence concerning appellant's alleged delinquency or misconduct in prior employment did not warrant a finding of unsuitability. OPM failed to show a pattern of conduct which would be incompatible with successful performance in the position for which appellant had applied. Therefore, we find no error in the presiding official's weighing of this evidence and his credibility determinations as to this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM further contends that the presiding official erred in finding that appellant's criminal conduct was outweighed by sufficient evidence of rehabilitation. In determining an applicant's or eligible's suitability, OPM must consider the recency and circumstances surrounding the criminal conduct as well as the absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts towards rehabilitation by the applicant. 5 CFR 731.202(c). A finding of insufficient rehabilitation by OPM thus is one of the factors OPM must be able to support by the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the presiding official conceded that questions persisted regarding the extent of appellant's rehabilitation, he concluded that OPM had not demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant's absence of rehabilitation made him unfit for the position he sought. We disagree. We find that although appellant's convictions may have occurred between four and six years prior to OPM's finding of adverse suitability, they support OPM's determination because of their violent nature and the recency of similar conduct by appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record establishes that appellant was convicted of five criminal offenses involving assaults and possession of weapons between 1973 and 1978. At the time OPM made its adverse suitability determination, and at the time of the initial decision, appellant was on probation for a February 1978 assault conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 1979, only a few months prior to OPM's adverse suitability determination, appellant was arrested for an assault in which he waved a bottle in a threatening manner. This arrest violated a condition of appellant's February 1978 probation. Although one of the charges stemming from the February 1979 incident was dropped, two were still pending against him. While appellant has not been convicted of these charges, his explanation of the incident--that someone tried to trip him as he was walking down the street and that he therefore waved a bottle at this person--is not convincingly exculpatory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, appellant's probation officer told the OPM investigator that appellant was still frequently involved with fights after his last arrest, Appellant never denied the facts set forth in this portion of the investigation report. Furthermore, the probation officer's statements are entitled to significant probative value under the standards enunciated in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof, supra</span>, 5 MSPB 156-57, 5 MSPR 86-87. The officer is identified by name in OPM's investigative report and must be considered an impartial source. In addition, he based this information on his personal observations of appellant and on interviews with appellant on a number of occasions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is further undisputed that appellant falsified his SF-171 in 1977 by failing to disclose his criminal record. Although not cited by OPM as a basis for its suitability determination, this demonstrates serious deficiencies in appellant's credibility such that OPM's finding of insufficient rehabilitation is supported by the preponderance of the evidence in light of the probation officer's statements and other evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of this evidence, we hold that OPM properly determined that appellant was ineligible for federal employment, after considering the absence of rehabilitation as required by 5 CFR 731.202(c). Despite a year of psychotherapy sessions, appellant continued to engage in violent conduct during probation for his February 1978 assault conviction. Thus, we find that the initial decision must be reversed and OPM's adverse suitability determination sustained on the basis of appellant's criminal record. However, our finding that OPM's adverse determination is sustained does not bar appellant from reapplying for federal employment and having a new suitability determination made on the basis of his current rehabilitation status.</p>
