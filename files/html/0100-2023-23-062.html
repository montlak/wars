<p class="Body-Text">Should the appellant prevail in his attempt to set aside an agreement, he may be obligated to repay the back pay that he received under the agreement, although the law is not settled as to when that obligation arises and when funds must be repaid. <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 154, 157 (1987) ("If the settlement agreement is declared void, however, appellant will be obligated to repay the back pay which he received under the agreement."). Of the necessity to return benefits received under a settlement the appellant has reason to set aside, <span class="Italic">Burke v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BURKE_JOHN_E_CH_1221_09_0288_C_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1048536.pdf">121 MSPR 299</a>, 307 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2014 MSPB 48 (2014), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When one party commits a material breach of a settlement agreement, the other party ordinarily is entitled to either enforce the settlement agreement or to rescind it and to reinstate his appeal. <span class="Italic">Kitt</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6; 12. If a settlement agreement is rescinded, the settlement terms become inoperative, and the parties are essentially restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Eagleheart</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 15. An appellant who chooses to rescind a settlement agreement risks losing any benefits he received under the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the benefits the appellant received included not only significant financial benefits but also reassignment to a position in another state. The appellant has made clear that he is unwilling to give up those benefits in order to continue pursuing his IRA appeal. Therefore, the Board cannot order rescission of the settlement agreement and reinstatement of the IRA appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Galloway v. USDA</span>, 398 Fed. Appx. 591, 596 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) ("Rescinding the agreement would undo all of the settlement terms, causing Mr. Galloway to lose any benefits he received under the agreement--including the $83,000 payment that the agency made to Mr. Galloway. <span class="Italic">See Mullins v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, 212 (1998) (explaining the effect of rescinding a settlement agreement and remanding 'to permit the appellant to make an informed choice' whether to pursue rescission)."); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. USDA</span>, 55 MSPR 499, 503 n.2 (1992) ("In the event the Board found it in noncompliance, the agency requested "verbiage" in our opinion "to the effect" that the appellant will be liable for the $22,000 he received under the agreement if he sets the agreement aside and then loses on the merits. We decline this invitation to include such an advisory opinion. At present, there is no dispute over that money because the appellant has not claimed the right to keep it irrespective of the outcome of any future Board proceedings"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 114 MSPR 11, 2010 MSPB 72 (2010) (discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," suggesting that if the agency sought to recover the consideration paid in a settlement that was breached by the appellant, it would properly seek to rescind the agreement that was breached, requiring restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, including reinstatement of the underlying appeal); <span class="Italic">Allen v. OPM,</span> 77 MSPR 212, 222 n.7 (1998) (suggesting that if individuals who have received incentive payments upon retirement successfully challenge those retirements, they may be required to repay the voluntary separation incentive).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's obligation to repay what he received from a rescinded agreement was explored as to counsel fees paid under the agreement in <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 124, 127-29 (1994), the Board declining to stay the proceedings until the agency received reimbursement of those fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our March 31, 1994 order vacated the initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled and remanded the appeal for adjudication on the merits. By setting aside the agreement, our decision essentially restored the parties to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and released the parties from their duties under the settlement agreement. We find that inherent in the Board's authority to set aside a settlement agreement is the authority to order a party to take action necessary for the restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; otherwise, the setting aside of the agreement would be without effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's counsel is not a party to the appeal and the Board has no authority to order him to reimburse the agency, the appellant is a party to the appeal and is subject to an order requiring compliance under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2).[3] Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), the Board may order "any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board...and enforce compliance with any such order." Thus, the Board has the authority to order the appellant to reimburse the agency in the amount of the attorney fees paid to his attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In this connection, we note that there is an indication in the record that the appellant has retired and thus may no longer be considered an employee for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2). In any event, we find below that the agency may proceed to collect the money at the conclusion of the Board proceedings or seek reimbursement under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, 31 USC &#x00A7; 3701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline, however, to stay the proceedings until the agency receives reimbursement of the attorney fee amount. In order for a stay motion to be granted, there must be a showing that irreparable harm will result if the stay is not issued. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 30 MSPR 693, 695 (1986). Even assuming that a stay would be otherwise appropriate, there is no agency claim of irreparable harm. There are other means of enforcing reimbursement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the event that immediate reimbursement does not occur, the Board has the authority to enforce compliance at the conclusion of Board proceedings on the appeal. If the appellant prevails, the amount due may be deducted from any back pay or attorney fee award. In any event, the agency may seek reimbursement under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, 31 USC &#x00A7; 3701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> In this connection, we note that the agency indicated below that it has already initiated appropriate action to recoup from the appellant unauthorized moneys paid from the date of his demotion until the date of his retirement on May 10, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant is ORDERED to reimburse the agency in the amount of $5,000 for attorney fees received.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an agency demonstrated an appellant's breach of an agreement, resulting in rescission of the agreement and restoration of the appeal from a suspension, the Board directed the appellant to repay to the agency counsel fees paid under the settlement and back pay the appellant received under the settlement, <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-13-0338-C-2 (NP 11/3/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is accepted law that the Board has the authority to order an appellant to reimburse the agency for amounts paid pursuant to a settlement agreement when the agreement is rescinded. <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 124, 128 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Wisdom v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 652, 656 (1998). It is the Board's practice in cases such as this one to vacate the settlement agreement, order the appellant to reimburse the agency for amounts received under the agreement effective upon issuance of the order, reinstate the underlying appeal, <span class="Italic">not</span> stay adjudication of the appeal while the appellant <span id="Page_4852"></span>completes reimbursement, and resolve any outstanding issues with the appellant's reimbursement in a compliance proceeding at the conclusion of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Cunningham v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 21 (2009); <span class="Italic">see also Powell v. Department of Commerce</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 15 (2005)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson v. NASA</span>, 68 MSPR 135, 138 (1995), implied that an offer by the appellant to repay to the agency what he received through settlement may be a condition to the appellant's demand that a breached settlement be rescinded. The Board moved past implication in <span class="Italic">King-Roberts v. USPS,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/KING_ROBERTS_LINDA_D_AT_0752_95_1095_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199719.pdf">79 MSPR 464</a>, 472 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">King-Roberts v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3370), <span class="Italic">post</span>, and determined, over the dissent of Member Slavet, that the appellant must refund funds received from the agency through settlement before the appellant, having demonstrating the right to rescind an agreement for material breach, may continue prosecution of her appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As found above, the agency materially breached the settlement agreement. As the non-breaching party, the appellant has the option of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement or rescinding the settlement agreement and reinstating her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Fuller</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States Postal Service,</span> 45 MSPR 611, 614 (1990). The appellant has requested that, if the Board finds a material breach, it rescind the settlement agreement and reinstate the appeal. A settlement agreement cannot be rescinded unless all parties are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 135, 136 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir.) (Table); <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 MSPR 124, 127-28 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 MSPR 652 (1998). Therefore, in order to rescind the settlement agreement and to reinstate her appeal, the appellant must first return all money she received as a result of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 68 MSPR at 138. Given that rescission will require the appellant to repay the money she received, the administrative judge should provide her with the opportunity to choose either to rescind the agreement, which involves the aforementioned repayment, or to accept enforcement of the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review in court (in a decision treating the Board's ruling as an immediately appealable collateral order), the settlement agreement was construed against the agency. The agency, as the drafter of the agreement, should have put a tender-back provision into the agreement if that was what it desired, <span class="Italic">King-Roberts v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3370):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule under common law, "[w]herever a contract is breached[,]...the injured party has the right to sue for damages for the breach or it may rescind the contract; but...[it] cannot rescind until [it has] put the defendant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, or at least have offered to do so." <span class="Italic">Aktieselskabet Damgskibsselskabet Svenborg</span> <span class="Italic">v. United States</span>, 131 Ct. Cl. 399, 406 (1955); <span class="Italic">see also First Nat'l S.S. Co</span>. <span class="Italic">v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 106 Ct. Cl. 601, 621 (1946) ("Where a compromise payment has been made, and the payee seeks to rescind the compromise agreement, he must in suit tender return of the payment."). Common law does not control here, however, because the explicit language of paragraph 7 governs the rescission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting a contract, "[w]e begin with the plain language." <span class="Italic">McAbee Constr.</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc. v. United States</span>, 97 F.3d 1431, 1435 (Fed. Cir. 1996). If terms are "susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation," then they are ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "An ambiguity may be patent or latent. A patent ambiguity is one that is so glaring as to raise a duty to inquire. A latent ambiguity, on the other hand, is not glaring, substantial, or patently obvious." <span class="Italic">Massie</span>, 166 F.3d at 1189 (quotations, citation, and emphasis omitted). "Where such a latent ambiguity exists, the court will construe the ambiguous term against the drafter of the contract when the nondraftees interpretation is reasonable." <span class="Italic">Hills Materials Co. v. Rice</span>, 982 F.2d 514, 516 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 7 of the Agreement fails to specify whether King-Roberts must tender back the consideration--$50,000--prior to the rescission. The government's interpretation that the Agreement requires this tendering back is reasonable because it is consistent with the general common law rule discussed above. However, "in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation." <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.</span>, 522 U.S. 422, 426 (1998). "The merger of law and equity and modern procedural reforms have made this distinction undesirable, and the rule stated in [the Restatement (Second) of Contracts] reflects the increasing criticism of the rule at law. If the court has the power to assure the required return in connection with the relief that it grants, it is not necessary that there have been a prior return or offer to return." 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 384 cmt. b (1979). Therefore, King-Roberts' interpretation that she may delay returning the consideration is also reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because this ambiguity is neither glaring, substantial, nor patently obvious, we must construe the Agreement against the drafter, which is the agency. Accordingly, if King-Roberts opts to rescind the Agreement, she may wait until the conclusion of the proceedings to repay the $50,000. If she prevails, the amount due may be deducted from her award.</p>

Because on the particular facts of this case the Board's decision is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we <span class="Italic">affirm.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 30, 1998, Petitioner filed his initial appeal to the Board, appealing his January 1998 removal from his position with the Agency for unsatisfactory performance. On June 23, 1998, Petitioner and the Agency entered into a settlement agreement whereby the Agency would give Petitioner priority consideration for certain positions in Germany for one year and pay Petitioner a lump sum of approximately $15,000 and $2,500 in attorney fees in exchange for Petitioner's settlement of his Board appeal and waiver of any right to judicial or administrative review of the removal. On June 26, 1998, the Board dismissed the appeal pursuant to the parties' settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner filed a petition for review of the dismissal of his appeal, which the Board denied. The Board, however, forwarded to the administrative judge Petitioner's allegations that the Agency had not complied with the settlement agreement and instructed the administrative judge to treat the allegations as a petition for enforcement. After a series of rulings by the administrative judge and the Board on the sufficiency of evidence establishing a breach of the settlement agreement by the Agency, the Agency submitted evidence and argument showing that it had mistakenly deleted Petitioner's name from the Agency's "priority consideration database," thereby denying him the consideration to which he was entitled under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 22, 2000, the administrative judge conducted a teleconference with Petitioner and the Agency, during which Petitioner was advised that he had the choice between setting aside the agreement and reinstating his appeal, or enforcing the agreement. Petitioner was advised that, should he choose to reinstate his appeal, he would be required to return all of the money he received pursuant to the settlement agreement. After a series of teleconferences between the administrative judge and the parties, Petitioner informed the administrative judge, by written submission dated August 22, 2000, that he wanted to rescind the settlement agreement and reinstate his appeal, but that he could not pay back the money he received due to his insolvency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 15, 2000, the administrative judge issued a Recommendation declining to rescind the settlement agreement because Petitioner would not pay back the money received pursuant to that agreement, and recommending that the Agency fully comply, <span class="Italic">nunc pro tunc</span>, with terms of the settlement agreement by giving Petitioner priority consideration for a 1-year period beginning October 1, 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 13, 2000, Petitioner filed a "Request for Review" with the Board, arguing that the administrative judge erred in refusing to rescind the settlement agreement. On August 22, 2003, the Board issued its Final Order, finding no error in the administrative judge's determination that the settlement agreement could not be rescinded without the repayment of money received pursuant to the agreement.[1] The Board also found that the Agency had submitted documents showing that it fully complied with the administrative judge's September 15, 2000 Recommendation. Accordingly, the Board dismissed Petitioner's petition. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We were not told why the Board had the Request under consideration for nearly three years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to this court, Petitioner argues that the Board decision refusing to reinstate his appeal without his <span class="Italic">first</span> repaying the money received pursuant to the settlement agreement was arbitrary and capricious <span id="Page_4853"></span>because, according to Petitioner, there is no absolute requirement under Board case law or the common law that all money must be repaid <span class="Italic">prior to</span> rescission of a settlement agreement. On the contrary, the government argues, Board case law and general common law principles do indeed require that the money be repaid <span class="Italic">prior to</span> rescission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Board and the government are correct that, at common law, "[w]herever a contract is breached[,]...the injured party has the right to sue for damages for the breach or it may rescind the contract; but...[it] cannot rescind until [it has] put the defendant in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, or at least have offered to do so." <span class="Italic">Aktieselskabet Dampskibsselskabet Svendborg v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 131 Ct. Cl. 399, 406, 130 F. Supp. 363 (1955); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">First Nat'l S.S. Co. v. United States,</span> 106 Ct. Cl. 601, 621 (1946) ("Where a compromise payment has been made, and the payee seeks to rescind the compromise agreement, he must in suit tender return of the payment."). However, "in equity, a person suing to rescind a contract, as a rule, is not required to restore the consideration at the very outset of the litigation." <span class="Italic">Oubre v. Entergy Operations, Inc.,</span> 522 U.S. 422, 426, 118 S. Ct. 838, 139 L. Ed.2d 849 (1998). The Restatement of Contracts notes that "[t]he merger of law and equity and modern procedural reforms have made this distinction undesirable, and the rule stated in [the Restatement (Second) of Contracts] reflects the increasing criticism of the rule at law. If the court has the power to assure the required return in connection with any relief that it grants, it is not necessary that there have been a prior return or offer to return." 3 Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 384 cmt. b (1979). And, contrary to the opinion of the administrative judge, the Board has so held in prior cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 124, 128 (1994) (declining to stay the proceedings after rescission of the settlement agreement until the Agency received reimbursement on grounds that the government had shown no irreparable harm, and noting that "[i]n the event that immediate reimbursement does not occur, the Board has the authority to enforce compliance at the conclusion of Board proceedings on the appeal" and that "[i]f the appellant prevails, the amount due may be deducted from any back pay or attorney fee award"), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds,</span> <span class="Italic">Wisdom v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 652 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the Agency believes that Petitioner would be unable to repay in the event the Petitioner loses his reinstated appeal, the Agency ordinarily should seek to stay the proceeding and adduce evidence of irreparable harm. Furthermore, we ordinarily would decline to rule on the Agency's arguments on appeal concerning irreparable harm in the first instance. But here, given Petitioner's unequivocal statement of insolvency and resulting total inability to repay, the Agency does not bear any burden of proving irreparable harm. Irreparability is self-evident. If Petitioner loses his reinstated appeal, he admits no repayment can occur. Nor could the Board subtract the repayment amount from its award of back pay or attorney fees per <span class="Italic">Stipp,</span> should Petitioner prevail but be awarded less than he has already been paid. In the words of the Restatement, the tribunal lacks "the power to assure the required return" because Petitioner lacks any source for repayment, and the Board lacks the authority to compel repayment through contempt powers or award damages to the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because on this record the decision of the Board is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or otherwise reversibly erroneous, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement calling for return of benefits received as a condition of compliance litigation is to be enforced, the provisions will need to be clear. <span class="Italic">Bables v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 171, 174 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), involved the provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant agrees that she will not sue with respect to a dispute arising from interpretation or implementation of this Agreement before exhausting formal administrative remedies. The appellant agrees that before she litigates any dispute arising from the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement, she MUST repay the Agency the twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) she received under this Agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bables</span> concluded that the provision was sufficiently ambiguous to be unenforceable as a condition of enforcement litigation, as opposed to a lawsuit, to enforce the settlement, 86 MSPR at 176 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By its terms, the provision blocks the appellant's right to "sue with respect to a dispute arising from interpretation or implementation of this Agreement before exhausting formal administrative remedies." Further, she agreed to repay the cash payment she received before she "litigates any dispute arising from the interpretation or implementation of this Agreement." Thus, the paragraph which sets the bar the agency wishes to enforce itself clearly distinguishes between the appellant's right to sue and her need to exhaust administrative remedies, and requires repayment only before litigating the issue. The Board is an administrative agency, not a court, and its petition for enforcement process is clearly one of the "administrative remedies" the parties contemplated in entering the agreement into the record....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the contrary, "sue" and "litigates" are both words associated with the bringing of a lawsuit. <span class="Italic">See Black's Law Dictionary</span> 944, 1446 (7th ed. 1999), defining "litigation" as "[t]he process of carrying on a lawsuit" or "[a] lawsuit itself" (noting that "litigate" is the verb form of that word) and "sue" as "[t]o institute a lawsuit against." Under these circumstances, and considering particularly that the allegedly preclusive words are found within the same provision that distinguishes "formal administrative remedies," we find that the terms of &#x00B6; 8 appear to bar the appellant only from bringing suit before repaying the awards she has received, but not from prosecuting the current petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-029.html#sec16-30">Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act,</a>" and the discussion there of <span class="Italic">Ziegler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 116 MSPR 514, 2011 MSPB 66 (2011), precluding a tender back as a condition to the challenge of the validity of an OWBPA waiver.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement restored the appellant to agency employment and is then set aside, e.g., for mutual mistake, the agency has restored the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> by removing the appellant from the position obtained through the settlement. This removal may then lead to a separate appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Townsel v. TVA</span>, 36 MSPR 356, 358 n.2 (1988).</p>
