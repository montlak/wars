<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-38"><span class="space">2.</span> Timing of PFR</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><a href="0100-2023-12-001.html#sec5-1">Chapter 5</a> of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> should be consulted for the Board's regulations and caselaw governing the timing of petitions for review of initial decisions. Settlements that are incorporated into an initial decision for purposes of enforcement pose a special case for application of those regulations. Under the Board's approach to settlements, challenges to the underlying validity of a settlement are raised through a petition for review, governed by 5 CFR 1201.114, while the failure of one party to adhere to the terms of an otherwise valid agreement is to be addressed through an enforcement petition, governed by 5 CFR 1201.182, discussed below. Under 5 CFR 1201.114(e) (2022), the time for filing a PFR is "35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision or, if the petitioner shows that the initial decision was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the date the petitioner received the initial decision....If the petitioner is represented, the 30-day time period begins to run upon receipt of the initial decision by either the representative or the petitioner, whichever comes first."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Implied in Board decisions is a rule of reason: One files a PFR challenging the validity of a settlement when one knows that there is reason to question its validity--the regulatory deadline for a PFR is then extended, if need be, for good cause, the good cause being the discovery of the basis for invalidity of the agreement beyond the PFR deadline. When does a party know that an agreement is invalid? It depends on the reason for the claimed invalidity. Some reasons may be know very soon after the agreement is signed, e.g., coercion or lack of authority of the person signing the agreement (e.g., an unauthorized union official). Some reasons may not be known until much later, e.g., events may reveal that the parties were operating under a mutual mistake as to a material provision of the agreement, e.g., they assumed that a pay rate set by the agreement was lawful when, after the pay provisions were audited by an agency financial office it was determined that the pay rate was unlawful. The PFR would be filed after one has knowledge of the basis for the PFR. [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-24-102.html#sec17-98">Challenge to Settlement</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-12-178.html#sec5-177">Problem with Settlement</a>"; refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-050.html#sec16-51">Fraud; Misrepresentation; Bad Faith; Merit of the Underlying Action</a>," and to "<a href="0100-2023-23-138.html#sec16-136">Time for Initiating Enforcement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A decision involving a question of whether a settlement agreement was really formed, characterized by the Board as a case of possible mutual mistake, illustrates the analysis of timing of a PFR, <span class="Italic">Linares-Rosado v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 599, 603-05 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2009 MSPB 219 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An attack on the validity of a settlement agreement must be in the form of a PFR of the ID dismissing the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 10 (2009). A PFR must be filed within 35 days after the date the ID was issued, or, if the appellant received the ID more than 5 days after it was issued, within 30 days after the date that he received the ID. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). Given that the IDs were issued on September 29, 2008, but the appellant's PFR was not filed until June 24, 2009, the PFR is untimely by over 7 months.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for a late PFR, the appellant must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances of his case. <span class="Italic">See Stempihar v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 4 (2007). In assessing good cause for a late filing, the Board considers the length of the delay, the reasonableness of the excuse, the showing of due diligence, whether the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether the appellant has shown circumstances beyond his control or an unavoidable causality that impaired his ability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">See Moorman v. Department of the Army,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). If an ID dismisses an appeal as settled, newly discovered evidence that shows the settlement agreement is invalid can establish good cause for an untimely PFR. <span class="Italic">Graves v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 11 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, in cases such as this, the question of good cause and the underlying issue of the validity of the settlement agreement largely overlap. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 11. A settlement agreement is a contract between the parties, and may only be voided in limited circumstances, such as fraud, coercion, or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 691, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). In addition, events occurring after the purported settlement of an appeal can cast doubt on the settlement's validity. <span class="Italic">See Hazelton v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 357, &#x00B6; 11 (2009); <span class="Italic">DeLoach v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). Further, a settlement agreement, as a contract, may be modified by the parties after it is executed. <span class="Italic">Rothwell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 473, 477 (1994). Here, the appellant has presented sufficient new evidence regarding whether a settlement agreement was ever reached to both excuse his late filing and support a request to reopen and reinstate his appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has presented evidence of a letter that he sent to the agency disputing provisions of the purported settlement agreement on September 22, 2008, the day before the agency filed the agreement with the AJ. This contemporaneous document contradicting the contents of the purported settlement casts doubt on the existence of a settlement agreement because it suggests that there was no meeting of the minds. <span class="Italic">See Gill v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 541, &#x00B6; 4 (2000). Thereafter, the appellant and the agency disputed the purported settlement's content and the handling of the appellant's medical information. Here, in the course of their ongoing negotiations, the agency offered the appellant the option of voiding the settlement in its entirety, and he accepted that option. On June 11, 2009, the agency and the appellant agreed that the settlement agreement was void in its entirety, and that the appellant's EEO counseling would begin again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties' subsequent agreement to deem the settlement "void" constitutes new evidence regarding whether a settlement ever existed and good cause for the delay in filing the PFR. <span class="Italic">See Panther v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 419, 422 (1992) (a showing of circumstances casting doubt on the existence of a valid settlement agreement may form the basis for reopening a closed appeal without regard to time limits for filing a PFR); <span class="Italic">cf. Redschlag v. Department of the Army,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 589, &#x00B6; 99 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the appellant cannot reassert previously settled claims because he has not established that the settlement is invalid or no longer in existence). The parties' agreement also resolves the question of whether a valid settlement agreement exists. <span class="Italic">See generally Brown,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 9 (even if the invalidity of the settlement is not apparent at the time of settlement, it must be set aside if it is subsequently shown to be tainted with invalidity); <span class="Italic">see also DeLoach,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 485, &#x00B6; 11 (events occurring after the purported settlement can be probative of its validity); <span class="Italic">Rothwell,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. at 477 (parties may agree to modify a settlement after it is executed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other circumstances in which an appellant has cast doubt on whether a settlement agreement ever existed or revoked a settlement agreement, the Board has reopened or remanded the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Brown,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 10 (remand was appropriate based upon the appellant's unrebutted allegations that the settlement was a forgery or otherwise invalid because there was no meeting of the minds); <span class="Italic">Jarosz v. Department of Air Force,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (it was appropriate to reopen and reinstate the appellant's appeal after he revoked the settlement agreement under the <span id="Page_4798"></span>agreement's revocation provision); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 4 (1999) (remand was appropriate given there was insufficient evidence that a settlement had ever been reached); <span class="Italic">Reinert v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 60, 64-65 (1997) (the Board reopened a prior appeal as the parties' contractually agreed remedy for the agency's breach); <span class="Italic">see also Cruz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 450, &#x00B6; 4 (2005) (the Board reopened the action to allow the parties to enter an agreed upon modification to their settlement into the record); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Navy,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 600, 601 (1989) (agency agreed to reopen the appeal and the parties entered into a new settlement agreement). Thus, the proper course is to reopen and reinstate the appellant's appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gilmore v. OPM,</span> CH-831M-10-0005-I-1 (NP 5/18/2011), provides another example of a delayed PFR accepted by the Board when the appellant acted within a reasonable time of learning from the agency's actions that the settlement was potentially void for lack of mutuality of agreement on the terms of a draft agreement that the AJ accepted to resolve the case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Clerk's order, the appellant filed a motion arguing that his petition for review was late because he had been waiting for OPM's representative to provide him with the disability letter but that OPM refused to do so; the appellant asserted this was in violation of OPM's promise to the appellant and the administrative judge. The appellant claimed he had called OPM's representative four times and when he finally "got him on the phone," OPM refused to provide the promised disability letter. OPM filed a response in opposition to the appellant's petition for review and sought its dismissal as untimely. OPM has failed to respond in any way to the appellant's claim that its representative promised to provide the disability letter as part of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has established good cause for his untimely petition for review</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision, or, if the appellant received the initial decision more than 5 days after it was issued, within 30 days after the date he received the initial decision. <span class="Italic">McCoy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 5 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 360 F. App'x 132 (Fed. Cir. 2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). The Board will waive the filing deadline only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">Treacy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 9 (2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(f). To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits, or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 4 (2010); <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Newly discovered evidence that a settlement agreement is invalid for reasons such as fraud or mutual mistake can establish good cause for an untimely petition for review, and in such cases the issues of timeliness and the validity of the agreement may involve similar evidence and allegations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Linares-Rosado v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2009). However, the Board should not conflate whether the appellant will prevail on the merits in challenging the validity of the settlement agreement with the issue of whether the appellant has established good cause for his late petition. <span class="Italic">See Armstrong v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 591 F.3d 1358, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Instead, if an appellant is duly diligent in filing his petition for review after discovering the potential invalidity of a settlement agreement, the Board should waive its timeliness requirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has made uncontradicted allegations that his petition for review was untimely filed because he was waiting for OPM's representative to send the disability letter as he had promised the appellant and the administrative judge. He specifically alleges without contradiction that he called OPM's representative four times and when he finally reached him, the representative refused to provide the disability letter. The appellant further alleges that he then realized the settlement should be "thrown out." The appellant claims he filed his petition for review shortly after learning of OPM's alleged refusal to provide the disability letter, and this was less than 1 month after the filing deadline for his petition for review. Under the specific circumstances of this case, we conclude that the appellant exercised due diligence after learning that his settlement agreement may be invalid. We therefore conclude he has established good cause for his late-filed petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that the settlement agreement may be invalid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant essentially alleges that his settlement agreement with OPM is invalid. An attack on the validity of a settlement agreement is correctly brought as a petition for review of the initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">Linares-Rosado</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 6. The party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating the agreement. <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Generally, an appellant may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement on the bases that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or based upon fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Department of Education</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 8 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant has presented more than bare allegations in support of his claim of invalidity of the settlement agreement. The record includes documentation relating to his real estate tax authorities and a prior letter provided by OPM regarding his disability, a letter the appellant apparently finds inadequate. Further, the appellant's offer of settlement, which post-dated OPM's draft settlement agreement, included his demand for the disability letter. This suggests that the disability letter may have remained a topic of negotiation after OPM drafted the proposed settlement. As noted above, OPM has not even attempted to contradict any of the appellant's factual allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these particular circumstances, we find that the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations that the settlement agreement is invalid. He is therefore entitled to a hearing, should he request one, to determine whether the settlement agreement should be set aside as invalid. <span class="Italic">See Hazelton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 357, &#x00B6; 13 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-16-0479-I-1 (NP 10/28/2022) (dispute over receipt of benefits under an unfiled agreement: because the agreement was not filed, the AJ could not adjudicate an enforcement petition; appellant was left with filing a PFR to challenged the validity of the agreement (misleading statements by the agency), with the necessity to show good cause for a late PFR); <span class="Italic">Droze v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SE-0752-01-0205-C-1 (NP 5/10/2016) ("Even if the invalidity is not apparent at the time of settlement, the settlement agreement must be set aside if it is subsequently shown by preponderant evidence that the agreement is invalid. <span class="Italic">Wofford</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 6. However, once an appellant discovers evidence that he claims establishes a valid reason to set aside the agreement, he must act with due diligence to file a petition for review with the Board or his petition for review will be dismissed as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 438 F. App'x 903 (Fed. Cir. 2011).").</p>
