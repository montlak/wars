<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-74"><span class="space">4.</span> Doctrine of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Functus Officio</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Interspersed among FLRA's rulings concerning the timeliness of exceptions are various references to situations involving <span class="Italic">de facto</span> extensions of the period for filing exceptions when an arbitrator reconsiders and modifies a prior award. One doctrine occasionally invoked is <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>: "[O]nce an official has fulfilled the function or accomplished the designated purpose of his or her office, the official has no further authority." <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216 and EEOC, Philadelphia Dist. Office</span>, 50 FLRA 48, 50 n.2 (1994). With exceptions, arbitrators exceed their authority when, on their own, they reopen and reverse their previous awards. "The underlying principle is that once arbitrators have issued their awards, they are <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2172 and DOD, DCA</span>, 57 FLRA 625, 627 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator's charter is not at an end if he retains jurisdiction of a matter after making an award. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 65 FLRA 950, 954 (2011), concluded that an arbitrator properly retained jurisdiction to resolve issues of interpretation or implementation of a remedy following an interim award involving a dispute over a union information request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator was precluded from issuing a final award because the Arbitrator was <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>. Under the principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator has resolved the matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator is without further authority. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., </span>64 FLRA 574, 576 (2010) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA 625, 627 (2001). Unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction after issuance of the award, the arbitrator has no authority to take any further action without the joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 576<span class="Italic">. </span>However, where an arbitrator expressly retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes over interpretation or implementation of a remedy, the arbitrator may issue a supplemental award resolving such disputes. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1156 &#x0026; Laborers Int'l Union, Local 1170</span>, 57 FLRA 602, 603 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator's interim award directed the parties to explore alternative means for providing the requested information to the Union and the Arbitrator specifically retained jurisdiction to resolve any disputes over the implementation of this remedy. Furthermore, the Agency provides no authority to support its allegation that the interim award became final because the Agency issued the Arbitrator a check.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator expressly retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes over the implementation of her remedy, she was not <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>. Therefore, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to vacate an award that reserved to the arbitrator, who directed a rerun of a selection procedure, the authority to determine if there was discrimination in the original or the rerun selection process, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Oak Ridge Office and OPEIU Local 2001,</span> 64 FLRA 535, 538-39 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators may retain jurisdiction of a case for the purpose of "overseeing the implementation of remedies[.]" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Admin., Med. Ctr., Leavenworth, Kan.</span>, 38 FLRA 232, 238-39 (1990)<span class="Italic">. </span>Thus, an arbitrator may properly consider disputes arising out of the manner in which an awarded remedy is carried out. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md</span>., 56 FLRA 848, 852 (2000) <span class="Italic">(Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.). </span>For example, the Authority has held that an arbitrator properly retained jurisdiction over a disputed promotion that arose out of a process directed by the arbitrator in an earlier award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 852. By contrast, the Authority has found that retention of jurisdiction was improper when an arbitrator claimed broad jurisdiction over "further actions of the parties regarding official time proposals, agreements or unilateral decisions as well as rulings by the FLRA." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 61 FLRA 725, 726 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After resolving the statutory issue, the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction to address "any dispute arising out of or relating to the implementation of this award...[and] any renewed discrimination claims." By retaining jurisdiction over the implementation of the award, the Arbitrator has established a proper basis for considering issues arising out of the manner in which the selection process is carried out, including claims that the Agency discriminated against the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Naval Surface Warfare Ctr</span>., 56 FLRA at 852. Further, the issue of whether the Agency discriminated against the grievant in the selection process was submitted to the Arbitrator and has the possibility of being a "live" claim at a later time. Therefore, the Arbitrator properly limited his retained jurisdiction to the implementation of the specific remedy that he ordered and an issue that was originally before him. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2923</span>, 61 FLRA at 727.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In retaining jurisdiction of the potential discrimination claim, the Arbitrator stated that he would consider evidence of discrimination from both the original and rerun selection processes if the discrimination issue arises again. The Authority has held that <span class="Italic">an arbitrator did not exceed her authority when she </span>considered performance appraisals made after a grievant's non-selection in her determination of whether the grievant was discriminated against in the selection process. <span class="Italic">U.S. Gov't Printing Office, Wash., D.C.</span>, 62 FLRA 419, 426 (2008). Consistent with this precedent, there is no basis for finding that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by stating that he may consider evidence developed in the rerun selection process to determine whether the grievant was discriminated against in the original process.</p>
<p class="noindent">Where an arbitrator retains jurisdiction to resolve disputes over interpretation or implementation of an award, the arbitrator may issue a supplemental award resolving the disputes without a joint request from the parties. When the agreement permits an arbitrator to conduct further proceedings, the <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> doctrine does not preclude the arbitrator from issuing a supplemental award. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and UPTO</span>, 60 FLRA 595, 596 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ashland and AFGE Local 1286</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-73.html">73 FLRA 376</a> (2022) (retained jurisdiction to resolve any issues regarding implementation of the remedy allowed arbitrator to rule on a bypass issue relating to the remedy directed in the merits award; that the union could have filed a ULP on the bypass did not require the union to do so); <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 70 FLRA 57, 61 (2016) ("[U]nless an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction or received permission from the parties, the arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when reopening and reconsidering an original award that has become final and binding.

<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the initial award plainly states that the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction for purposes of compliance with the remedy he ordered. The Arbitrator found that wage grade employees in the bargaining unit were entitled to EDP for exposure to airborne asbestos....&#8197;That finding constituted a final resolution of the issue before him. However, the Arbitrator was unable to determine at the time of the initial award the exact amount of EDP to which each wage grade employee was entitled. Consequently, the Arbitrator left responsibility for making the determination to each individual employee's entitlement to the Activity, subject to the Arbitrator's retained jurisdiction. [T]he Activity did not file exceptions to the Arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction for that purpose. Consequently, as the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction in his initial award only for the purpose of resolving questions which might arise concerning implementation of that award, the Activity has not established that the Arbitrator was <span class="Italic">functus</span> <span class="Italic">officio</span> when he issued his supplemental award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Activity has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's supplemental award is deficient on the basis that the Arbitrator improperly retained jurisdiction over future compliance with the initial award and over the Union's future requests relating to the allocation of costs of the arbitration proceedings. The retention of jurisdiction for consideration of a possible Union request for allocation of arbitration costs is similar to retention of jurisdiction to consider requests for attorney fees. The Authority has held that arbitrators have jurisdiction to resolve questions relating to attorney fees after the issuance of a final and binding award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal Trades Council</span>, 32 FLRA 417, 421 (1988)....</p>

<p class="noindent">An example of the distinction between <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> and retained jurisdiction is provided by <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 49 FLRA 120, 122-23 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find that, following the Arbitrator's determination in his 1990 award that certain employees were entitled to full payment of transportation-related expenses, the Arbitrator was <span class="Italic">functus</span> <span class="Italic">officio</span> as to that issue. In this regard, the Authority has consistently held that, unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction after issuance of an award, the arbitrator is without legal authority to take any further action with respect to that award without the joint request of the parties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, after directing the Agency to provide the Union with information necessary to determine whether transportation expenses had been paid inconsistently, the Arbitrator stated in his 1990 award that he would retain jurisdiction so that, among other things, the parties could meet and attempt to resolve outstanding issues. It is clear that the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction in his 1990 award solely for the purpose of resolving questions which might arise concerning implementation of the award. As such, we conclude that, absent a joint request from the parties, he had no authority to reopen and reverse the 1990 award insofar as it held that employees who moved from one geographical area to another were entitled to full payment of transportation-related expenses. Consequently, we conclude further that the Arbitrator was not authorized, in his 1993 award, to deny the grievance. Insofar as the denial extended to the portion of the 1990 award encompassing transportation-related expenses for employees who moved from one geographical area to another, the 1993 award is deficient and will be set aside and that portion of the 1990 award is reinstated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Retained jurisdiction was also addressed in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 66 FLRA 300, 302-03 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction after issuance of an award, the arbitrator is without legal authority to take any further action with respect to that award without the joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 34 FLRA 1123, 1128 (1990) (finding that the arbitrator had no authority to reopen the award to determine a dispute over allocation of costs of the arbitration proceeding when he did not retain jurisdiction and both parties stipulated and agreed that they intended to place the issue before another arbitrator); <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n of Teachers AFT, AFL-CIO</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 415 (1988) (determining that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by reopening and reconsidering his original award, which had become final and binding where he did not retain jurisdiction over the matter and where there was no joint request by the parties); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">The retention of jurisdiction by arbitrators for the purposes of clarification and interpretation of an award and for overseeing the implementation of remedies is not unusual and has been approved by the Authority.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 31 FLRA 80, 93 (1988) (finding that the arbitrator properly retained jurisdiction to assist parties if they could not agree on procedures for implementing the award); <span class="Italic">Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office,</span> 15 FLRA 990, 993 (1984) (finding that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority by retaining jurisdiction to evaluate progress of bargaining). However, the Authority has held that an arbitrator must observe self-imposed limitations on his retention of authority. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Nw. Mountain Region, Renton, Wash.</span>, 64 FLRA 823, 825-26 (2010) (<span class="Italic">FAA Renton</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Dependents Sch.</span>, 49 FLRA 120, 123 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Dependents Sch.</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator, in his original award, retained "jurisdiction for [six] months to resolve any disputes if the [p]arties [were] unable to reach final agreement." In his clarification award, the Arbitrator stated that, based on his retention of jurisdiction in the original award, he could award the grievant "top-up pay."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator limited his retention of jurisdiction to six months following the issuance of his original award, he was required to abide by this self-imposed limitation on his retention of authority by asserting jurisdiction only within that time frame. <span class="Italic">See FAA Renton</span>, 64 FLRA at 826 (finding that, because the arbitrator specifically limited his retention of jurisdiction to the remedy only after deciding the merits in the initial award, the arbitrator was without authority to revisit the merits of the case in a subsequent award); <span class="Italic">Dependents Sch.</span>, 49 FLRA at 123 (noting that the arbitrator limited his authority to resolve any outstanding issues by requiring that a hearing be held on the issues not resolved by the parties and, thus, was without authority when he failed to hold a hearing); <span class="Italic">cf.

Even if the six-month period is calculated from the date of the Authority's remand, the period expired before the hearing on remand. Consequently, the Arbitrator had no authority to award the grievant "top-up" pay based on his retention of jurisdiction in the original award. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator was <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> when he relied on his retained jurisdiction in the original award to award the grievant "top-up pay" in the clarification award.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could retain jurisdiction to remedy continuing liability of an agency for environmental differential pay. The retained jurisdiction avoided a bar of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> to future, related awards of EDP. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 58 FLRA 77, 80 (2002); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1156 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Inventory Control Point</span>, 57 FLRA 602, 603 (2001) (arbitrator properly issued supplemental award clarifying EDP back pay award when arbitrator retained jurisdiction to resolve disputes over money payments).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3627</span>, 63 FLRA 274, 278-79 (2009), provides an example <span id="page_1804"></span>of an award that was complete, the arbitrator's work completed, and the impermissible subsequent modification of the remedial portion of the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio, </span>once an arbitrator has accomplished the resolution of the matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator is generally without further authority. <span class="Italic">E.g., United States Dep't of the Army Corps of Eng'rs, Northwestern Div. and Portland Dist., </span>60 FLRA 595, 596 (2005). As relevant here, an arbitrator may clarify an ambiguous award without a joint request from the parties, but the clarification must conform to the arbitrator's original award. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The question presented by the Agency's <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>exception is whether the Arbitrator's subsequent award constitutes an impermissible modification of the initial award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, in the initial award, the Arbitrator "grant[ed]...priority consideration[&#8197;] under Agreement Article 26, Section 13[.]" In determining "[t]he total number[&#8197;] of priority considerations to be granted[,]" the Arbitrator accepted the Agency's claim that a maximum of 24 priority considerations "might be allocated[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In the subsequent award, in explanation of how the 24 priority considerations would "be accomplished[,]" the Arbitrator stated, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I would assume [that] they would be "used up" only as applicable eligible employees are selected for promotion to GS-9 Paralegal....&#8197;This pattern would be continued as GS-9 Paralegal positions become available in the named offices until the [24] positions have been filled through priority considerations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 26, Section 13.A defines "priority consideration" as "the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration for noncompetitive selection given to an employee on account of previous failure to properly consider the employee for selection because of procedural, regulatory, or program violation." In the subsequent award, the Arbitrator stated that the priority considerations would continue until 24 positions "have been filled through priority considerations." In this regard, the subsequent award requires not only consideration, but also selection by noncompetitive promotion, of affected unit employees. As the Arbitrator converted 24 priority considerations into 24 promotions, we conclude that the subsequent award modifies the initial award. Consistent with this conclusion, we further conclude that the subsequent award is not authorized by Article 25, Section 5.G of the national agreement, which provides for returns by either party to arbitrators for clarification, and not for modifications. Consequently, because the subsequent award was not pursuant to a joint request of the parties, the modification was impermissible, and the subsequent award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Lawrenceburg, Tenn., </span>60 FLRA 336, 340 (2004) (Member Pope dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the subsequent award is deficient, and we set it aside. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. We further reject the Union's request for a remand to consider appropriate remedies. Although we set aside the subsequent award and strike the award of backpay from the initial award, the remedy of priority consideration for promotion remains for the violations found by the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Agriculture, Fed.</span> <span class="Italic">Grain &#x0026; Inspection Serv., Grain Inspection, Packers &#x0026; Stockyards Admin.</span>, 58 FLRA 98, 100 (2002) (remand not warranted after striking award of backpay because of additional remedy not found deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent">A subsequent award, issued during consideration of the remedial portion of the case, that reversed position on the merits of the initial award (involving a contract violation when a union representation was not permitted to be present during an on-site evaluation of the facility), was issued in violation of <span class="Italic">functus officio,</span> and the subsequent award was set aside, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA Northwest Mountain Region and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 823, 825-26 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Subsequent Award violates the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union alleges, the Arbitrator violated the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>when he reversed his final determination on the merits to find, in the Subsequent Award, that the Union did not prove that the Agency violated the CBA. Pursuant to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator resolves the matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator is generally without further authority. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA</span>, 63 FLRA 274, 278 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union has satisfactorily proven that the Arbitrator resolved the issue submitted to arbitration in his Initial Award. The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 51, &#x00A7; 1 of the CBA by refusing to allow a Union representative to serve on the evaluation team during a full-facility or follow-up evaluation. As a basis for this determination, the Arbitrator found that the Agency has "gutted Article 51 by calling everything a [s]pecial [e]valuation and then deciding they may or may not allow a union rep[resentative] to participate on the evaluation team." He then expressly affirmed the grievance and issued a Cease and Desist Order. The Agency argues that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>does not apply because the Arbitrator did not fulfill his function or accomplish the designated purpose of his office in his Initial Award. However, contrary to the Agency's argument, the Arbitrator's express affirmation of the grievance and issuance of a Cease and Desist Order indicates that the Arbitrator unambiguously and definitively resolved the issue submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's contention that the Authority dismissed its exceptions to the Arbitrator's Initial Award because a final decision had not been reached fails to demonstrate that the Arbitrator was not <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>when he rendered the Subsequent Award. As indicated previously, the <span class="Italic">portion </span>of the Initial Award resolving the merits was <span class="Italic">final</span>. Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once the Arbitrator made a complete determination on the merits in the Initial Award, he had no further authority to resolve issues concerning the merits of this case. <span class="Italic">See Dependents Schools</span>, 49 FLRA at 122-23 (arbitrator violated doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>when he reversed merits of his award even though he retained jurisdiction as to implementation of award).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as the Union notes, it was the Arbitrator who specifically limited his jurisdiction to remedy only, after deciding the merits in the Initial Award. Unless an arbitrator retains jurisdiction of an issue after rendering an award, the arbitrator has no authority to take any further action with respect to that issue absent the joint request of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Dependents Schools</span>, 49 FLRA at 122. Here, it is clear that the Arbitrator explicitly retained jurisdiction in his Initial Award solely for the purpose of resolving questions concerning the remedy. In addition, although the Arbitrator stated that the parties stipulated that the case was properly before him, he did not expressly find that the parties specifically agreed to resubmit the case for a determination on the merits. Moreover, the Agency does not contend that the parties ever requested that the Arbitrator revisit the merits of the case. Furthermore, even if the Initial Award was ambiguous, as the Agency argues, Authority precedent holds that any subsequent clarification the Arbitrator makes must conform to the original award. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 63 FLRA at 278. Consequently, the Arbitrator had no authority to reach a finding on the merits in the Subsequent Award that did not conform to his original findings in the Initial Award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The principle that an arbitrator's decision on the merits becomes final and subject to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, even when the arbitrator retains jurisdiction over some other aspect of the grievance, was first adopted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>, 49 FLRA 120. <span class="Italic">See supra </span>Part III. A. &#x0026; IV. There, in his initial award, the arbitrator sustained a grievance after making dispositive findings on the issue of transportation expenses. <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>, 49 FLRA at 120-21. He also retained jurisdiction to resolve any issues that the parties could not resolve themselves solely limited to implementation of the award. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 121. However, when the Union requested that he issue a final decision, the arbitrator dismissed the grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In considering the Union's exceptions to this decision, the Authority concluded that the arbitrator's initial ruling on the merits rendered the arbitrator "<span class="Italic">functus officio </span>as to that issue" because the arbitrator had limited his jurisdiction to the issue of implementation only. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 122. Similarly, after he decided the merits, the Arbitrator in the case before us limited his continuing jurisdiction to the issue of remedy only. Therefore, just as the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools </span>could not redetermine the merits after relinquishing his authority to do so, the Arbitrator in this case is similarly limited by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>from redetermining the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, we find that the Arbitrator was barred under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>from reversing his decision in the Subsequent Award because he had already resolved the issue. Accordingly, we remand the case to the Arbitrator to resolve the issue of remedy over which the Arbitrator specifically retained jurisdiction when he rendered his Initial Award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Notwithstanding the law just discussed, in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Marshals Serv. and AFGE Local 2272</span>, 67 FLRA 19, 22 (2012), FLRA recognized an exception to the <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> doctrine permitting a supplemental award of a remedial component (liquidated damages) of an FLSA overtime award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by violating the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>. Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator lacked the authority to award liquidated damages in the supplemental award because that award modified the initial award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator resolves the matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator is generally without further authority. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Nw. Mountain Region, Renton, Wash</span>., 64 FLRA 823, 825 (2010). The doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> prevents arbitrators from reconsidering a final award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA 625, 627 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 433 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Consistent with this principle, the Authority has found that, unless an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction or received permission from the parties, the arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when reopening and reconsidering an original award that has become final and binding. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla.</span>, 66 FLRA 300, 302 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n of Teachers AFT, AFL-CIO</span>, 32 FLRA 410, 415 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized exceptions to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, such as when an arbitrator merely clarifies an award, or corrects an award to correct clerical mistakes or obvious errors in arithmetical computation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 400</span>, 50 FLRA 525, 526 (1995). But courts <span id="page_1805"></span>have recognized an additional exception--specifically, a "completion exception," which "applies when an arbitration award fails to resolve an issue." <span class="Italic">Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehouseman &#x0026; Helpers of Am., AFL-CIO, Local 631 v. Silver State Disposal Serv., Inc.</span>, 109 F.3d 1409, 1411 (9th Cir. 1997) (quoting <span class="Italic">Courier-Citizen Co. v. Boston Electrotypers Union No. 11</span>, 702 F.2d 273, 279 (1st Cir. 1983) (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers Int'l Union v.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has not previously discussed this additional exception, there is no basis for finding that the Authority should not also recognize it, consistent with the practice of the courts. Thus, we address whether this exception applies here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found, and there is no dispute, that the Union submitted the issue of liquidated damages to her before she issued the initial award. Although the Arbitrator referenced the Union's request for liquidated damages in the initial award, she failed to resolve the issue in that award. As the Arbitrator's supplemental award of liquidated damages resolves an issue that was submitted to her before the initial award, but not resolved in that award, we find that the completion exception applies, and that the Arbitrator did not violate the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> by resolving the issue in the supplemental award. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exceeded-authority exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, FLRA allows an arbitrator to address what appears to be a continuing overtime payment violation through successive awards, addressing different periods of time, without violating the <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> doctrine, under the "completion exception" described by <span class="Italic">Dept.

<p class="noindent-1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>, once an arbitrator resolves the matter submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator is generally without further authority.[60] The doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> prevents arbitrators from reconsidering a final award.[61] Consistent with this principle, the Authority has found that, unless an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction or received permission from the parties, the arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when reopening and reconsidering an original award that has become final and binding.[62]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, federal courts and the Authority have recognized exceptions to the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>.[63] As relevant here, one exception applies where an arbitrator completes an award to resolve a submitted issue that the arbitrator's initial award failed to resolve (the completion exception).[64]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[64]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Silver State</span>, 109 F.3d at 1411 ("the arbitrator's clarification was permissible because it completed the award. The arbitrator explained that she had intended to award back[p]ay, but had failed to address that issue."); <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv</span>., 67 FLRA at 22 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievance stated that it was alleging violations three or six years "prior to the date of [the] grievance." But the remedial period set forth in the grievance contained no end date. And the issues that the Arbitrator framed in Award I--"did the Agency fail to lawfully compensate...officers...for pre-shift and post-shift overtime...pursuant to the [FLSA] and/or [FEPA]?"; and (2) if so, "what is the appropriate remedy?"--did not contain an end date for either the violations that he intended to resolve or the remedies that he intended to issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> arguments, and its reliance on Article 32(a) and (h) of the parties' agreement, are premised on the notion that the issues before the Arbitrator did not include the post-Award-I period. But the Arbitrator found to the contrary, and the Authority and the federal courts "accord an...arbitrator's formulation of the issue to be decided...the same substantial deference [that is] accorded an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective[-]bargaining agreement."[74] The Agency provides no basis for concluding that the Authority should not defer to the Arbitrator's interpretation of the issue before him as including the Agency's continuing violations of the exact same nature that were adjudicated in Award I. As such, there is no basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred in finding that--in the awards that followed Award I--he was resolving issues that were submitted to him before, but unresolved in, Award I. And--even assuming that the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> otherwise would apply here--the Arbitrator's finding supports the Arbitrator's reliance on the completion exception to that doctrine.[75]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that finding that the Arbitrator properly continued to assert jurisdiction "would be a slippery slope that could easily result in a never-ending arbitration process, the exact opposite result of the finality that the arbitration process is supposed to provide." According to the Agency, if the Union wanted to adjudicate additional violations, "it was obligated under...the parties' agreement to file a [new] grievance over the matter." If the Union had done so, the Agency claims, then the Agency "could have remedied any such violations," without having "to go through the costly arbitration process." In this regard, the Agency contends that, "[b]y improperly allowing expansion of the grievance, [the Arbitrator] has required the Agency [to] incur...significant costs"--including attorney's fees--"when it is possible [that] they did not need to be incurred."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Agency's "slippery[-]slope" argument, the Union contends that, "[h]ad the Agency ceased perpetuating the same violations during the pendency of its appeal, this matter would not have been before the [Authority]"--and that, "[o]nce the Agency eventually changed its unlawful practices on June 21, 2009, the purported 'slippery slope' stopped." Further, the Union argues that "[t]he Agency's assertion that the Arbitrator's actions resulted in unjustifiable expense to the Agency is disingenuous." In this regard, the Union argues that, when the Authority remanded the matter in <span class="Italic">Terminal Island I</span>, it directed the parties to resubmit the matter to the Arbitrator, "<span class="Italic">absent settlement</span>." According to the Union, the Agency "has made little effort to resolve any portion of this dispute."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's arguments provide no basis for finding that the Arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to resolve issues regarding the post-Award-I period, or that the Union was required to file a new, separate grievance concerning that period. As one court has stated,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">requiring the Union to invoke and exhaust the...grievance machinery once again to resolve "the remnants of a dispute [that] has already once traveled that route" would seriously undermine the federal interest in facilitating the "speedy, flexible[,] and inexpensive resolution of labor disputes."...The purpose of arbitration, and the underlying reason for the federal laws facilitating it, is to resolve disputes fairly and efficiently, not to create new ones.... The Union in this case has already once exhausted the...grievance/arbitration process on the question of remedies owed to [the officers], and [the Agency cites] no legitimate policy justification for forcing it to do so again. The reinvocation of the grievance machinery in this case would...be shamefully wasteful of resources.[96]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">So, "[o]n the basis of the formidable federal policy favoring arbitration and the efficient resolution of disputes,"[97] the Agency's arguments provide no basis for finding that the Union was required to file an entirely new grievance, rather than submitting the issues of continuing violations, and remedies for those violations, to the Arbitrator. We note that the Agency does not challenge the merits of the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency continued to commit violations in the post-Award-I period, or his determinations regarding what remedies were appropriate for those violations.</p>

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator overstepped her jurisdiction when, years after she issued an award directing backpay and other relief as to a reduction in force, the agency sought to collect an overpayment of the backpay and the arbitrator interceded to direct waiver of the overpayment. The original controversy was laid to rest through the award. The backpay was provided. The overpayment was distinct from the original controversy and not within the arbitrator's retained jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Agency for Global Media and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 70 FLRA 946, 947 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions to both awards, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority because this dispute concerns the Agency's denials of requests to waive the overpayments and has nothing whatsoever to do with the Arbitrator's retained jurisdiction from the 2011 award. Thus, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator violated the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that, after issuing an award, an arbitrator <span id="page_1806"></span>may retain jurisdiction in order to oversee remedial implementation.[10] As relevant here, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> means that, once an arbitrator has accomplished the designated purpose of his or her office, the arbitrator has no further authority.[11] Put another way, all disputes must have an end, as also must an arbitrator's jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the March award, even the Arbitrator recognized that the employees who were entitled to relief under the 2011 award <span class="Italic">had already received</span> everything needed to make them whole. In other words, the employees had received the remedy that the Arbitrator had ordered and the only purpose for which the Arbitrator had retained jurisdiction.[13] The Arbitrator awarded backpay, and the Agency paid all backpay. At that point, any retained jurisdiction came to an end.[14] Consequently, the Arbitrator violated the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> when she unilaterally reasserted jurisdiction over the Agency's decision to deny the employees' requested waivers of overpayment.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent">Before the doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> comes into play, there must be an operative award. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 33 and IRS, Phoenix Dist.</span>, 44 FLRA 252, 264 (1992), considered whether an arbitrator may withdraw, correct, and then reissue an award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We do not find that an arbitrator's purpose or function is fulfilled until the parties are in receipt of the arbitrator's award resolving the matter in dispute. Likewise, we find that there is no executed, declared decision or completed, published, and delivered award until the award is received by one of the parties. Accordingly we will not bar an arbitrator from withdrawing or rescinding an award before any party has received the award and from then substituting another award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]llowing an arbitrator to substitute another award in these circumstances better serves the Statute by preserving the integrity of the arbitral decisional process. In our view, it does not promote the purpose and policy of the Statute of facilitating the settlement of disputes to force the parties and the arbitrator to accept an award that was repudiated by the arbitrator before it was received by any of the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt this approach without regard to any reasons stated by arbitrators for withdrawing their awards; without regard to any differences between the awards; and without regard to any retention of jurisdiction....&#8197;In our view, these matters are not relevant to the power of an arbitrator to withdraw an award served on the parties, but not received by the parties. We also view the date of service of the award to be irrelevant: the critical fact is that none of the parties has received the award before it is withdrawn....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2172 and DOD, DCA</span>, 57 FLRA 625, 628 (2001), added as to the effect of a preliminary ruling concerning arbitrability, later reversed in the arbitrator's written and final award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator stated at the hearing that he found the grievance to be arbitrable and would proceed to hear evidence on the merits of the grievance. The Union has provided no support for its claim that the Arbitrator's statement constitutes his "award" for purposes of the application of the principle of <span class="Italic">functus officio. </span>In particular, the Union presented no evidence that the parties had agreed to a bifurcated procedure, with separate awards on arbitrability and the merits of the grievance. Not only is there no evidence that the Arbitrator conducted the hearing in that way, but, in his award issued to the parties, he made clear his opinion that the preferable procedure in such cases is to hear testimony and receive evidence on both issues at the same hearing. In addition, nothing in the record indicates that the Arbitrator intended his ruling on arbitrability to constitute a final award as to that matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In other words, the conduct of the hearing, to which the Union did not object, appears to contemplate that the Arbitrator would resolve all the issues in a complete award subsequent to the hearing<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic</span> <span class="Italic">Ctr., Providence Field Office, </span>4 FLRA 66, 67 (1980) (parties in process of presenting both procedural and merits aspects of dispute in single proceeding with expectation of single award and thus Authority did not consider arbitrator's ruling on procedural arbitrability)<span class="Italic">. See also Dep't of the Army, Oakland Army Base,</span> 16 FLRA 829, 830 (1984) ("the [a]rbitrator's determination of arbitrability, is merely a threshold ruling and is not a final award"). Consistent with <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 33,</span> therefore, the Arbitrator did not become <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> until after the award in this case finding the grievance nonarbitrable was received by the parties. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">Mineworkers v. Sunnyside Coal Co., </span>841 F. Supp. 382 (D. Utah 1994) (where written statement affirming grievance subsequently reversed in arbitrators full report, court held arbitrator <span class="Italic">functus officio </span>with respect to report).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the Agency should have filed an exception concerning arbitrability is based on a misunderstanding of Authority case law. The Authority has recognized that an oral bench decision can constitute a valid award. <span class="Italic">See United States Small</span> <span class="Italic">Business Admin., Washington, D.C., </span>38 FLRA 386, 403-05 (1990). However, the Authority has also held that such an award is not ripe for the filing of exceptions until it is "reduced to writing and served" on the parties<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>at 404. Moreover, if an oral bench decision is not reduced to writing and served on the parties, it can never become a final and binding award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405. Consequently, since the Arbitrator's arbitrability ruling was never reduced to writing and served on the parties, it never became subject to the filing of exceptions and could not have become a final and binding award. In this regard, at most, it functioned as an "interim" or "provisional" award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award on an arbitrability issue was but a preliminary determination and not a final award, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 103 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP Long Beach</span>, 66 FLRA 416, 417 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in the initial award, the Arbitrator found only that the grievance was arbitrable; she did not sustain, deny, or otherwise resolve the grievance. Thus, the initial award was "merely a threshold ruling and...not a final award." <span class="Italic">Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA at 628 (quoting <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 16 FLRA at 830). As such, the decisions cited by the Union, which pertain to arbitrators' <span class="Italic">final </span>awards, are inapposite. <span class="Italic">See Veterans</span>, 57 FLRA at 442 (after sustaining a grievance, arbitrator lacked authority to issue a supplemental award on issue that had not been submitted); <span class="Italic">DOD</span>, 49 FLRA at 122-23 (after resolving award on the merits, arbitrator's authority limited by scope of his retained jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">OFT</span>, 32 FLRA at 414-15 (after arbitrator denied grievance, arbitrator lacked authority to reopen and reverse the award). With respect to the Union's claim that the initial award became final when the Agency declined to file interlocutory exceptions to it, to the extent that the Union is claiming that the Agency was <span class="Italic">required </span>to file interlocutory exceptions to the initial award, no Authority precedent, including the decision cited by the Union, <span class="Italic">Local 2172</span>, 57 FLRA at 627, supports that claim. In this regard, although the Authority has held that a party <span class="Italic">may </span>file interlocutory exceptions that raise a plausible jurisdictional defect, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, 66 FLRA 282, 283-84 (2011) (<span class="Italic">BLS</span>), the Authority has not stated that a party <span class="Italic">must </span>file such exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The doctrine of <span class="Italic">functus officio</span> should be distinguished from the preclusive effect of an award in later proceedings, denominated <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. The principles of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and collateral estoppel are both based on the theory that a prior judgment on a similar issue precludes further litigation of that issue in another case. <span class="Italic">See SSA and Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals, Council 220</span>, 33 FLRA 743, 754 (1988).
