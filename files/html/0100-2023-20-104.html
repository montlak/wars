<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-100"><span class="space">h.</span> NAF Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonappropriated fund instrumentality employees are not protected by the WPA, according to <span class="Italic">Clark v. AAFES</span>, 57 MSPR 43, 44-46 (1993), analyzing the structure of the WPA and the role of OPM in regulating the civil service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary but is limited to that granted by law, rule, or regulation.... An employee may appeal certain enumerated adverse personnel actions to the Board under authority granted in 5 USC 7513(d). Under subsection (c) of 5 USC 2105, the code provision that defines "employee" for the purposes of Title 5 unless specifically modified, an employee paid from nonappropriated funds of AAFES and other entities is, with certain exceptions not here relevant, not an "employee" for the purposes of laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Navy</span>, 1 MSPR 591, 592-95 (1980), we held that the adverse action provisions of Title 5 are laws administered by OPM for the purposes of 5 USC 2105(c). Thus, we have long held that 5 USC 7513(d) does not provide nonappropriated fund (NAF) employees with a right to appeal an adverse personnel action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 596.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant conceded below that the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) also does not provide the Board with jurisdiction over his appeal. Nevertheless, he argues on petition for review that the Board has jurisdiction because he is an employee as defined in 5 USC 2105 for purposes of laws not administered by OPM and that OPM does not enforce or administer 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Thus, he contends that he is an employee under 5 USC 2302 for purposes of alleging a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and therefore has a right to file a WPA independent right of action appeal (IRA) with the Board. He argues that OSC always had the right to bring a complaint seeking corrective action for a 5 USC 2302(b)(8) violation on behalf of a NAF employee and that the WPA enables the affected NAF employee to bring a 5 USC 2302(b)(8) complaint to the Board as an IRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), an agency may not take a personnel action against any employee in reprisal for making a protected disclosure. OSC has authority to investigate allegations of personnel practices in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and to take corrective action as necessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1214. An employee may seek corrective action from the Board if OSC notifies him that its investigation is terminated or if it does not notify the employee within 120 days of the filing of his complaint that it will seek corrective action on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1214(a)(3) and 1221(a). The language of these statutory provisions makes them applicable to "employees" and does not modify the 5 USC 2105 definition of "employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant offers no support for his contention that these provisions are not laws administered by OPM and therefore are not covered by 5 USC 2105(c). OPM is the agency primarily charged with administering rules, regulations, and statutes governing the civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1103(a)(5); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. Army and Air Force Exchange Service</span>, 680 F.2d 779, 786-87 (D.C. Cir. 1982). While the Board and OSC also have particular duties regarding certain sections of Title 5, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 1212(e) and 7701(k), OPM continues to play a role in administering the civil service. We held in <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 1 MSPR at 593-94, that OPM rather than the Board has the authority to regulate with regard to employee coverage. We find nothing in the WPA itself or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to limit OPM's role to the extent that 5 USC 1221(a) and 2302 are no longer "laws administered by [OPM]" and therefore broaden the class of employees with a right to file an IRA appeal to include AAFES employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that his right to file an IRA appeal flows from OSC's authority to seek corrective action on his behalf for violations of 5 USC 2302(b)(8) is also unpersuasive. OSC determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's complaint because, under 5 USC 2105(c), NAF employees are generally excluded from the coverage of Title 5. We agree. Under 5 USC 1214(a), OSC is charged with investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices defined at 5 USC 2302(a)(2) as certain enumerated actions "with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position...." Thus, the protections of 5 USC 2302 are limited to employees or applicants for employment as defined by 5 USC 2105.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if OSC had the authority to act on behalf of the appellant, that authority would not enable the appellant to file an IRA. The individual right to appeal to the Board alleging a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(8) derives from 5 USC 1221(a), the IRA provision of the WPA, not from 5 USC 2302(b) itself. The Board has consistently held that 5 USC 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction.[1] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The appellant is not covered by the WPA because he is excluded from the definition of employee under 5 USC 2105(c).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant argues that the agency is subject to the <span id="Page_3835"></span>provisions of 5 USC 2302 because it is an agency as defined in 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C). Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant is correct, that fact does not afford the Board any jurisdiction over the appellant's claim because 5 USC 2302 does not grant jurisdiction to the Board. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that under 10 USC 1587 NAF employees are protected from reprisal for whistleblowing pursuant to procedures adopted by the Secretary of Defense. Neither the WPA nor its legislative history indicate any Congressional intention to augment this protection through application of the WPA to employees otherwise excluded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Revisiting the issue, the Board reiterated that an IRA appeal is unavailable to a NAF employee, <span class="Italic">DeGrella v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 2022 MSPB 44, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks jurisdiction over an IRA appeal filed by a NAF employee</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth below, the appellant's petition for review does not establish any error in the initial decision. However, because a significant amount of time has passed since the Board last addressed the dispositive issue presented in this appeal, we take this opportunity to explain, that despite changes to the whistleblower protection statutes, the Board still lacks jurisdiction over an IRA appeal filed by a NAF employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary but is limited to that granted by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 138, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). The appellant has the burden of establishing jurisdiction over his appeal by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(c)(1), the code provision that defines "employee" for the purposes of Title 5 unless specifically modified, an individual paid from nonappropriated funds of the various military exchanges and certain other instrumentalities of the armed forces is, with certain exceptions not relevant here, not an "employee" for the purposes of the laws administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). For example, in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Navy</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 591, 593-96 (1980), the Board held that the adverse action procedures of Title 5 are laws administered by OPM for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 2105(c) and that, therefore, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) does not provide NAF employees with a right to appeal an adverse personnel action to the Board.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;More recently, in discussing whether service with a NAF activity can be combined with other service to find that an individual has completed his probationary period, the Board confirmed that individuals working for a NAF activity do not have adverse action appeal rights pursuant to chapter 75 of Title 5. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 620, &#x00B6; 15 n.8 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal is not an adverse action appeal; however, in this case the appellant challenged the agency's action by filing an IRA appeal claiming reprisal for his whistleblowing disclosures in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). That statute prohibits, as relevant here, taking a personnel action because of any disclosure of information which the employee reasonably believes evidences gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, or an abuse of authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, the Board considered the claim of a NAF employee that his employing agency took various personnel actions against him in retaliation for his having disclosed fraud, waste, and abuse. <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 44. He asserted that the Board had jurisdiction over his IRA appeal because he claimed that OPM does not enforce or administer 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that, therefore, he was an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105 for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 45. The Board disagreed, finding that the language of the statutory provisions that allows an employee to seek corrective action from the Board by filing an IRA appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) and 1221(a), makes them applicable to "employees" and does not modify the definition of an "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105, which, as noted, excludes individuals appointed to a NAF position. <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 45. The Board further found nothing in the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989), itself or its legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to limit OPM's role of administering rules, regulations, and statutes governing the civil service to the extent that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(a) and 2302 are no longer laws administered <span class="Italic">by</span> OPM so as to broaden the class of employees who have the right to file an IRA appeal to include NAF employees. <span class="Italic">AAFES</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 45-46. In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Federal Circuit reached the same conclusion, agreeing with the Board's "well-reasoned analysis in AAFES" and finding that an employee serving in a NAF position has no right to appeal to the Board for alleged violations of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 361 F.3d at 651.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Much time has passed since the Board and Federal Circuit last opined on whether the Board has jurisdiction over a claim of reprisal for whistleblowing brought by a NAF employee. In the intervening years, Congress has made significant changes to the whistleblower protection statutory scheme, including, most notably, through the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA). Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When legislating, Congress is presumed to know an existing statute's interpretation. <span class="Italic">Parker Drilling Management Services, Ltd. v. Newton</span>, 139 S. Ct. 1881, 1890 (2019) (concluding that "Congress legislates against the backdrop of existing law"); <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 581 (1978) (stating that, when "Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the [administrative or judicial] interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute"); <span class="Italic">see Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 78-83 (1985) (finding that Congress' failure to expressly repeal the prior judicial construction of the scope of review of disability determinations creates a presumption that Congress intended to embody that construction in the amended statute); 2A Norman Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 45.12 (6th ed. 2000) (stating that, in interpreting legislative language, it may be presumed that the legislative body was aware, among other things, of existing judicial decisions). Thus, under these principles of statutory construction, in enacting the WPEA, Congress can be presumed to have known of the Board's and the Federal Circuit's respective interpretations of the existing statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress' knowledge of the Board and its reviewing court's interpretations of the WPA's provisions is specifically demonstrated by the content of the WPEA and its legislative history. The legislative history of section 101 of the WPEA specifically identified three court decisions that narrowed the scope of what constitutes a protected disclosure and explained that the statute overruled those decisions. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 4-5 (2012); <span class="Italic">see</span> WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(2)(C). By this action, Congress demonstrated that it was aware of the decisions affecting the scope of whistleblower protection and how to overturn those decisions. However, neither the WPEA itself, nor its legislative history, purports to change, or even to address, the definition of "employee" as interpreted by the Board and Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">AAFES</span> and <span class="Italic">Clark</span>. Thus, although it expanded the scope of whistleblower protection in other ways that have implications for Board jurisdiction, nothing suggests that the WPEA altered the longstanding administrative and judicial interpretations that NAF employees have no right to file an IRA appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the WPEA, other statutes have modified the whistleblower protection statutory scheme. Section 1097(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-91, 131 Stat. 1283, 1618 (2017), amended the law to provide that a disclosure should not be excluded from coverage because it was made before the individual's appointment or application for employment, addressed the scope of protection for disclosures made in the normal course of an employee's duties, and addressed the protection provided for cooperating with or disclosing information to certain investigative entities. In addition, section 5721 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, Pub. L. No. 116-92, 133 Stat. 1198, 2175 (2019), amended the law to provide protection for disclosures to Congress. The Follow the Rules Act, Pub. L. No. 115-40, 131 Stat. 861 (2017), effectively overruled a Federal Circuit decision and expanded the list of prohibited personnel practices articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). 163 Cong. Rec. H2983-01 (daily ed. May 1, 2017) (statements of Reps. Comer, Connolly, and Grothman). Similarly, section 103 of the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-73, 131 Stat. 1235, 1236 (2017), also amended the list of prohibited personnel practices. None of these statutes, however, address the definition of an "employee" for purposes of determining who can file an IRA appeal with the Board. Thus, we conclude that despite the passage of time and amendments to the statutory scheme, the holdings in <span class="Italic">AAFES</span> and <span class="Italic">Clark</span> remain valid. Thus, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1587 does not provide a right of appeal to the Board for NAF employees who claim retaliation for whistleblowing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues for the first time that the Board has jurisdiction over his IRA appeal because 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1587 protects NAF employees from retaliation for whistleblowing, and because he had recourse to OSC, exhausted his remedy with that agency, and was provided appeal rights to the Board by OSC. Under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1587(b) and (d), the Secretary of Defense is responsible for prohibiting reprisal against NAF employees for whistleblowing and for correcting any such acts of reprisal. Subsection (e) provides that the Secretary shall, after consulting with OPM, OSC, and the Board, prescribe regulations to implement the statute. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1587(e). Although the Secretary of Defense apparently has implemented the statute, nothing in the statute suggests a right to appeal to the Board.6 Thus, while reprisal for whistleblowing as described by the appellant may be unlawful under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1587, an appeal contesting the agency action is not within the Board's jurisdiction.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant suggests that because OSC informed him of Board appeal rights, the Board has jurisdiction over his IRA appeal, it is well settled that the provision of Board appeal <span id="Page_3836"></span>rights in an agency decision does not serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board when it does not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">Morales v. Social Security Administration</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 583, &#x00B6; 5 (2008); <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of the Army</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 9 (2000); <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Department of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 290, 294 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. MSPB</span>, 361 F.3d 647, 651-52 (Fed.

The <span class="Italic">Clark</span> court noted the existence of 10 USC 1587, providing protection to NAF employees against whistleblowing reprisal pursuant to procedures adopted by and subject to appeal to the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">See Clark v.
