<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-95"><span class="space">1.</span> Issue Must Be Raised With the MSPB</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit construes a waiver of arguments or claims not first raised with the Board, <span class="Italic">Conant v. OPM</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled law that appellants from an administrative agency decision may not raise claims for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">Kachanis v. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 212 F.3d 1289, 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed. Cir. 1989). As explained by the United States Supreme Court, "objections to the proceedings of an administrative agency [must] be made while it has an opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts." <span class="Italic">United States v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines</span>, 344 U.S. 33, 37, 73 S. Ct. 67, 97 L. Ed. 54 (1952). This court's standard for assessing whether an issue was adequately raised before the administrative agency is that "the issue must be raised with sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in sufficient time that the agency can do so." <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 879 F.2d at 832. Therefore, Ms. Conant's claim is reviewable by this court only if she raised the issue before the Board with sufficient specificity and clarity to make the tribunal aware of the issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, from <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 854 F.3d 1366, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Ms. Snyder's additional argument, raised for the first time <span id="Page_5314"></span>in her reply brief, that her situation fits within the definition of exception (i) from the SECDEF memorandum, pertaining to funding sources outside of the DOD-military budget. This argument was waived. It is well-established that an agency is not required to respond to arguments that were never made to the agency. For example, in <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation v. Public Citizen</span>, 541 U.S. 752 (2004), the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to an agency action on the basis that the agency "fail[ed] properly to consider possible alternatives," where the challengers "did not raise these particular objections" to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 764-65 ("Respondents have therefore forfeited any objection to the [action] on the ground that it failed adequately to discuss potential alternatives to the proposed action."). Ms. Snyder argued below only that her situation was similar in kind to those SECDEF exceptions with funding sources from outside of the government, including exceptions (e) (Foreign Military Sales) and (g) (nonappropriated funds), because furloughing her would similarly not assist DOD in reducing its budgetary shortfall....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regarding an alleged statutory infirmity in a RIF, <span class="Italic">Bacon v. DHUD</span>, 757 F.2d 265, 270-71 (Fed. Cir. 1985), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While petitioners argued to the presiding official that "any reduction in personnel ceiling...must result from Congressionally imposed budget reductions," petitioners apparently made no mention of the Act itself to the presiding official. Even if we were to conclude that the issue was raised to the presiding official, petitioners have failed to show that the issue was developed by evidence and argument to any significant extent. Accordingly, the board could reasonably conclude that the issue was newly raised. In any event, we see no purpose in a remand for the board to consider a record that is patently deficient insofar as establishing violation of the Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Potter v. VA</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1541.Opinion.2-13-2020_1532544.pdf">949 F.3d 1376</a>, 1378-79 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (following remand, Potter v. VA, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211025114">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP)), emphasized the need to object below to a ruling challenged in court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that, on appeal, Ms. Potter alleges she made additional whistleblowing disclosures that the administrative judge failed to consider, we conclude that such disclosures are not properly before us. Even if Ms. Potter could identify an error in the administrative judge's jurisdictional order limiting jurisdiction to five allegations of whistleblowing activity, the record shows that before the Board--despite having the opportunity to do so--Ms. Potter failed to challenge the jurisdictional determination on the basis of her having allegedly made additional whistleblowing disclosures. It is therefore not proper for this court to review that jurisdictional order in the first instance on appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wallace v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("[O]bjections to the proceedings of an administrative agency [must] be made while it has an opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In litigation over tax liability, <span class="Italic">Diamond v. United States</span>, 603 Fed. Appx. 947, 951 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general principle, appellate courts do not consider issues that were not clearly raised in the proceeding below. <span class="Italic">Hormel v. Helvering</span>, 312 U.S. 552, 556 (1941); <span class="Italic">see San Carlos Apache Tribe v. United States</span>, 639 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ("Because the [litigant] did not raise this argument before the Court of Federal Claims, it is waived on appeal."). "Only rarely will an appellate court entertain" a novel argument raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">Karuck Tribe v. Ammon</span>, 209 F.3d 1366, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976) ("The matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individuals case."). Because Appellants failed to raise this issue below, they have waived it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From a patent dispute, <span class="Italic">In Re: Google Technology Holdings LLC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201116271">980 F.3d 858</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum: we are, as an appellate court, charged in this instance with <span class="Italic">reviewing</span> the Board's conclusions. "The very word 'review' presupposes that a litigant's arguments have been raised and considered in the tribunal of first instance. To abandon that principle is to encourage the practice of 'sandbagging': suggesting or permitting, for strategic reasons, that the [lower tribunal] pursue a certain course, and later--if the outcome is unfavorable--claiming that the course followed was reversible error." <span class="Italic">Freytag</span>, 501 U.S. at 895 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne v. McDonough</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210728107">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) ('"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view." <span class="Italic">Cutter v. Wilkinson</span>, 544 U.S. 709, 719 (2005) (declining to decide issue not addressed in the court of appeals). To be ripe for review, Mr. Payne's merits arguments must pass through the ordinary channels of lower-tribunal review.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some, but not unlimited, leeway is given to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants, <span class="Italic">Schnell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 605 Fed. Appx. 974, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has held that "in situations where a party appeared <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before the lower court, a court of appeals may appropriately be less stringent in requiring that the issue have been raised explicitly below." <span class="Italic">Forshey v. Principi</span>, 284 F.3d 1335, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Specifically, <span class="Italic">Forshey</span> teaches "a court of appeals may require less precision in the presentation of the issue to the lower court than it demands of a litigant represented by counsel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Forshey</span> allows this court to be less stringent in requiring an issue to be presented before the Board, even under a less stringent approach, Mr. Schnell cannot now present his argument. Here, Mr. Schnell never presented to the Board or to the AJ his argument that the Agency employed the incorrect base salary because it failed to account for the Board's order to promote him to the GS-12 grade level effective October 31, 2006.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue must not only be raised before the MSPB, it must be raised before its AJ. Conversely, if an affirmative defense (reprisal) is abandoned at the hearing level, it cannot then be argued on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jimmerson v. DHUD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 90-3209). In one appeal, the issue was whether the MSPB correctly denied jurisdiction over a WIGI appeal by an employee covered by a collective bargaining contract. The issue was in doubt at the appellate level, but the principal basis for jurisdiction--an argument concerning the effect of conflicting grievance procedures in successive negotiated agreements--was not raised in response to the AJ's order to the employee to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. According to <span class="Italic">Meglio v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 1576, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unfortunate that the appellate procedure in these cases can at times appear so complex, but the board has promulgated its regulations in accordance with the law and Congress' desire to streamline and prevent duplicative efforts in processing employee complaints. Where petitioner fails to frame an issue before the presiding official and belatedly attempts to raise that same issue before the full board, and the board properly denies review of the initial decision, petitioner will not be heard for the first time on that issue in the Federal Circuit.</p>

Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 229 F.3d 1088, 1091 (Fed.

Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3393) (if an issue is raised for the first time before the Board on a PFR but not before the administrative judge, the issue will not be considered by the court); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Yahle v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 81 Fed. Appx. 350, 352 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) (if a defense of harmful error was withdrawn before the Board, it may not be reasserted before the court); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Power Analytics Corp. v.

Such a practice is essential to avoid surprising litigants on appeal with issues that were unbriefed or undeveloped before the district court, <span class="Italic">Hormel v. Helvering</span>, 312 U.S. 552, 556 (1941). It is a practice we adhere to today.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rules governing prior administrative litigation of issues applies to arbitration cases as well. If there is an objection argued to the court concerning the procedures followed by the arbitrator, that objection should first have been raised with the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rubert v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3610) (citing <span class="Italic">Gunn v. VAMC</span>, 892 F.2d 1036, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990)); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Educ., supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an opinion that provoked a dissent, the Federal Circuit again emphasized the need to raise issues before the Board before bringing them to the court. The case involved a challenge in court to the adequacy of performance standards, <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 879 F.2d 829, 832 (Fed. Cir. 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, appellate courts refuse to consider issues not raised before an administrative agency....&#8197;"[O]bjections to proceedings of an administrative agency [must] be made while it has an opportunity for correction in order to raise issues reviewable by the courts." <span class="Italic">United States v. Tucker Truck Lines</span>, 344 U.S. 33, 37 (1952)....&#8197;A corollary is that the issue must be raised with sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in sufficient time that the agency can do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ways in which Ms. Wallace claims she raised the issue did not alert the administrative judge that the issue was before him. Ms. Wallace's only explicit challenge to the validity of the performance standards was in her petition to the Board to review the second decision of the administrative judge, which the Board denied. That attempt to raise the issue came <span id="Page_5315"></span>too late, since the administrative judge had no opportunity to receive evidence on the issue or to decide it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Wallace points to three statements made by her union representative. The first stated that "5 USC 4302(b)(1) call[s] for job criteria to be 'objective,' not punitive." That statement was made not before the Board but to the Air Force in response to its notice of proposed removal. The present case is unlike the Board's <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> decision upon which the dissent relies. <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> held that because the employee had alleged in her response to the agency's notice of proposed removal that her job performance standards were invalid, the presiding official had not improperly expanded the proceedings by considering that issue. In this case, unlike <span class="Italic">Callaway</span>, Ms. Wallace did not adequately raise the performance standards issue before the administrative judge, who did not consider it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second statement was that "[i]t is also contained in Section 4302...that the employee has a right to an objective appraisal of his or her performance...." That was an isolated statement made during the EEOC hearing. The administrative judge could not fairly be expected to comb the lengthy transcript of the EEOC proceeding in order to determine whether Ms. Wallace had raised the issue....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Wallace refers to her Statement of Facts and Issues and Witness List that she submitted to the administrative judge. The only issue she set forth was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Did the Agency comply with the requirements of law and regulations, specifically 5 USC 4302 and AFR 40-452, and with case law and precedents, in their removal of Ms. Janet L. Wallace, from her position with the Air Force...or was it a personal action based on some motivation of her supervisor...?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither this statement nor the three paragraphs that followed adequately alerted the administrative judge that Ms. Wallace was challenging the validity of the performance standards for her job. The mere citation of the statute and regulations did not serve that function. The only issue this statement appeared to raise was whether Ms. Wallace was removed for unacceptable performance or because of some personal reason of her supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There have been occasional instances in which this court or its predecessor has considered issues not properly raised before an agency or remanded the case to consider them. <span class="Italic">Beard v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 801 F.2d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Fucik v. United States</span>, 228 Ct. Cl. 379 (1981); <span class="Italic">American Elec. Contracting Corp. v. United States</span>, 217 Ct. Cl. 338 (1978). We discern nothing in this case, however, that induces us to depart from the general principle and determine an issue that was not properly raised before or decided by the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Helman v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170509140">856 F.3d 920</a>, 937 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, which provides 'that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted,' is well established in the jurisprudence of administrative law. <span class="Italic">Woodford v. Ngo</span>, 548 U.S. 81, 88-89 (2006) (citing <span class="Italic">McKart v. United States</span>, 395 U.S. 185, 193 (1969); <span class="Italic">Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp</span>., 303 U.S. 41, 50-51 (1938)).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be sufficiently raised to constitute an appealable issue, the issue need only be addressed to the Board in a manner designed to attract its decisional authority. The issue need not be presented with great elaboration, <span class="Italic">Kachanis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 212 F.3d 1289, 1294 (Fed. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that Kachanis has adequately preserved the issue of statutory conflict for appeal. These contentions clearly satisfy this court's standard for raising arguments before the administrative agency. A party need only present the issue so that it is "raised with sufficient specificity and clarity that the tribunal is aware that it must decide the issue, and in sufficient time that the agency can do so." <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 879 F.2d at 832; <span class="Italic">see also Smearin v. United States</span>, 992 F.2d 1195, 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Synan v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 765 F.2d 1099, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Doyle v. United States</span>, 599 F.2d 984, 1000 (Ct. Cl. 1979). By presenting the statutory conflict issue in various filings to the administrative judge, as well as to the full Board, Kachanis afforded the Agency this opportunity. Here, both the administrative judge and the Board had the opportunity to address Kachanis's concerns, although neither did, thus alleviating any concerns we may have about premature appellate review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is sufficient to preserve an issue for appeal that the issue was raised and ruled on by an AJ at a status conference. No more is required.<span class="Italic"> McCollum v. NCUA</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1265794.html">417 F.3d 1332</a>, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2005). But mere citation of a regulation, without more, is not sufficient to preserve an issue for appeal. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. Dept. of Army</span>, 131 Fed. Appx. 725, 728 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP).
