Notwithstanding the Board's suggestions in <span class="Italic">Seas</span> and <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span>, the vast majority of the Board's cases addressing falsification--including some of its earliest case law discussing the contours of this charge--either expressly or implicitly considered whether an employee's misrepresentation was made for personal gain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lacapurcia v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Federal Circuit's articulation of the elements of falsification in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span>, and in keeping with the Board's historical approach to the elements of falsification, we MODIFY <span class="Italic">Seas</span> and <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span> to the extent that they suggest that an agency does not have to establish that an employee personally benefited or gained from his misrepresentation when assessing the elements of a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300. Accordingly, we find that in order to establish a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying, the agency must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employee "intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain."[3] <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Harrison v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 411 Fed. Appx. 312, 315 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We do not believe that the Federal Circuit intended to develop a unique set of elements for a charge of falsification based only on an allegation of fraud, and we find that the test set forth in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span> applies to instances of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying involving an employee's attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead an agency for his own private material gain. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300. We note, moreover, that the Board has historically used the terms defraud, deceive, and mislead interchangeably when discussing a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying, and there is nothing in <span class="Italic">Leatherbury</span> to suggest that the court's articulation of the elements of falsification was limited to instances of fraud. <span class="Italic">Compare Eilertson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 152, 156 (1984) (using deceive or defraud in explaining standard), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 179 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table), <span class="Italic">with Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 425 (only reciting defraud as part of standard).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making this clarification to our cases establishing the elements of a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying, we emphasize that the definition of "own private material gain" is quite broad, and that "the advantage to be secured [by the employee] is by no means limited to monetary gains arising from a falsification." <span class="Italic">See Bradley</span>, 900 F.2d at 237 n.6 (examples of gain include, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, compensation, overtime payment, per diem reimbursement, travel reimbursement, <span id="Page_2745"></span>Office of Workers' Compensation Programs compensation, and offers of employment). Thus, charges of falsification, misrepresentation, and lying have been sustained when there is evidence that the employee engaged in falsification with the intent to influence pending disciplinary proceedings, to secure employment, to use sick leave to avoid being placed on absence without leave (AWOL) or leave without pay (LWOP), and to hide or obscure facts in order to prevent the agency from taking disciplinary or corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Ahles v. Department of Justice</span>, 768 F.2d 327, 330 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (intent to influence disciplinary proceeding); <span class="Italic">see also Rigilano v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In making this clarification, we further note that, in cases where there is no evidence that an employee has engaged in falsification, misrepresentation, or lying with the intent to defraud, deceive, or mislead the agency for his own private material gain, agencies may still charge an employee with lack of candor,[4] and they may include among the proposed aggravating factors the intentional nature of an employee's misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1284 (lack of candor is a broad and flexible concept); <span class="Italic">see also Chavez v. Small Business Administration</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 6 (2014) (lack of candor does not require a showing of intent); <span class="Italic">Arena v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 125, &#x00B6; 6 (2014) (the Board will consider the nature and seriousness of misconduct when reviewing the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty, including whether the offense was intentional or frequently repeated). Alternatively, agencies may charge an employee with the substantive submission of inaccurate information or a more generic charge of conduct unbecoming, neither of which involve an element of intent, and they may include among the proposed aggravating factors the intentional nature of the appellant's conduct in leveling such charges. <span class="Italic">See Cross v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the colloquial understanding of a lack of candor might not equate to the usage of this term in federal civil service law, we believe the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span> that lack of candor is a broad and flexible concept is designed to capture all of those instances which do not otherwise meet the definition of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying. <span class="Italic">See Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1283-84 (lack of candor and falsification are different, although related, forms of misconduct, and the latter is not a necessary element of the former); <span class="Italic">see also Hoofman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the administrative judge analyzed the charge as a charge of misrepresentation or falsification, she failed to address the second component of the intent element, which requires the agency to prove that the appellant intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain. <span class="Italic">See Boo</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that to establish a charge of falsification, misrepresentation, or lying, an agency must prove that an employee intended to defraud the agency for his own private material gain).

The appellant asserted that he provided the incorrect information on the incident report because he knew that J.L. was on parole and he did not want to cause J.L. to be sent back to prison. Although it is not clear why the appellant would want to protect J.L. from returning to prison after J.L. attacked him with a hammer, the agency did not challenge the appellant's testimony to this effect on cross-examination at the hearing, or present evidence regarding any other reason that the appellant misrepresented facts in the incident report. Regardless of whether the appellant's explanation for his actions was ultimately credible, the burden of proof of the charge lies with the agency, and the agency did not present any evidence to prove the element of private material gain. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1)(ii).</p>

As noted, the administrative judge did consider the appellant's claim that he did not know how to properly request leave on the ATAAPS, but found it incredible.

USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 422, 427 (1997) ("We are unaware of any case holding that financial gain is required to prove a falsification charge"; the "absence, presence, or amount of gain, financial or otherwise, may be a factor in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty for an act of falsification."), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 78 MSPR 569, 574 (1998); <span class="Italic">Schoeffler v. USDA</span>, 47 MSPR 80, 84 (1991) (charge of falsification may be sustained on a determination that the employee intended to deceive or mislead the agency, irrespective of personal gain) (<span class="Italic">Seas</span> and <span class="Italic">Schoeffler</span> were modified to require an element of material gain by <span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 100, 2014 MSPB 86 (2014)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 174, 179 (1994) (intent necessary to support a falsification charge was not evidenced; the appellant, apparently newly assigned to a job, initialed inspection reports with the initials of another employee when the appellant was unsure if he was qualified to use his own initials).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board set aside mitigation of a removal of an individual who falsely certified that a reservist spent more time on duty than he in fact had, resulting in greater pay to the reservist, but nothing to the appellant. Although there was some evidence that the practice previously occurred, the practice was not approved by the agency, <span class="Italic">Sherwin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 44 MSPR 144, 148-49 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prove falsification of an official document, the agency must prove that the appellant possessed the specific intent to falsify and that the appellant provided the false information with the intent to deceive or mislead the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant possessed the necessary intent to falsify the pay document because he intended the document to reflect that Sergeant Williams worked the hours and days specified, even though he undoubtedly knew that the information was erroneous. Further, the appellant made the false certification with the intent to deceive or mislead the agency into believing that Sergeant Williams had actually worked the hours and days specified. Thus, the appellant intended to defraud the agency. The fact that the appellant did not realize any significant benefit from his action, while relevant to the issue of mitigation of the penalty, does not establish that the appellant lacked the necessary intent to defraud the agency. Implicit in the finding that the appellant falsified the document with the intent to deceive or mislead the agency is the finding that he intended to defraud the agency since these findings are interchangeable, and a showing of either, along with a showing that the appellant knowingly supplied the wrong information, will support a charge of falsification of government documents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, as in <span class="Italic">Sherwin</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the appellant attempts to confer an unwarranted benefit, the requisite intent to defraud may be established when the person who benefited from the incorrect information was someone other than the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McIntire v. FEMA</span>, 55 MSPR 578, 586 (1992) (timekeeping entries). It is significant, however, that the misstatement be material, that there is an intent to obtain something not otherwise available for an employee. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v. VA</span>, 900 F.2d 233 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (employee was entitled to the relocation expenses he claimed; he did not commit fraud by providing incorrect information concerning the family members who accompanied him in a relocation), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Dogar v. DOD</span>, 95 MSPR 52, 60 &#x00B6; 16 (2003) (appellant improperly claimed more than he paid for living quarters and related expenses). Of a false statement made in a performance appraisal, <span class="Italic">Cross v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 MSPR 62, 77 &#x00B6; 33 (2001), noted that the term "material" means "significant," "having some logical connection with the consequential facts," or "of such a nature that knowledge of the item would affect a person's decision-making process." If the employee is charged with instructing another employee to falsify a document, the agency must establish that the appellant's intent was to commit falsification, since the agency in essence charges the employee with committing falsification through a subordinate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 314, 318 &#x00B6; 6 (1998).</p>
