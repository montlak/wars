<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-92"><span class="space">A.</span> TIME FOR INITIATING JUDICIAL REVIEW</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7703(b)(1)(A):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review shall be filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;A petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board that raises no challenge to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) other than practices described in section 2302(b)(8), or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any petition for review shall be filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Cases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702 of this title shall be filed under section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(c)), section 15(c) of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 633a(c)), and section 16(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 216(b)), as applicable. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such case filed under any such section must be filed within 30 days after the date the individual filing the case received notice of the judicially reviewable action under such section 7702.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The petitioner (appellant) has 60 days from the date of issuance of the final order or decision of the Board (previously 30 days from receipt of a decision) to initiate a petition for review in the court of appeals. 5 USC 7703(b)(1). Procedural rules allowing several extra days after service for some appellate deadlines do not control the time for filing the judicial petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradford v. OPM</span>, 274 Fed. Appx. 879 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP). When the Board's decision contains both an issuance date and a statement that it is the final order of the Board, the finality date is the date of issuance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 536, 548 (1994). It has occurred that the Board fails to mail an initial decision to the appellant and then reissues the decision with a later effective date, effectively starting a new judicial review period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chavez v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-12-0698-R-1 (NP 12/19/2013).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time for appeal runs from issuance of the Board decision and extends to the date the required appeal papers are received in the clerk of the court's office. If the last order received from the Board is an initial decision, and there is no timely pending PFR from that initial decision with the MSPB, the period for review runs from the date of the finality of that decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McLaughlin, supra</span>. <span class="Italic">Hearn v. Dept. of Army</span>, 662 Fed. Appx. 916, 918-19 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), emphasized that the 60-day filing period runs from issuance, not receipt, of the Board decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 27, 2012, Congress limited this court's review of final decisions of the Board to those petitions "filed within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Ms. Hearn asserts that we should therefore calculate the permissible time for the filing of her petition for review based on when she actually received the Board's decision.

App. P. 26(a)(2), intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays days are excluded in computing time when the relevant time period is less than 11 days. Grayton had 60 days to file a petition for review and thus Grayton's petition for review was required to be filed within 60 calendar days, not 60 business days, in order to be timely. Furthermore, the Board's decision stated that a petition for review must be received by the court within 60 calendar days of the date of receipt [now issuance] .

Like the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Schmitt</span>, Mr. Jones filed his petition for review with this court before the AJ's Initial Decision became the Final Decision of the MSPB--i.e., he appealed too early. And like the decision under review in <span class="Italic">Schmitt</span>, the AJ's Initial Decision became the Final Decision under review on appeal. This is not a case where some claims remained pending before the MSPB, <span class="Italic">see Baiamonte v. Potter</span>, 345 Fed. Appx. 561, 562-63 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (unpublished) (dismissing prematurely-filed appeal from the United States Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals when some claims remained pending below), or where Mr. Jones sought review of the MSPB's final decision <span class="Italic">after</span> the sixty-day time limit in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(A), <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. App. P. 26(b)(2) (explaining that the court "may not <span class="Italic">extend</span> the time to file...a notice of appeal from...an order of an administrative...board...unless specifically authorized by law"). Our conclusion also finds support in the equitable principle of fair play inherent to the judiciary. <span class="Italic">Cf. McDonald v. Mabee</span>, 243 U.S. 90, 91 (1917) ("[G]reat caution should be used not to let fiction deny the fair play that can be secured only by a pretty close adhesion to fact." (Holmes, J.)

<p class="Body-Text">A delay in the Federal Circuit Clerk's receipt of a judicial petition for review was not excused when it apparently resulted from the mail being held up in an off-site location for irradiation before delivery to the court, <span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, 345 Fed. Appx. 560, 560-61 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 4, 2008, the Merit Systems Protection Board issued a final decision in <span class="Italic">Nash v. United State Postal Serv.,</span> No. CH-0752-08-0531-I-1, specifying that its decision was final and that any petition for review must be received by this court within 60 calendar days of receipt of the Board's decision. Nash states that he received the Board's decision on December 8, 2008. The court received Nash's petition for review 74 days later, on February 20, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for review of a Board decision must be filed within 60 days of receipt of the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). The 60-day filing period is "statutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Monzo v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">see also Oja v. Department of the Army,</span> 405 F.3d 1349, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("[c]ompliance with the filing deadline of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) is a prerequisite to our exercise of jurisdiction").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nash asserts that he mailed his petition for review on January 30, 2009 and thus believed it would arrive at the court within the 60-day time limit. Counsel for Nash asserts that his office contacted the clerk's office on January 30, 2009 before mailing the petition to verify what documents were required to be submitted and that the clerk's office did not inform his office that mail sent to the court is sent to an offsite location for irradiation prior to delivery to the court. Counsel for Nash asserts that this procedure delayed the filing of the petition for review and argues that mail should be deemed received when it is received in the offsite facility, rather than when it arrives at the court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nash cites a nonprecedential disposition, <span class="Italic">Apiado v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 1991 WL 237641 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 8, 1991), in which the appellant mistakenly mailed his appeal to an agency rather than the court. After the time for appealing expired, the agency forwarded the documents to this court. The court declined to rule that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, determining that the failure of the agency to timely forward the petition may have precluded the appellant's otherwise timely petition. <span class="Italic">Apiado</span> is not citable pursuant to Fed. Cir. R. 32.1, is not precedential, and is not binding on the court. In addition, to the extent that the ruling in <span class="Italic">Apiado</span> was based on the "unique circumstances" doctrine, that doctrine was squarely rejected by the United States Supreme Court in<span class="Italic"> Bowles v. Russell,</span> 551 U.S. 205, 127 S. Ct. 2360, 168 L. Ed. 2d 96 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nash also cites the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Baney v. Department of Justice,</span> 263 Fed. Appx. 892 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In <span class="Italic">Baney</span>, the petition for review was initially rejected as untimely. However, the petitioner then submitted documentation in the form of a certified mail receipt showing that a mailing to this court was delivered within the timeframe for submitting a petition for review. The court determined that the petition was deemed received on that date and thus was timely. In <span class="Italic">Baney</span>, the court determined that the petition for review was received and filed within the statutory timeframe. In this case, however, it is uncontested that the petition was received by the court beyond the 60-day limit. Thus, <span class="Italic">Baney</span> is not applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USPS contends that the Supreme Court and this court have confirmed that the timely filing of a petition for review is a jurisdictional requirement and thus this court lacks authority to waive or equitably toll the timeliness requirement. USPS contends that in <span class="Italic">Bowles</span>, the Supreme Court ruled that "the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement" and that the court has no authority to create equitable exceptions. In addition, USPS argues that this court confirmed in <span class="Italic">Oja</span> that the 60-day time period set forth in section 7703(b)(1) may not be equitably tolled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 25(a)(2), "filing is not timely unless the <span class="Italic">clerk</span> receives the papers within the time fixed for filing" (emphasis added). Thus, it is clear that the timeliness of a submission must be assessed based on the date of receipt by the clerk, not any other location. <span class="Italic">Bowles</span> and <span class="Italic">Oja</span> make clear that this court cannot waive the 60-day time limit set forth in section 7703(b)(1). Because Nash's petition for review was received by this court 14 days late, we must dismiss Nash's petition as untimely.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The court may raise jurisdiction on its own motion, and it did so, dismissing a case that was untimely filed, even though the government did not raise the issue. <span class="Italic">Alvord v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3071). Under earlier case law, the court's jurisdiction may depend on a timely appeal to the Board. A case originating prior to the Reform Act determined that the Civil Service Commission may reject appeals not timely filed, and the failure to file a timely appeal constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, precluding judicial review. <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Postmaster General</span>, 623 F.2d 594, 595 (9th Cir. 1980). But under the Reform Act, if otherwise timely, judicial review may be sought of the Board's ruling on the timeliness of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Strickland v. MSPB</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 683 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (time for judicial review of Board decision on the timeliness of a petition for review to the MSPB runs from the date the appellant receives the Board's decision finding the PFR untimely, not from the finality date of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Technical filing lapses are occasionally forgiven. The court excused a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who filed within 20 days with the MSPB rather than with the court, essentially determining that the judicial clock was stopped when the appellant filed her appeal from an arbitrator's decision with the wrong forum. <span class="Italic">Reece v. VA</span>, 862 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP) ("The Government contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over Reece's appeal from the arbitrator's decision because she failed to file her petition for review to this court within the 30-day time limit set forth by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(b)(1) (1982). For purposes of this appeal, we are not persuaded. Reece was acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span> when she filed her petition for review. That petition, filed on October 20, 1987, although filed with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) rather than this court, was submitted 20 days after the arbitrator issued his decision. Treating the filing date of Reece's petition to the MSPB as the date of filing with this court, we must conclude that Reece complied with the statutory mandate."). <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kelley v.

If an initial decision unequivocally states that an employee may not file a judicial petition for review while any Board appeal (including an untimely PFR) is pending, the appellant will not be defaulted by the reviewing court if the judicial review petition is otherwise timely filed, <span class="Italic">Howell v. MSPB</span>, 785 F.2d 282, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he presiding official's notice to a petitioner on judicial appeal rights advises that no judicial appeal may be taken while the case is pending before the MSPB. Thus, the filing before the board within the judicial appeal period must be deemed to keep the matter "pending" before the board and preclude the appeal. In effect, the period for judicial appeal is tolled while the matter is being considered by the full board. A petitioner cannot be precluded from filing and at the same time be required to file a judicial appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A timely PFR to the Board makes the initial decision non-final, but a timely appeal to the Federal Circuit is not blocked by an untimely PFR to the Board. <span class="Italic">Martin v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210910255">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP). Assuming that information from the Board concerning time limits and the effects of filing administrative and judicial petitions for review is correctly stated, once an initial decision has become final, an untimely PFR does not stop the clock from running on time [now 60, formerly 30 days] allowed for judicial review of the decision on the merits (i.e., the initial decision that became final), <span class="Italic">Olivares v. MSPB</span>, 17 F.3d 386, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The untimely submission of a petition for review and motion for an extension of time to the MSPB does not prevent the initial decision of the administrative judge from remaining the final decision of the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1) (1988). Thus, the untimely submission of a petition for review and motion for an extension of time to the MSPB does not stop the running of the 30-day statutory time limit in which to file an appeal to this court.[3] <span class="Italic">See also</span> P. Broida, A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law &#x0026; Practice 662 (10th ed. 1993) (hereinafter "Broida").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;But if the motion for an extension of time is granted and the petition for review is accepted for filing, a new 30-day period for appeal to this court begins to run after a new final decision is made by the board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113(b), (c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee's appeal is dismissed as untimely and the initial decision becomes final, should the employee then file a late PFR and receive a subsequent final decision, judicial review is directed toward the first final decision--the decision dismissing the appeal as untimely--not the subsequent final decision dismissing an untimely PFR. The employee cannot reactivate a moribund case by initiating an untimely PFR. <span class="Italic">Matusavage v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2454); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ashworth v. MSPB,</span> 190 Fed. Appx. 952, 954 (Fed.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 701 F.2d 34, 36 (5th Cir. 1983) (if the initial decision becomes final and the appellant files a late PFR, subsequent judicial review is directed to the belated PFR, not to the initial decision on the merits; the reviewing court assesses whether the Board abused its discretion in rejecting the PFR as untimely); <span class="Italic">Olivares, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once the Board denies a PFR, it may treat subsequent PFRs as requests for reopening rather than as a PFR. This treatment controls the jurisdictional ability of the court to review the earlier, final decision. <span class="Italic">Vargas v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3255). The court expanded on the concept of one final, judicially reviewable decision in <span class="Italic">Haines v. MSPB</span>, 44 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (Fed. Cir. 1995), declining to permit review of the Board's refusal to reopen a case that was previously the subject of a final, judicially reviewed, decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It may well be that the Board has a policy generally not to reopen <span class="Italic">any</span> appeal from a Board decision that has been affirmed by us, for the Clerk cited our affirmance in his letter. We see nothing unlawful in any such policy, although it may not be required by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Haines has previously received our review of the final order of the Board disposing of her appeal on June 11, 1991. While no authority prohibits her from repeatedly, indeed ad infinitum, requesting the Board to reopen her case despite our affirmance of the Board's final order, neither does any authority allow her to create another final Board order in the same appeal to support a second review by making such informal and unauthorized requests. If she could, there would be no limit to the number of appeals we could receive and would be required to decide in a single case. Having lost once and finally, including upon review by us, a disappointed petitioner could repeatedly generate further appeals to us, one for each "denial" of successive petitions to the Board for it to reopen. If the Board's declination to reopen were a final decision, an appeal to us therefrom would lie provided it were timely filed. To proceed down this road would fly in the face of the regulations, the premise of the Act, and judicial economy. We decline petitioner's invitation to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCarthy v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-3072.Opinion.1-12-2016.1.PDF">809 F.3d 1365</a>, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2016), distinguished <span class="Italic">Haines,</span> involving repetitive motions to reopen, and determined that a letter rejecting a reopening petition from the MSPB Clerk established a basis for pursuit of judicial review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reviewability of Clerk letters from the Board is not an entirely new question to us. In <span class="Italic">Haines v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 44 F.3d 998, 1000 (Fed. Cir. 1995), we found that a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> letter from the Clerk denying repetitive motions to reopen was not a "final order or final decision" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113, and thus not reviewable. We reasoned that "the letter was merely an administrative response by the Clerk to Haines's third informal letter request that the Board reopen her appeal and reconsider its final decision on its own motion. The Clerk had been delegated the authority to make such responses by the Board and was performing only a ministerial function in this regard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we need not decide the reviewability of Clerk letters generally, we conclude that, at least in the circumstances of this case, where a Clerk letter denies a first motion to reopen, <span class="Italic">Haines</span> does not apply. As we previously noted, <span class="Italic">Haines</span> appears to have involved repetitive motions to reopen. <span class="Italic">In re McCarthy</span>, No. 15-118, slip op. at 2 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 29, 2015). Because of this, the situation only required an "administrative response" which could be dispensed by a "ministerial function." <span class="Italic">Haines</span>, 44 F.3d at 1000. By contrast, McCarthy's motion to reopen had not been previously considered by the Board as it involved an intervening change in law. In effect, then, the Clerk letter announcing the Board's denial of his motion announced a substantive decision which had a real impact on McCarthy's interests. The nature of this decision is akin to a "final order or final decision," not an "administrative response," and should be construed as such. This court's jurisdiction should not turn on the manner in which the Board chooses to announce its decision, and it would elevate form over substance to hold otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's arguments to the contrary are unavailing. While it is true that existing statutes and regulations do not specifically state that a Clerk letter is a "final order or final decision," <span class="Italic">see, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(e)(1)(B), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.113, 1201.117(c), they also do not prohibit it from being so. Indeed, they are silent as to the form these documents may or may not take. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, characterizing a Clerk letter as a "final order or decision" does not conflict with existing law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we are not deprived of jurisdiction simply because the Board issued its denial of McCarthy's motion to reopen in letter form.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee seeks review of a Board decision by EEOC, but the EEOC review request is untimely, the appellant is not barred from initiating a timely request for review with the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Burks v. R.R. Retirement Bd.</span>, 485 Fed. Appx. 429, 431-32 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we first address the agency's argument that we lack jurisdiction because Burks first filed a petition with the EEOC. In general, we have jurisdiction over appeals from final orders of the Board under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). In a "mixed case" such as Burks's, in which it is alleged that a personnel action at issue before the MSPB is based on prohibited discrimination, the Board's decision is "judicially reviewable" as of</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;the date of issuance of the decision if the employee or applicant does not file a petition with the [EEOC] under subsection (b)(1) of this section, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_5309"></span>(B)&#x2003;the date the [EEOC] determines not to consider the decision under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3). Subsection (b)(1) states that an employee may petition the EEOC "within 30 days after notice of the decision of the Board," and subsection (b)(2) states that the EEOC "shall, within 30 days after the date of the petition, determine whether to consider the decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7702(b)(1)-(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's final order issued on June 2, 2011, and was apparently received by Burks shortly thereafter. On July 26, 2011, after the 30-day deadline of subsection (b)(1), the EEOC received a petition for review from Burks, which included a handwritten note asking the petition to be accepted as timely because he had sent two earlier petitions to the wrong address. Both parties agree that the petition was untimely. On July 27, 2011, a separate petition for review was received and filed by this court. Burks's EEOC appeal was closed, in response to his requests, on October 6, 2011. The agency argues that as of July 27, when Burks filed his Federal Circuit appeal, his case was not "judicially reviewable" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3) because Burks had filed a petition with the EEOC, and the EEOC had not "determine[d] not to consider the decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. An EEOC petition would bar judicial review only if the employee "file[s] a petition...under subsection (b)(1)," and subsection (b)(1) states that a petition may be filed "within 30 days." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3)(A), (b)(1). In <span class="Italic">Cloer v. Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 675 F.3d 1358, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), we recently held that an untimely petition may be "a petition filed under" a statutory provision where that provision is silent on timeliness. Here, however, we reach the opposite conclusion. Because subsection (b)(1) explicitly specifies a 30-day time limit, an employee only "file[s] a petition with the [EEOC] under subsection (b)(1)" if that petition is filed "within 30 days after notice of the decision of the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3)(A), (b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because both parties agree that Burks's petition to the EEOC was not filed within 30 days of his notice of the Board decision, we conclude that Burks's appeal in this court is "judicially reviewable" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(3), and that we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An extension of time from the MSPB to file a petition for review with the Board does not extend the time for filing a judicial petition for review with the Federal Circuit if the Board does not also alter the finality date set in the initial decision. If the Board grants an initial 40 days to file a petition for review, and does not alter the finality date of the initial decision when it grants the extension, and if the appellant fails to file a petition for review with the Board, then the time for seeking judicial review runs from the finality date of the initial decision and it is not extended for the 40 additional days granted by the MSPB to file an administrative petition for review. The Federal Circuit explained the matter with greater eloquence in <span class="Italic">Nacos v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 213 Fed. Appx. 987, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court treats Relda P. Nacos's correspondence concerning the timeliness of her petition for review as a motion for reconsideration of the court's previous rejection of her petition for review as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 19, 2006, the Administrative Judge (AJ) issued an initial decision informing Nacos that the AJ's decision would become a final Merit Systems Protection Board decision on May 24, 2006. <span class="Italic">Nacos v. Commerce,</span> No. DC-0752-06-0223-I-1. The AJ's decision specified that any petition for review must be filed with this court within 60 days of the date the decision became final, i.e., July 24, 2006. Nacos's petition for review was received by the court on October 16, 2006, 145 days after the AJ's decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nacos states that on July 27, 2006, the Board granted her an extension of time to file a petition for review with the Board and thus the AJ's decision did not become final until August 14, 2006. However, we note that at the time of the Board's July 27 order, the AJ's decision was already the Board's final decision, and the Board's order did not render the AJ's decision nonfinal. The Board's July 27 order stated that "[i]f a petition for review is not filed by August 14, 2006, the administrative judge's April 19, 2006, initial decision will remain the final decision of the Board and any further right of appeal must then be exercised in accordance with the provisions as stated in that initial decision." Thus, pursuant to that order, because Nacos did not file a petition for review with the Board by August 14, the time for Nacos petition for review was governed by the AJ's April 19 order, i.e. a petition for review was due no later than July 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 60-day filing period is "statutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Monzo v. Dept. of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Because Nacos's petition for review was received on October 16, 2006, 85 days late, this court must dismiss Nacos's petition as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should a Board decision be taken to a district court as a mixed case, and the EEO allegations are then withdrawn, followed by transfer of the appeal to the Federal Circuit, the district court filing date is treated as the circuit filing date. <span class="Italic">Jolly v.
