<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-351"><span class="space">7.</span> Mootness</h4>
<p class="noindent">A refusal to bargain case, <span class="Italic">SSA, OHA Charleston and Ass'n of ALJs, IFPTE</span>, 59 FLRA 646, 648-49 (2004), outlined the elements of mootness:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject as unsupported the Union's claim that subsequent events have rendered the case moot. A "dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome." <span class="Italic">United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 183 (1999) (citations omitted) (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>). The burden of demonstrating mootness "is a heavy one." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. W.T. Grant Co.</span>, 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953)). A party arguing mootness must demonstrate that: (1) "there is no reasonable expectation...that the alleged violation will recur[;]" and (2) "'interim relief or events have completely [or] irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.'" <span class="Italic">County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In determining whether subsequent events have caused unfair labor practice cases to become moot, the Authority has considered whether a decision, if rendered, "could have a practical legal effect." <span class="Italic">Fed'l Aviation Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 254, 261 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). In this respect, the Authority has noted that even if a particular remedy may no longer be appropriate, a case is not moot if a cease and desist order and the posting of a notice remain "viable" remedies<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not established that the case is moot.&#x2003;The parties, who have a continuing collective bargaining relationship, have legally cognizable interests in receiving a determination from the Authority as to whether the Respondent's action violated the Statute and, if so, what remedial relief would be appropriate. If a violation of the Statute were to be found, it is clear that viable remedies could be ordered, regardless of the move to a new location. Accordingly, the Union has not met the standards set forth above to demonstrate that this case is moot.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Council 222</span>, 71 FLRA 616, 618 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring), addressing mootness, involved an arbitrator's determination that the agency committed a ULP by denying a union's statutory information request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.[11] The party urging mootness meets its high burden of demonstrating that neither party has a legally cognizable interest in the final determination of the underlying questions of fact and law, upon satisfaction of two conditions: (1) that "there is no reasonable expectation...that the alleged violation will recur,"; and (2) "interim relief or events have completely [or] irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation."[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Small Bus. Admin</span>., 55 FLRA 179, 183 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>) (noting that the party asserting mootness has a high burden).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Cnty. of L.A. v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979))</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Agency does not argue that the violation will not recur or that the Panel's decision alters the finding that the Agency committed an unfair-labor-practice.[13] The Authority has held that a ULP does not become moot even if the grievant no longer has any complaints regarding the underlying dispute.[14] Accordingly, the Union's information request is not moot because the disclosure of the information pertains to an ongoing ULP that may recur.[15] Therefore, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Respondent has removed the letter of reprimand from the official's file, the potential for further discrimination against Union officials remains. Consequently, a cease and desist order barring such discrimination, along with a notice posting, would have a practical legal effect in the circumstances of this case.

<p class="noindent">Concerning the arguably mooting effect of a remedial order on a collective bargaining agreement entered subsequent to the issuance by FLRA of a cease and desist order directed against a prior unilateral change in employment conditions, the court determined in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 735 F.2d 1513, 1515-17 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (reviewing and enforcing cease and desist order in <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Air Force, OK City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 8 FLRA 740 (1982)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It is well settled in the context of labor relations that "the employer's compliance with an order of the [NLRB] does not render [an enforcement proceeding] moot....&#8197;The rationale for this rule is that cease and desist orders generally impose on employers a continuing obligation to refrain from violations of employees' rights. An enforcement decree ensures against future resumption of the unfair labor practice. Thus, even if the employer has ceased the practices that precipitated the order, an enforcement proceeding is not moot....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Authority's order charges the Air Force with a continuing obligation to bargain before instituting a unilateral change in facial hair policy. This obligation remains throughout the parties' ongoing relationship. The Air Force must bargain before instituting a unilateral change in policy regardless of whether a facial hair policy has been agreed to in a subsequent contract....&#8197;Thus, even if the Air Force has bargained during the 1982 contract negotiations over the substance of the facial hair policy, we reject the contention that this enforcement proceeding is thereby rendered moot....[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The additional portions of the Authority's order serve important remedial functions: (1) to provide for bargaining over impact and implementation of the change in facial hair policy, (2) to notify employees of their organizational rights, and (3) to ensure that the employer refrains from similar or continuing unlawful activities. Courts have long recognized that orders in the labor relations area need not be concerned solely with the isolated incident that precipitated an unfair labor practice charge. Rather, the NLRB and the FLRA have an obligation to protect the continuing right of employees to engage in concerted activity....</p>
<p class="noindent">No remedy was ordered as to a local labor organization that was defunct. However, a remedy was available to the successor local. <span class="Italic">AFGE and Partlow</span>, 51 FLRA 1427, 1440 (1996). FLRA explained the doctrine of mootness as to disestablished unions in <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found unfair labor practice cases moot where the former exclusive representative was no longer recognized and no individual rights were involved<span class="Italic">. See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Southwest Region</span>, 11 FLRA 36 (1983) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, <span class="Italic">Southwest</span>). The only issue in <span class="Italic">FAA, Southwest</span> was the union's institutional right to be represented at certain formal discussions. Because the union's exclusive recognition had been revoked, the Authority found that "any decision rendered herein [could not] have any practical legal effect" and dismissed the complaint<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Secretary, Headquarters</span>, 20 FLRA 175, n.2 (1985) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>) (case not moot, despite the replacement of the former exclusive representative by another union, because institutional rights of the new representative as well as individual rights of employees were involved); <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Spokane Tower/Approach Control</span>, 15 FLRA 668 (1984) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Spokane</span>) (case not moot despite revocation of the union's exclusive recognition because rights of individual employees under section 7102 of the Statute were involved); <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center, Fremont, California</span>, 14 FLRA 201 (1984) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Oakland</span>) (case not moot despite revocation of the union's exclusive recognition because rights of individual employees to act on behalf of and be represented by a union were involved); <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center, Nashua</span>, <span class="Italic">New Hampshire</span>, 11 FLRA 318 (1983) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Nashua</span>) (case not moot despite revocation of the union's exclusive recognition because rights of individual employees to be free of discrimination based on protected activity were involved).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A case does not, however, become moot simply because a particular remedy may no longer be appropriate. For example, the fact that an employee no longer worked for the Border Patrol did not render the case moot "because [the Statute] provides remedies that are still available to FLRA." <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 289 (5th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1941 v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 495, 497 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (even after employee's death, suitable remedies, such as cease and desist order or posting of notice to employees by respondent agency, were still available).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Respondent and the Union no longer exist.&#x2003;The General Counsel points out, however, that the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE) and DMA continue to exist, and suggests that both NFFE and DMA may be regarded as "successors" to the Union and the Activity. However, the General Counsel offers no support for this suggestion and none is otherwise apparent. An agency is obligated, under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, to furnish information <span class="Italic">to the exclusive representative</span>. NFFE is not the exclusive representative in this case, and no other exclusive representative exists to receive the requested information or to make any use of it. Nor is there any contention that DMA has an employer relationship with any of the employees in Local 1482's former bargaining unit. In these circumstances, the General Counsel has not shown that DMA is a successor employer for purposes of assuming liability for any unfair labor practices committed by the Respondent<span class="Italic">. Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Golden State Bottling Co. v. NLRB</span>, 414 U.S. 168 (1973) (Supreme Court adopted principles Board announced in <span class="Italic">Perma Vinyl Corporation.</span>, 164 NLRB 968 (1967), that successor employer with notice of a pending unfair labor practice proceeding, under circumstances which charge him with notice, is held liable for remedies that are a consequence of predecessor's unfair labor practices); <span class="Italic">Local Union No. 46</span> <span class="Italic">Metallic Lathers</span>, 259 NLRB 70 (1981), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds sub nom</span>. 727 F.2d 234 (2d Cir. 1984) (applying <span class="Italic">Perma Vinyl</span> principles to assess liability on a successor union for the acts of a predecessor).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1612"></span>In addition, unlike <span class="Italic">HHS, FAA, Spokane, FAA, Oakland</span>, and <span class="Italic">FAA, Nashua</span>, there are no individual rights to be adjudicated in this case. Instead, as in <span class="Italic">FAA, Southwest</span>, where only the union's institutional right to attend formal discussions was involved, the only right at issue here is the institutional right of the exclusive representative to obtain information under section 7114(b)(4). Even if the Authority were to consider Madison's individual interests in disputing the suspension of his security clearance, that consideration would not lead to a different result. Madison acknowledged at the hearing that "other than a possible [ULP] proceeding, the suspension 'can't be grieved or appealed or anything.'" Neither the General Counsel nor the Union has explained how an unfair labor practice proceeding could assist Madison in challenging the Respondent's suspension of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Union offers no support for its assertion that DMA is "still retaliating" against Madison. The Union's contention that the suspension of Madison's security clearance could affect his career and those of his children is similarly unsubstantiated. Finally, there is no evidence suggesting that DMA's closure of the Louisville office was in any way related to the pendency of this unfair labor practice complaint, and no basis on which to conclude that any other agencies would contemplate the closure of offices to evade their responsibilities under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, we conclude that this case has been rendered moot by the closure of the Louisville office. Any decision we might render would, as a result, have no practical legal effect. Such a decision would also be tantamount to an advisory opinion, which is precluded by section 2429.10 of the Authority's regulations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach this conclusion reluctantly, because we recognize that it brings to an end, without final resolution, a dispute that the General Counsel, after investigation, determined warranted the issuance of a complaint alleging that an unfair labor practice had been committed. That mootness can occur during the course of litigation is a regrettable potential byproduct of formal adjudication because delay can occur at each and every step of the process--investigation, hearing, and the numerous possible appeals to the Authority and the courts--that can precede final disposition. In this case, the events causing mootness occurred during the period between the hearing and issuance of the Judge's decision; this could also have happened at a different point along the way, however. Unfortunately, this is one of the realities that makes litigation a less than satisfactory way to resolve disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties here have received only the recommended decision of the Judge.&#x2003;However, even if, upon review, the Authority were to disagree with the Judge's recommended decision, in the circumstances before us, a violation is no longer capable of being remedied. Indeed, even the most basic remedy--the posting of a notice to employees--is unavailable as the Respondent no longer exists....</p>
