<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-77"><span class="space">E.</span> REVIEW OF ARBITRATION AWARDS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> was developed as a reference for MSPB decisions. Many arbitration decisions, known as "awards," are issued on adverse actions and RIFs. Only a few are reviewed by the Board; fewer are appealed to the courts. But for appeals filed in court after October 1, 1982 (the effective date of the Federal Courts Improvement Act), the Federal Circuit is the place for review of arbitration awards in cases otherwise appealable to the Board and not involving EEO issues. <span class="Italic">Long v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 751 F.2d 339, 343 (10th Cir. 1984). The key phrase is "otherwise appealable to the Board," e.g., there is no jurisdiction in the Federal Circuit to review an arbitration decision involving the removal of an individual who would not have had an appeal right to the Board, for example, the termination of a VA Title 38 doctor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3637 v. EEOC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-580) (describing jurisdiction before the 1990 legislation extending appeal rights to excepted service employees). The Federal Circuit lacks jurisdiction to consider an arbitration award involving the termination of a TVA employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wagner v. TVA</span>, 41 Fed. Appx. 389 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP). The court will not review an award that is issued on a procedural issue collateral to an award that is reviewable because it involves an adverse action. Federal Circuit jurisdiction extends only to review of awards if the matter could have been appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson-Almowallad v. GSA,</span> 136 Fed. Appx. 358, 362 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP). Other judicial doctrines apply to review of arbitration awards. If an employee secures from the MSPB all the relief available under the law, his appeal of an unfavorable arbitration award in the same case may be dismissed as moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 112 Fed. Appx. 27 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "Proper Parties in Court; Standing; Mootness," and "Arbitration Award."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although no attempt is made here to catalog arbitrators' decisions on actions <span id="Page_5283"></span>that could be within the Board's jurisdiction, court decisions on these cases will be reviewed. Some decisions will have at least limited applicability to issues before the Board. Some cases will provide guidance for those seeking or defending against review of arbitration decisions. [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>," for MSPB jurisdiction to review arbitrators' decisions involving discrimination claims; refer to Broida's, <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Sector Arbitration Law</span> (Dewey Publications, Inc. 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute indirectly vesting authority in the Federal Circuit to review certain federal-sector arbitration awards, 5 USC 7121(f), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board. In matters similar to those covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which arise under other personnel systems and which an aggrieved employee has raised under the negotiated grievance procedure, judicial review of an arbitrator's award may be obtained in the same manner and on the same basis as could be obtained of a final decision in such matters raised under applicable appellate procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reid v.

<p class="Body-Text">An arbitration award involving an adverse action is ordinarily reviewed in the Federal Circuit, not by the Federal Labor Relations Authority or the MSPB, unless for MSPB review the grievance presented to the arbitrator involves an allegation of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Morin v.

[Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>."] Section 7121 inherently limits the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit to review of only some arbitration awards involving statutorily defined federal agencies and employees. Declining to review an award sustaining the dismissal of a nonpreference eligible employee of the Postal Service, <span class="Italic">Burke v. USPS</span>, 888 F.2d 833, 834-35 (Fed. Cir. 1989), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has "exclusive jurisdiction... of an appeal from a final order or final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board pursuant to sections 7703(b)(1) and 7703(d) of title 5." 28 USC 1295(a)(9) (1982). However, 5 USC 7121(f) (1988) is our sole jurisdictional grant for review of an arbitrator's award. That section authorizes the same review for arbitration awards under a negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to section 7121(a) as that available for decisions of the... Board. 5 USC 7121(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As is clear from the language of 5 USC 7111 (1988), and implicit in the reasoning adopted by this court in <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 811 F.2d 1498, 1501-02 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the negotiated grievance procedures authorized by section 7121(a) are limited to those between <span class="Italic">agencies</span> and labor organizations. An agency for purposes of section 7121(a) is defined as an "[e]xecutive agency." 5 USC 7103(a)(3) (1988). The Postal Service is an independent establishment of the executive branch rather than an executive agency. 39 USC 201 (1982). Because the Postal Service is not an executive agency, Burke's arbitration award was not the result of a negotiated grievance procedure authorized by section 7121(a). Therefore, section 7121, on its face, does not empower this court to entertain an appeal of an arbitrator's award pursuant to a Postal Service collective bargaining agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Additionally, nonpreference eligible postal employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement are limited to the grievance procedures provided by that agreement.... &#8197;Because no provision of the pertinent statutes makes section 7121 applicable to nonpreference eligible employees of the Postal Service, we are without jurisdiction of this appeal.</p>

While 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 authorizes the same review of arbitration decisions by the Federal Circuit as is available for decisions by the Board, &#x00A7; 7121 and its implementing regulations are not applicable to Postal Service employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court's jurisdiction over arbitration awards is narrower than its jurisdiction over MSPB decisions. 5 USC 7703(a)(1) vests in the Federal Circuit jurisdiction to review a petition by any employee aggrieved by a final Board order or decision. But 5 USC 7121(f) grants jurisdiction to the Federal Circuit to review an arbitration award only "if the matter is one 'covered under' 5 USC 4303 (1994) [performance cases] or 5 USC 7512 [adverse actions] (1994)." <span class="Italic">Schafer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 88 F.3d 981, 985 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (considering, but finding no jurisdiction over, an arbitration award affirming termination of the contract of an excepted service teacher; expiration or nonrenewal of the contract did not constitute an adverse action); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Reddick v. FDIC</span>, 809 F.3d 1253, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The matters subject to such a grievance-resolution procedure and arbitration are defined by the collective bargaining agreement and are not necessarily limited to only those adverse actions covered by &#x00A7; 7512. However, judicial review of an arbitrator's decision by this court is still limited to only those adverse actions covered by &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f); <span class="Italic">see also Schafer v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 88 F.3d 981, 984-85 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Thus, while Mr. Reddick may have been able to submit his dispute over the cancellation of his term extension to the arbitrator under his collective bargaining agreement, we only possess jurisdiction if Mr. Reddick was removed from his position within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7512."). Residual jurisdiction over other arbitration awards is vested with the Federal Labor Relations Authority or, for EEO or Whistleblower, VEOA or USERRA cases, under the review procedures identified by those statutes. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 amendments allow for review of some whistleblower cases in the regional circuit courts of appeal. Section 108 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 amendments permit an appellant or OPM to secure review in circuit appellate courts. If an appellant (grievant) takes a covered case to a regional circuit court of appeals, the reconsideration process for OPM that would otherwise apply to the Federal Circuit applies in the circuit court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(b)(1)(A), (d)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court's review of an arbitrator's award is broader than that undertaken by a court in the private sector. <span class="Italic">Muller v. GPO</span>, 809 F.3d 1375, 1378-80 (Fed. Cir. 2016), reversing an arbitrator's ruling to deny a merits determination based on a contract rule requiring a decision within four months of a request for arbitration, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), a federal employee seeking to challenge disciplinary action by his employing agency may appeal his claim to the MSPB or, alternatively, take his claim to an independent arbitrator under a negotiated grievance procedure created by collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator's decision is reviewed by this court under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f). Section 7121(f) establishes that arbitrations of such grievances are reviewed under the same standard of review that applies to appeals from decisions of the MSPB. The statute provides that, "[i]n matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title... shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by <span id="Page_5284"></span>the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f); <span class="Italic">see also Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 661 n.16 (1985); <span class="Italic">Newman v. Corrado</span>, 897 F.2d 1579, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Mr. Muller's claim arises under &#x00A7; 7512, as it concerns a reduction in grade and a reduction in pay, so &#x00A7; 7703 applies here. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3), (4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7703(c) requires this court to set aside "any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see also Appleberry v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 793 F.3d 1291, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The standard of review under &#x00A7; 7703 differs from the standard that applies to arbitrations conducted under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> where an arbitrator's decision can be set aside only under narrow circumstances, such as corruption or misconduct on the part of the arbitrator. 9 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10(a); <span class="Italic">see also Hall Street Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel, Inc.,</span> 552 U.S. 576, 584-85 (2008); <span class="Italic">First Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan</span>, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995). This difference, with substantially less deference granted to arbitrations of the grievances of federal employees, is consistent with the purpose of the CSRA, which created arbitration defined by collective bargaining agreement as a parallel alternative to dispute resolution at the MSPB. "Congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the Board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision." <span class="Italic">Cornelius</span>, 472 U.S. at 660.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA makes clear that employees and their unions are obliged to invoke arbitration promptly, or their claims are forfeited. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) ("An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter... under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee... <span class="Italic">timely</span> files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure... .") (emphasis added). As the government points out, failure to comply with the deadline for invoking arbitration can result in dismissal of an employee's grievance. In <span class="Italic">Appleberry</span>, we upheld an arbitrator's dismissal of a federal employee's claim because it "was not properly 'raised under the negotiated grievance procedure' in the first place," 793 F.3d at 1297, the employee having failed to invoke arbitration within 30 days of the agency's denial of her grievance, as required by the controlling collective bargaining agreement, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1294.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the CSRA does not itself create any statutory timing requirements that apply after arbitration has been invoked. Instead, arbitration of grievances is allowed to proceed under a timetable and procedural rules set by the governing collective bargaining agreement. We have noted that "[c]ourts should be careful not to 'judicialize' the arbitration process. Arbitration normally envisions that each case be decided on its own under the controlling contract...." <span class="Italic">Gonce v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 872 F.2d 995, 998 (Fed. Cir. 1989). "The collective bargaining agreement is the primary tool used in the arbitration process." <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 892 F.2d 1036, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 1990). It is therefore up to the negotiating parties to impose any internal deadlines on the arbitration process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government notes, correctly, that "collective bargaining agreements are... contracts governed by the rules of contract interpretation." (quoting <span class="Italic">Muniz v. Newman</span>, 972 F.2d 1304, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). "Interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement is a question of law we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 780 F.3d 1145, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">see also Huey v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 782 F.2d 1575, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("It is well settled that the interpretation of a[&#8197;] [collective bargaining] agreement is for the court."). We conclude that noncompliance with the four-month deadline in Section 10.d.(4) of Article VII of the master agreement does not require dismissal of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> judicial review of an arbitrator's contract interpretation may not be in accord with the Supreme Court's view of the labor arbitrator's role, <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &#x0026; Car. Corp.</span>, 363 U.S. 593, 597, 80 S. Ct. 1358 (1960):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an arbitrator is commissioned to interpret and apply the collective bargaining agreement, he is to bring his informed judgment to bear in order to reach a fair solution of a problem. This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There, the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations. The draftsmen may never have thought of what specific remedy should be awarded to meet a particular contingency. Nevertheless, an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may, of course, look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. When the arbitrator's words manifest an infidelity to this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of the award.</p>

Cir. 2009 NP) (credibility resolutions of arbitrator, as with the MSPB, are "virtually unreviewable" before the Federal Circuit; arbitrator is not required to consider each and every one of <span id="Page_5285"></span>the dozen <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors any more than the Board must).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noting that an arbitrator's award and a Board decision are reviewed under the same standard, <span class="Italic">Norris v. SEC</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/11-3129%20order.pdf">675 F.3d 1349</a>, 1352-53 (Fed. Cir. 2012), explained that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), we review a decision by an arbitrator "in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the [Merit Systems Protection] Board"; and our review of Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") decisions is limited. We may only set aside agency actions, findings, or conclusions that we find to be "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see also Bennett v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the same substantive standards applied to Board appeals and arbitration cases involving matters that could have been taken to the Board, the arbitrator is not precluded from applying contract procedural requirements that limit the arbitrator's review to something less than what might be received through a Board appeal. In <span class="Italic">Appleberry v. DHS</span>, 793 F.3d 1291 (Fed. Cir. 2015), involving a performance-based removal, the employee challenged through the grievance procedure the agency's conclusion that her PIP performance was unsatisfactory. That grievance, denied by the agency under the labor contract, was not pursued to arbitration. But taken to arbitration was a grievance challenging the removal resulting from unsuccessful PIP performance. The arbitrator declined to consider performance during the PIP because that issue was earlier presented through a grievance not elevated to arbitration. The Board would have considered PIP performance as an integral component of a removal appeal. But, the circuit held, the arbitrator's decision to limit the scope of his review was not reversible error, 793 F.3d at 1297:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In following the procedural requirements of the Agreement, the arbitrator, consistent with <span class="Italic">Cornelius</span>, applied the same substantive standards as applied by the Board. The arbitrator's reason for limiting consideration of certain issues had everything to do with the process required by the agreement. As Ms. Appleberry has pointed to no statutory provision, in Chapter 43 or otherwise, preventing the adoption of this contracted-for process, we conclude that the arbitrator did not err. <span class="Italic">See Wissman</span>, 848 F.2d at 178; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett</span>, 556 U.S. 247, 257-60 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bragg v. Keohane</span>, 820 F.2d 402, 403 (Fed. Cir. 1987), confirmed the Federal Circuit's role as reviewer of an arbitration award in an appeal involving a misconduct termination of a Bureau of Prisons employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bragg appealed her dismissal through the collective bargaining grievance procedure of the Bureau. On October 13, 1982, the arbitrator upheld the Bureau's action in all respects and refused to mitigate the penalty. Under CSRA, Bragg had the right to obtain review of the arbitrator's decision in this court, but she did not do so. After the time for such action, on September 18, 1983, Bragg filed suit in the district court challenging her removal. The district court dismissed Bragg's complaint on the ground that CSRA provides the exclusive statutory remedies for review of Bragg's claim. Accordingly, the court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bragg argues that the district court was wrong as a matter of law in holding that the CSRA is her exclusive remedy because the CSRA remedies do not adequately protect her constitutional rights. Even if that were correct, which it is not,[1] the district court had no jurisdiction over her suit. In her complaint, Bragg asserted that the district court's jurisdiction was based on federal question jurisdiction, 28 USC 1331 (1982), and, with respect to her monetary claims, admits that she is relying on the Tucker Act, 28 USC 1346(a)(2). Under 28 USC 1346(a)(2), however, the district court loses jurisdiction which it shares with the Claims Court once plaintiff's claim exceeds $10,000. Her back pay claim to her GS-9 position ($21,804 per annum), ostensibly exceeded that amount even at the time she filed suit. In view of the amount of her claim, the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bray v. United States</span>, 785 F.2d 989 (Fed. Cir. 1986), and more importantly, from our perspective, the district court's jurisdiction was not based, "in whole or in part, on section 1346 of [Title 28, USC]." 28 USC 1295(a)(2). That being the case, the court has no jurisdiction over Bragg's appeal from the district court judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beard v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in which this court said it would consider constitutional issues even though raised for the first time on appeal, and <span class="Italic">Fiorillo v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, 795 F.2d 1544 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in which this court considered, on appeal from arbitration, a constitutional challenge to another portion of the employee conduct rules challenged here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has subject matter jurisdiction over Bragg's appeal by treating her appeal as a petition to review the decision of the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the existence of subject matter jurisdiction to review that decision, this court cannot now exercise such jurisdiction. In order to obtain review of the arbitrator's decision, Bragg was required to petition this court "within 30 days after the date the petitioner received notice of the final order or decision... " 5 USC 7703(b)(1). Even treating the filing date of Bragg's complaint in the district court as the date of filing a petition for review in this court, she filed over ten months late. This court has no authority to waive or extend that time period or to address the merits of that decision, which has become a final adverse determination of her right to reinstatement and back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit does not review cases involving issues of alleged discrimination. Review of those cases is vested in a federal district court. According to the D.C. Circuit, if a mixed case that would have been within the Board's jurisdiction is instead taken to a labor arbitrator, before the case can be taken to a district court, it must first proceed to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052 v. Reno</span>, 992 F.2d 331, 335 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (on review of the denial by an arbitrator of a claim for counsel fees following the successful prosecution of a mixed case to the arbitrator), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Holly v. DHHS</span>, 69 Fed. Appx. 467 (Fed.
