<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-221"><span class="space">8.</span> Supervisory or Nonunit Vacancies</h4>
<p class="noindent">An award involving filling a supervisor position will be analyzed to determine whether it violates management's right to select or assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) and (C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and IFPTE Local 2</span>, 49 FLRA 1363, 1368-69 (1994) (setting the award aside). An agency may elect to apply collective bargaining procedures to the filling of a management position, and if it so elects the agency will be bound by that election when the union seeks to enforce the obligation through grievance arbitration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, 50 FLRA 88, 92 n.4 (1995). <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 690, 693 (2002), observed as to an agency's exceptions to an award concerning selection for two supervisory positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the Agency's cited case law, however, we note that these cases concern either an arbitrator's interpretation of a specific collective bargaining agreement, or Authority findings that proposed procedures for filling non-bargaining unit positions are not mandatorily negotiable. <span class="Italic">See Local 28, </span>50 FLRA at 536; <span class="Italic">North Island, </span>39 FLRA at 648-49, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32,</span> 22 FLRA at 483; <span class="Italic">Field Labor Locals, </span>3 FLRA at 292. With respect to our interpretation of the two later cited cases, we note that the D.C. Circuit agreed with the Authority in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1012, AFL-CIO v. FLRA, </span>841 F.2d 1165, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1988), that a proposal concerning the filling of a supervisory position is negotiable at the election of an agency. <span class="Italic">See also FOP, Lodge #1F,</span> 57 FLRA 373, 380 n.13 (2001). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of a priority consideration to a non-bargaining unit position is not prohibited as a matter of law. Therefore, the award is not deficient on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, Rural Dev. Oklahoma and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 59 FLRA 983, 985-86 (2004), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Even assuming that, as applied in this case, these provisions are permissive subjects of bargaining because they concern a non-unit position, Authority precedent is clear that provisions resulting from elections to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining are enforceable in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Washington, D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 393, 395 (2000) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). <span class="Italic">See also Soc. Sec. Admin., Baltimore, Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 690, 693-94 (2002) (exception denied contesting arbitrability of grievance over a contract provision giving priority consideration for non-unit positions). The Authority has unambiguously rejected the argument that awards enforcing provisions resulting from bargaining over permissive subjects concern "waiver of a statutory right and not contract interpretation." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 56 FLRA at 394. Specifically, the Authority held that an election to bargain "constitutes the exercise of the right...not an abandonment or relinquishment of the right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 396.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may enforce agency regulations referenced in the contract that concern consideration of individuals for what appear to be supervisory positions. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R-1-185 and Adjutant Gen. of Connecticut</span>, 25 FLRA 509, 509-12 (1987), upheld the arbitrator's arbitrability determination on a matter involving the filling of a supervisory general foreman position. Unless there is a specific exclusion in the agreement, a grievance concerning a violation of an agency regulation in the selection process was a grievance within &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) and arbitrable under negotiated grievance procedures. The result in the <span class="Italic">Connecticut Adjutant Genera</span>l case actually turned on the agency's defense that the case was not arbitrable because the job was eventually filled as a military position, but the reasoning was applicable to grievances concerning filling of supervisory positions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance in this case concerned the filling of an aircraft ordnance systems mechanic, general foreman position. The Agency advertised the position in a Technician Information Bulletin. The announcement specified the qualifications for the position and indicated that it could be filled either as a civilian technician position or as an active duty military position for an Active Guard Reserve (AGR) tour. The qualifications included 36 months experience in certain listed functions and possession of a certain Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC). The Agency determined that five qualified technicians applied and two qualified AGR candidates applied. The Agency filled the position as an active duty military tour. A grievance was filed on behalf of a civilian technician who was not selected for the position. The grievance alleged that the Agency violated Technician Personnel Procedures (TPP) No. 4-2, entitled Merit Promotion Procedures, primarily because the AGR candidate selected for the position did not meet the requisite qualifications. The grievance proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency essentially made two arguments before the Arbitrator.&#x2003;First, the Agency argued that the grievance was neither grievable nor arbitrable. In support of this argument, the Agency asserted that because the position was filled as an active duty military position, the grievance concerned a purely military matter and that its action in filling the position was not subject to the Technician Personnel Procedures or to the parties' collective bargaining agreement, including the negotiated grievance procedures. Second, the Agency argued that the selection of the AGR candidate was protected under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the grievance was arbitrable.&#x2003;He based his determination on his interpretation of the parties' agreement as including "published agency policies" and, specifically, TPP 4-2. On the merits, the Arbitrator determined that the selection action did not conform to TPP 4-2. The Arbitrator found that by advertising the position to civilian technicians, the Agency was required under TPP 4-2 to select the best qualified among the applicants, including both technicians and AGR personnel. The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency had not done so in this case because it appeared that the AGR candidate who was selected lacked the AFSC qualification and instead was assertedly qualified by the Agency administering him a special test. The Arbitrator <span id="page_2096"></span>found that there was an appearance of unfairness and that the basis for the individual's selection under the applicable procedures had not been adequately explained. Accordingly, as his award, the Arbitrator ordered that the Agency reconsider the matter and select from among the best qualified applicants who had already applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;EXCEPTIONS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As its exceptions the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award finding the grievance arbitrable and resolving the dispute on the merits is deficient on four grounds: (1) the award is contrary to law, rule, and regulation: (2) the award does not draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement; (3) the award is so incomplete, ambiguous, or contradictory that implementation is impossible; and, (4) the Arbitrator exceeded the scope of his authority. In support of its exceptions the Agency essentially reiterates the same arguments made before the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Arbitrability</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues as it did before the Arbitrator that the grievance in this matter is not grievable because the position involved was eventually filled as an active duty military position.&#x2003;We find that the Agency's argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute defines "grievance" as any complaint "by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee...or a claim of breach of a collective bargaining agreement or any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment." Moreover, unless specifically excluded, grievances are covered by negotiated grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that where, as here, an agency announces a position vacancy and seeks applications from qualified employees, a grievance alleging a violation of an agency regulation or collective bargaining agreement in the selection process is a "grievance" within the meaning of section 7103(a)(9). In the absence of any specific exclusion, such a grievance properly may be determined by an arbitrator to be grievable and arbitrable under negotiated grievance procedures. We conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's determination that the employee's grievance in this case was arbitrable is contrary to law, rule or regulation, or that the determination is in any way deficient as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Merits</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that in filling positions, management has the right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute to make the actual substantive determination in the selection and appointment process. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3553, AFL-CIO and Veterans Administration Medical Center, New Orleans, Louisiana,</span> 18 FLRA No. 65 (1985). Moreover, the Authority has expressly held that section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides for management's right in filling positions to make a selection from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Administration Services Management Area, Syracuse and National Association of Government Employees, Local No. R2-65,</span> 20 FLRA No. 91 (1985); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Infantry Center, Ft. Benning, Georgia and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 54,</span> AFL-CIO, 12 FLRA 161 (1983). However, the Authority has repeatedly indicated in disputed selection action cases that where an arbitrator finds that the selection process did not conform to applicable requirements, such as requirements in agency regulations, the arbitrator may order the selection action rerun or reconstructed as corrective action. For example, <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Administration Services Management Area (DCASMA), Cedar Rapids, Iowa and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2752, AFL-CIO,</span> 10 FLRA 547 (1982); <span class="Italic">Adjutant General, State of Oklahoma, Air National Guard and American Federation of Government Employees, Will Rogers Air National Guard Local 3953,</span> 8 FLRA 112 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find, in agreement with the Agency, that the award is deficient insofar as the Arbitrator directed a selection from among the best qualified applicants who had applied. To the extent the award may limit the Agency in filling the position to the list of best qualified civilian technician candidates and preclude the Agency from filling the position from another appropriate source, that is, from among active duty military candidates, the award is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(C). However, we also find that the Agency provides no basis for finding the award deficient insofar as the Arbitrator ordered the selection action to be "reconsidered," in other words, to be rerun or reconstructed. The Arbitrator found an appearance of unfairness that had not been adequately explained as a result of which the selection action failed to conform to TPP 4-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;DECISION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, the award on the merits is modified to provide the following remedy in place of that directed by the Arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Agency shall reconstruct or rerun the selection action in this case. The reconstruction or rerunning of the selection action by the Agency must conform with controlling law and regulation and the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and must be communicated and explained to the Union and the original best qualified applicants for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award favoring the union as to a selection for a supervisory position was sustained, <span class="Italic">DOD, Illinois NG, Scott AFB and ACT Chapter 111</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-49.html">69 FLRA 345</a>, 347-50 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's determination that only the two grievants were qualified for the position violated the Agency's management right to "select from among those that management believes are best." In contrast, the Union argues that: management's right to select applies only to "selections for appointments from...among <span class="Italic">properly</span> ranked and certified candidates"; and because the Arbitrator found that the candidates had <span class="Italic">not</span> been properly ranked and certified, the award does not violate management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions that contend that an award is contrary to a management right, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of a right set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a). As relevant here, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute, management has the right, "with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from...among <span class="Italic">properly ranked and certified</span> candidates for promotion[,] or...any other <span class="Italic">appropriate</span> source."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, it is unnecessary to resolve the parties' dispute over whether the award affects this management right. For the following reasons, even if it does, the award does not <span class="Italic">impermissibly</span> affect the right.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority previously has held, most recently in <span class="Italic">U.S. OPM</span>,[34] if an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), then the Authority examines whether the arbitrator was enforcing--as relevant here--an "applicable law," within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).[35] The Authority has held that an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) includes not only statutes, but as relevant here, regulations having the force and effect of law.[36]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has considered whether agency regulations constitute an applicable law under these requirements.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado</span>[38] and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>,[39] the Authority held that the agency regulations at issue in those decisions had the force and effect of law and constituted applicable laws.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, there is no dispute that Agency regulation TPP 335 is mandatory and establishes the obligations of the Agency and the rights of employees with respect to promotions and assignments within the Agency. Accordingly, the first requirement is satisfied. As to the second requirement, Congress has expressly authorized the President of the United States to prescribe rules governing the competitive service, and the President has, in turn, so authorized the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[40] Consistent with this authority, OPM has promulgated rules governing agency promotion and placement programs from which TPP 335 is derived.[41] As to the final requirement, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)[42] specifically exempts matters relating to agency management and personnel from the notice and comment requirements otherwise required for regulations by the APA.[43] Accordingly, the third requirement is satisfied. We conclude that the TPP 335 is a regulation having the force and effect of law, and thus constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Agency regulation TPP 335 when it selected for the supervisor position an applicant who was unqualified.&#x2003;According to the Arbitrator, the only qualified applicants were the two grievants. It is well established that the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings, unless a finding has been successfully challenged as a nonfact, which is not the case here.[44] In his award, the Arbitrator credited the testimony of the retired, former supervisor who testified about the requirements for the position as given in the job announcement, namely the thirty-six months of technical experience with the equipment at issue, and who testified that only the two grievants had that required experience and that the selectee did not. While the Agency challenges the credibility and persuasiveness of the former supervisor's testimony, we have already determined that the "missing" resumes are barred under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5, and the Agency does not provide any other support for its challenge. Therefore, as the Agency's arguments lack support in the record, we find the Agency's arguments to be bare assertions.[45] Finally, we note TPP 335 requires that candidates meet the basic qualifications established for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Disability Adjudication &#x0026; Review, Region VI, New Orleans, La</span>., 67 FLRA 597, 604 (2014) (<span class="Italic">SSA New Orleans</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, U.S. Marshalls Serv., Justice Prisoner &#x0026; Alien Transp.

<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, as the award is based on the Arbitrator's enforcement of an "applicable law," the Agency fails to establish that the award impermissibly affects its management right to select employees. The Agency does not successfully challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings or otherwise demonstrate that the award misapplies the Agency regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Authority notes that the Agency did argue very briefly that the award also infringed on its right to assign work, and cited as support for this argument two negotiability decisions.[47] Nonetheless, even assuming the argument was sufficiently raised and even assuming the Agency's right to assign work was affected by the award, the Arbitrator was enforcing an applicable law, as discussed above. Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award impermissibly affects its right to assign work.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In particular, the Agency challenges that portion of the remedy where the Arbitrator ordered a different selecting official to participate in the new selection process, one who was outside the supervisory chain of the grievants, and who did not participate in the original merit promotion process or in the grievance process. The Union, in its opposition, indicates that it is "not oppose[d]" to vacating that portion of the remedy. Where an opposing party concedes that a remedy is deficient, the Authority modifies the award to set aside the deficient remedy. Consistent with this precedent, we modify the award to set aside this portion of the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency challenges that portion of the remedy in which the Arbitrator orders the names of the two grievants to be certified to the selecting official for consideration as "overly broad" because the Arbitrator's order "limits the pool" of applicants. We find this argument, unsupported by any caselaw, unpersuasive.[58] Indeed, the final portion of the remedy provides the next step in the event the selecting official selects neither grievant. As such, we are not persuaded that the Agency has demonstrated this aspect of the remedy is deficient.[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;For the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 112, Chairman Pope agrees that the Agency provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's remedy deficient. Specifically, she finds that the remedy is reasonably related to TPP 335 and the harm being remedied. However, she questions whether the majority's decision not to address the "reasonably related" standard is consistent with recent Authority precedent. In this regard, she acknowledges that, for a period of time, the Authority declined--over her objections--to apply that standard in cases where a party challenged an arbitrator's remedy on management-rights grounds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla</span>., 65 FLRA 1040, 1045 n.9 (2011) (not applying reasonably related requirement to an excepting party's management-rights challenge to an arbitral remedy); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Med. Ctr., Kan. City, Mo</span>., 65 FLRA 809, 814 n.8 (2011) (same). However, more recently, the Authority has addressed the reasonably related standard in cases where such remedial challenges are made. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Redstone</span>, 68 FLRA at 125-26 (setting out reasonably related standard as part of management-rights framework but finding it premature to assess whether that requirement was met, because the Authority could make findings on remand that would clarify how the remedy related to the violations found); <span class="Italic">SSA New Orleans</span>, 67 FLRA at 602 (Member Pizzella dissenting) (setting out the "reasonably related" standard as part of the legal framework); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 603 &#x0026; n.103 (applying the standard and noting that, to the extent that certain prior precedent "implies that the...standard is not an appropriate standard to apply to resolve management-rights challenges to an arbitral remedy, it will no longer be followed."). She questions what guiding principle her colleagues are using to avoid applying that standard in this case, and why their avoidance of it does not reflect arbitrary and capricious decision-making.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our concurring colleague's claim that the Authority must apply the "reasonably-related" standard to resolve the Agency's challenge to the Arbitrator's remedy in this case is unfounded. As the Authority stated in its <span class="Italic">FDIC, Division of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Protection, San Francisco Region</span> decision, that "an arbitrator's award must...be reasonably related to the [applicable law violated] and the harm being remedied...is not intended to establish a new two-pronged analytical framework that will be recited in every case involving an award alleged to violate management rights."[61] It suffices in a case such as this, where there is no claim that the Arbitrator's remedy is not reasonably related to the violation of an applicable law, that the award provides a remedy for the violation. The Authority's variation from this general policy in a single case[62] is not, in our view, sufficient to establish binding precedent to the contrary.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that that the award is contrary to law because it "impinges" on the "military's right," also described as the "right[s] of the military," to promote those "who are best for the military position." In this connection, the Agency contends that the award "requires" that one of the two grievants be selected for the supervisor position and that this, in turn, requires the military to select one of the grievants for a military supervisory position--despite the Agency's claim that the military finds neither of the grievants "acceptable to the military chain of command."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The premise of the Agency's contentions--that the award requires the military to select one of the two grievants for a military supervisory position--is incorrect. The award leaves the Agency the option of not promoting either grievant, as long as the selecting official provides a "full justification as to why a selection was not made." Therefore, the Agency's contentions are based upon a misinterpretation of the award, and we deny this portion of the Agency's contrary-to-law exception on that basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an agency policy and a contract provision appear to govern a grievance concerning the filling of a supervisory vacancy, FLRA sustains an award that rests on interpretation of the contract, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 200 and Dept. of Transp., FAA, Atlantic City</span>, 68 FLRA 549, 550 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority case law, an agency's selections and selection procedures for filling non-bargaining-unit positions are not subject to the parties' negotiated grievance procedures unless the agency has elected to agree to their coverage.[9] Consequently, the grievability of <span id="page_2098"></span>disputes over the filling of supervisory positions is a matter of contract interpretation.[10] The Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the parties had not agreed to the grievability of such disputes.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, an award may be deficient if it is inconsistent with a governing agency regulation.[11] But where an agency regulation and an agreement both apply to the framed issue, the parties' agreement will govern the dispute.[12] In this case, the Arbitrator based her award on the language in the parties' agreement.[13] Thus, even assuming that the manual is relevant, the parties' agreement governs the disposition of this matter.[14] Any alleged inconsistency between the Agency policy and the award does not provide a basis for vacating the award because the award is based on the parties' agreement. Thus, the Union's exception does not provide a basis for finding the award contrary to the Agency policy.</p>

Under Authority case law, an agency's selections and selection procedures for filling nonbargaining unit positions are not subject to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure unless the agency has elected in negotiations to agree to their coverage. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R1-109, </span>61 FLRA 588, 590-91 (2006); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 25 FLRA 1067, 1079 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other matters</span>, 848 F.2d 1273 (D.C. Cir. 1988). This longstanding precedent also applies to supervisory or managerial positions filled on a temporary basis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1012 v. FLRA</span>, 841 F.2d 1165, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (proposal concerning the filling of supervisory positions, including temporary appointments, is negotiable only at the election of the agency). Consequently, the grievability of disputes over the filling of supervisory positions is ultimately a question of contract interpretation, not law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's resolution of the grievability question in this case is consistent with Authority precedent. It is undisputed that the supervisory positions whose filling the Union challenged in its grievance are outside the bargaining unit. Moreover, the Union does not take issue with the Arbitrator's finding that there is "no evidence" that the Agency had elected to make the filling of the contested positions subject to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. Therefore, the Arbitrator's conclusion, that the Union's grievance is not subject to the negotiated grievance procedure and is not arbitrable, is consistent with Authority case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case law on which the Union relies does not apply.&#x2003;The cases cited by the Union discuss whether former bargaining unit employees may, consistent with the terms of applicable collective bargaining agreements, grieve an action taken while they were members of the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Firefighters</span>, 43 FLRA at 1024 (past and present employees entitled under the terms of the contract to pursue grievance regarding overtime pay); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 26 FLRA at 293 (grievance of former bargaining unit employee arbitrable under terms of the contract).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases have no application here.&#x2003;There is no issue in this case concerning the grievance rights of former unit employees; i.e., the employees who were chosen to fill the supervisory positions in dispute. Rather, the grievance was filed by the Union. Moreover, the grievance was filed to vindicate the interests of current unit employees, not the former unit employees who had moved to positions outside the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the principle that the Arbitrator relied on is not addressed by these cases. Specifically, the Arbitrator's substantive arbitrability ruling hinged on the Arbitrator's finding that the parties' negotiated grievance procedure did not cover the filling of the supervisory positions at issue. This subject is not addressed by the Authority decisions on which the Union relies. Therefore, the case law on which the Union relies is inapposite, and does not provide any basis for finding that the award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1667 and VAMC Brooklyn</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-27.html">70 FLRA 155</a>, 156-58 (2016), the arbitrator was upheld when he found no basis in the contract to sustain a grievance protesting nonselection for a supervisory position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that, under the parties' agreement, the term "grievance" did not include grievances alleging errors in the selection process for a non-bargaining-unit position. As such, the Union challenges the Arbitrator's substantive-arbitrability determination.[16] An arbitrator's determination regarding substantive arbitrability under the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement is ordinarily subject to the deferential essence standard outlined above.[17] However, in certain situations, the Authority reviews an arbitrator's interpretation of contract provisions <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. This includes situations where the contract provision's language "mirrors"--is similar or identical to--statutory language, and in addition, where one party asserts, and the other party does not dispute, that the parties intended that the contract provision be interpreted in the same manner as the statutory provision.[18][19]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;Member Pizzella does not agree with majority's assertion that the Authority requires more than language that mirrors a statute in order to conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of language in the parties' agreement that mirrors a statute. Although Member Pizzella agrees that the suggestion by one party, with the acquiescence of the other, that the language mirrors a statute may be sufficient for a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Authority, it is not necessary. The Authority itself has analyzed whether language of an agreement mirrors a statute without the suggestion of any party and independent of any arbitrator finding. <span class="Italic">Local 2128</span>, 66 FLRA at 803 ("Moreover, the wording of Articles 37 and 38 of the parties' agreement does not mirror 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121."); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 64 FLRA 599, 600 (2010) (applying <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review where sections of parties' agreement are "virtually identical" to the Statute). Where, as here, the words of the parties' agreement uses the exact language of a statute--also known as mirroring a statute--Authority precedent does not require anything further in order to apply a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of that language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union alleges that the Arbitrator erred when she interpreted the term "grievance" to not include complaints about "failures in the process as applied in filling a non-unit position." Specifically, the Union argues that "[s]ince [a] violation of law is being alleged in this complaint...the Union has the absolute right to challenge the fairness of the process" and "arbitrators chosen to hear such cases indeed are empowered by the Statute to rectify complaints." Article 43, Section 2 defines what qualifies as a grievance under the parties' agreement. The Union alleges, and there is no dispute, that this language "is derived from" the language of the Statute.[23] Because of the similarity in wording, and the Union's undisputed claim that the parties intended that the contract provision be interpreted in the same manner as the statutory provision, we review the Arbitrator's interpretation of the term "grievance" in Article 43, Section 2 <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority case law, an agency's selections and selection procedures for filling non-bargaining-unit positions are not subject to the parties' negotiated grievance procedure unless the agency has elected to agree to their coverage.[25] Therefore, the general grievance language found in Article 43 does not itself indicate that the Agency elected to such coverage, and we must look to other language within the parties' agreement to determine whether the Agency so elected. Because we must look outside language that mirrors the Statute, we defer to the Arbitrator's interpretation of whether the Agency elected to include this matter in the negotiated grievance procedure unless the Union can demonstrate that the Arbitrator's interpretation fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Interpreting the parties' agreement, the Arbitrator found that the agreement does not cover the process of promotions to non-bargaining-unit positions "by any aspect" and that the Union's grievance "[did] not implicate any specific provision[ ] of the" agreement. Although the Union argues that the Arbitrator erred "with her assertion that the failures [by the Agency]...do not implicate...specific provision[s] of the" agreement, the Union does not challenge the Arbitrator's interpretation other than her interpretation of the general definition of "grievance" set forth in Article 43. Therefore, the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator's interpretation--that the Agency did not elect to include the selections and selection procedures for filling non-bargaining-unit positions within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure--fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.[29] Consequently, we deny this exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union asserts that the Authority has held that "agencies can agree to include promotion to non-bargaining unit jobs in the bargaining agreement's grievance and arbitration procedure," and that the Agency has done so in this case. The Authority has held that the grievability of disputes over the filling of non-bargaining unit positions is a matter of contract interpretation.[26] Here, the Arbitrator found that the parties had not negotiated to include nonselection for non&#8209;bargaining unit positions in their negotiated grievance procedure, a finding that the Union does not challenge. Consequently, the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred, as a matter of law, in finding that the parties had not agreed to include such disputes in their negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
