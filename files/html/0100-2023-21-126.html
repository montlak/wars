<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-125"><span class="space">a.</span> Consent by Current Spouse to Discontinue Survivor Annuity</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lawson v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 672, 675-76 (1995), described the procedure for discontinuing an election for a spousal survivor annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party who asserts entitlement to retirement benefits bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that he meets the applicable criteria for such entitlement.&#8197;...The applicable law provides in relevant part that the annuity computed for an employee who is married at the time of retirement is reduced in order to provide a survivor annuity for the employee's spouse, unless the employee and the spouse jointly waive the spouse's right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with OPM in accordance with such requirements prescribed by OPM regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1). Here, the appellant contended below that he was entitled to change his survivor benefit election, which would have resulted in an increase in the amount of his annuity payments. Thus, the appellant was required to show that he met the criteria for amending his survivor benefit election. An amendment of a survivor benefit election must be made not later than 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly annuity payment, must be in writing, and must be accompanied by evidence of spousal consent or justification for waiver of spousal consent, if applicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant was entitled to change his survivor benefit election, the administrative judge found credible the appellant's testimony and sworn statement that: His employing agency, the Department of the Navy had advised him to address all correspondence concerning his retirement to OPM's Boyers, Pennsylvania address, and, consistent with that advice, on June 1, 1994, he mailed to OPM's Boyers address a request for a form to cancel his survivor benefit election; he sought to cancel his survivor benefit election after he learned that his spouse, Sandra Lawson, had allegedly forged his name on documents to receive funds and that, as a result, he and his spouse separated and she agreed to sign a spousal consent form; and he received no response from OPM to his June 1, 1994 request (which OPM asserted that it never received), causing him, on December 6, 1994, to mail copies of another request (the only request that OPM stated it received) to OPM's addresses in both Boyers and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the administrative judge found, based on her unchallenged credibility determination, that the appellant timely notified OPM that he desired to change his survivor benefit election, she did not determine that the appellant provided the requisite joint spousal consent or justification for waiver of such consent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1). Further, while the appellant alleged that his spouse agreed to consent to the new election, there is no evidence of record that the appellant received his spouse's consent or that he demonstrated justification for a waiver of her consent. Therefore, this case must be remanded to afford the appellant the opportunity to submit the joint spousal consent or justification for waiver of such consent and the administrative judge must determine whether such submission satisfies the requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case must also be remanded to permit the appellant's spouse an opportunity to intervene in the appeal. The Board may permit parties to intervene in a Board proceeding where the proceeding or its outcome will affect them directly and where intervention is otherwise appropriate under law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(a); <span class="Italic">see also Baugh v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 58, 63 (1991). Here, because Sandra Lawson was the designated beneficiary of the appellant's survivor annuity, her entitlement to that benefit would be directly affected by the Board's decision, and the interest of justice would be served by permitting her to intervene and present relevant evidence. Thus, her intervention is appropriate under law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Merel v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-13-0383-I-1 (NP 7/11/2014), stated of survivor annuity amendments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4262"></span>...An amendment of a survivor benefit election must be made not later than 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly annuity payment, must be in writing, and must be accompanied by evidence of spousal consent or justification for waiver of spousal consent, if applicable.

Because the appellant's retirement application reflects that she originally elected a maximum survivor annuity, the appellant bears the burden of demonstrating that she filed a timely request to change this election. <span class="Italic">Lawson</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 672, 675; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has submitted no evidence demonstrating that she filed a timely request to change her survivor annuity election with either OPM or her former employing agency, and the appellant has presented no argument on review challenging or undermining this finding. As the administrative judge correctly noted, moreover, the date the form was either signed or notarized does not evidence the date of its filing with either OPM or her former employer. For this same reason, we find unavailing the appellant's argument on review that, under California law, the date a document is notarized does not have to be the same date it was signed. Regardless of when the form was either signed or notarized, there is no evidence in the record reflecting when, if ever, the appellant submitted the form to OPM or her former employer. The appellant, moreover, does not have a statutory right to notice that she must file a request to change an election of annuity benefits within 30 days of her receipt of her first regular monthly annuity payment, and we find the absence of any such notice does not affect the period of time she had to request such a change under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 77, 80-81 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no requirement that OPM provide notice of the 30-day period to revoke a survivor annuity election within 30 days of the first regular monthly payment. <span class="Italic">Perez Peraza v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 457, 459-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-14, 2010 MSPB 152 (2010), remanded the appeal to determine whether equitable estoppel could prevent application of the 30-day deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRS, the surviving spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the retiree's annuity unless the survivor consented in writing to receive no such survivor annuity or a reduced annuity at the time of the employee's retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Luten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. OPM has promulgated implementing regulations that provide a 30-day window, after the retiree's receipt of the first regular monthly annuity payment, in which the retiree "may name a new survivor or change his election of type of annuity" by filing a new written election, with spousal consent, if applicable. <span class="Italic">Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621. The relevant statute and regulations also provide that a retiree may, within 18 months after retirement, choose to elect a survivor annuity for the spouse to whom he was married at retirement if he did not previously do so or to increase the size of such an annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(o)(1); <span class="Italic">Nunes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2009); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 77, 79 (1996); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(b)(1). However, the retiree "may not revoke or change the [survivor annuity] election or name another survivor later than 30 days after the date of the first regular monthly payment" with certain exceptions not relevant here. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(a); <span class="Italic">see Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 80.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, it is undisputed that the appellant received his first regular monthly annuity payment on June 1, 2007, and made his request to revoke his spousal survivor annuity election on July 1, 2008. His request was filed 1 year after the 30-day deadline had elapsed and was, therefore, untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, has recognized three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (1) the statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (2) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel; and (3) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline, where such notice is required by statute or regulation, may warrant a waiver of the deadline. <span class="Italic">Scriffiny v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 6 (2008), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Nunes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Blaha</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), <span class="Italic">and modified by Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 602, 606 n.4 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the administrative judge correctly held that neither basis (1), nor (3), for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation is applicable. That is, the relevant statute and regulations do not provide for waiver, and OPM did not fail to provide a required notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline. The dispositive issue, therefore, is whether the appellant established basis (2), equitable estoppel, in order to waive the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reviewing court has held that "affirmative misconduct is a prerequisite for invoking equitable estoppel against the government[.] " <span class="Italic">Zacharin v. United States,</span> 213 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In addition, to invoke equitable estoppel against the government, the party claiming estoppel must have reasonably relied on the other party's misrepresentation to his detriment. <span class="Italic">See Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 51, 59 (1984). Thus, there are two elements that must be shown to prove a claim of equitable estoppel, affirmative misconduct and reasonable reliance on that misconduct.<span class="Italic"> See Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant averred that he and his wife spoke with the SSA Benefits Specialist three times in order to understand if and when he could revoke his election of a survivor annuity for his spouse. He further stated that the SSA official assured them each time that he had an 18-month period in which to effect a revocation. In addition, the appellant stated three separate OPM officials to whom they spoke said he had 18 months to revoke the annuity election. The undisputed evidence establishes that the appellant was misinformed by SSA and OPM officials. However, the appellant did not allege or present evidence to show that the officials who provided misinformation to him knew that the statements they made were inaccurate. The Board has held that negligent provision of misinformation does not constitute affirmative misconduct. <span class="Italic">Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Scriffiny,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 378, &#x00B6; 12 (adopting the rule stated by the First, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal). Therefore, the administrative judge erred in applying equitable estoppel, because the evidence did not show that the relevant government officials in this case knew they were providing the appellant with inaccurate information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as in <span class="Italic">Nunes</span> and <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> the parties in this appeal were never informed of the correct standard for establishing equitable estoppel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11. Indeed, during the prehearing conference, the administrative judge who was initially assigned to this case directed the appellant to explain "who provided him with incorrect information concerning the deadline for canceling his election, what they specifically told him, and when. The administrative judge directed OPM's representative to submit evidence "which would show exactly what information the appellant was provided concerning his right to cancel his survivor election, and the time limits for doing so." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, it appears that the administrative judge may have inadvertently misled the appellant into believing that he could prevail merely by showing that government officials gave him incorrect information on which he relied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, while the initial decision explained that, to prevail on a waiver request based on equitable estoppel, the appellant must demonstrate that the actions of the relevant government officials constituted affirmative misconduct, the initial decision did not explain that, under <span class="Italic">Scriffiny,</span> the provision of incorrect information by agency officials does not qualify as affirmative misconduct absent evidence that the officials knew the information they provided was incorrect. Therefore, it appears that the appellant was unaware that, to prevail on an equitable estoppel claim, he was required to show that government officials knowingly provided him with incorrect information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, it is necessary to remand this appeal for further adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11. On remand, the administrative judge should inform the parties of the legal standard for establishing equitable estoppel and afford them an opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding the application of that doctrine. The parties should address whether the misinformation provided by the relevant government officials was knowing, and, thus, affirmative misconduct, or mere negligence. <span class="Italic">Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, to prevail under the doctrine of equitable estoppel on remand, the appellant must show not only that there was affirmative misconduct, but also that he acted reasonably in relying on the misinformation that he received. <span class="Italic">Nunes,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Blaha,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 11. For reliance on another's affirmative misconduct to be reasonable reliance, the party claiming estoppel must show that he did not know nor should he have known that the information provided to him was inaccurate and misleading. <span class="Italic">See Heckler,</span> 467 U.S. at 59.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If, at the time when he acted, such party had knowledge of the truth, or had the means by which with reasonable diligence he could acquire the knowledge so that it would be negligence on his part to remain ignorant by not using those means, he cannot claim to have been misled by relying upon the representation or concealment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.,</span> n.10 (quoting 3 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence &#x00A7; 810 at 219). On remand, the parties should address whether the appellant acted reasonably given the information available to him, including the instructions accompanying his retirement application, and the CSRS/Federal Employees Retirement System Handbook provided to him by the SSA Benefits Specialist. We note that one of the appellant's submissions indicates that it was because of having read "a clause implying that the changes allowable out to 18 months only included increasing the <span id="Page_4263"></span>survivor benefit" that he questioned the SSA Benefits Specialist further.</p>
