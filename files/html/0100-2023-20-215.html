<p class="Body-Text">The evidentiary weight, and burdens of proof, relative to agency treatment of employees in comparison to the appellant in whistleblowing motivational analysis under <span class="Italic">Carr was summarized by Chaudhuri v. VA</span>, DA-1221-14-0553-W-2 (NP 3/2/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor, however, the administrative judge appeared to have placed the burden of proof on the appellant, rather than on the agency where it belongs. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1261 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In fact, the agency did not present any specific evidence in support of the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carr</span> <span id="Page_4016"></span>does not impose an affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence as to each of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors to weigh them individually in the agency's favor, and the absence of any evidence relating to the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor can effectively remove that factor from the analysis. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2012). However, "the Government's failure to produce evidence on this factor 'may be at the agency's peril,' considering the Government's advantage in accessing this type of evidence." <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comparator analysis--<span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3--was considered in<span class="Italic"> Siler v. EPA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20181113116">908 F.3d 1291</a>, 1298-99 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider the Board's decision that the EPA would still have removed Mr. Siler had he not engaged in whistleblowing. Whistleblower retaliation is an affirmative defense. Where, as here, the government does not dispute that whistleblowing contributed to the agency's decision to take adverse personnel action against an employee, the agency must prove it would have taken the same action absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). Under <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, the Board considers (1) "the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action"; (2) "the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials who were involved in the decision"; and (3) "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated" in deciding whether the agency has met that burden. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323. If the agency fails to prove that it would have taken the same action absent whistleblowing, the Board must set aside the agency's penalty decision and order corrective action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B) (stating that "the agency's decision may not be sustained...if the employee...shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (defining whistleblower retaliation as a "prohibited personnel practice"). The Board has no discretion to affirm a penalty tainted by illegal reprisal, even if the agency's penalty might otherwise have been reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Nies, J., concurring) ("In an adverse action proceeding,...the merits cannot be the determinative factor that there was no reprisal. A <span class="Italic">meritorious adverse action must be set aside where there is reprisal</span>." (emphasis added)). Here, Mr. Siler challenges the Board's treatment of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors 3 and 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Carr Factor 3</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors challenge the agency to prove that its employee would have been punished notwithstanding any whistleblowing. Thus, <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 examines the agency's treatment of non-whistleblower employees accused of similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323. The Board found that this factor favored the agency. It considered two potential comparators--SAC Ashe and a Dallas employee removed for using government equipment to view child pornography--but it found neither sufficiently similar to make a "meaningful comparison." Instead, it found "most telling" that the agency did not retaliate against other whistleblowers who offered testimony against SAC Ashe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the other Ashe whistleblowers, the Board erred. The third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor looks at "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are <span class="Italic">not whistleblowers</span> but who are <span class="Italic">otherwise similarly situated</span>." <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1262 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (emphases added) (quoting <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1323). Though the agency's treatment of other whistleblowers may illuminate any motive to retaliate under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 2, it does not show the agency's treatment of non-whistleblower employees accused of similar misconduct, the precise inquiry considered under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also erred in finding that the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor favored the government. Once a whistleblower shows that his protected disclosures contributed to adverse action against him, the agency bears the burden of showing that it would have acted in the same way even absent any whistleblowing. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1257 (burdening the agency to prove independent causation by clear and convincing evidence). Though an agency need not introduce evidence of every <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor to prove its case, the "risk associated with having no evidence on the record" for a particular factor falls on the government. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d 1262. The Board "may not simply guess what might happen absent whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It follows that where, as here, the Board finds an absence of relevant comparator evidence, the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor cannot favor the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore vacate the Board's decision and remand for further consideration of the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors. Though we do not disturb the Board's fact findings, on remand, the Board should provide sufficient explanation for its conclusion that SAC Ashe and Mr. Siler may not be meaningfully compared. While the precise wrongdoings by SAC Ashe and Mr. Siler differ, both men engaged in a pattern of offenses and the same deciding official disciplined both men for "conduct unbecoming." We remind the Board that "[d]ifferences in kinds and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for to arrive at a well reasoned conclusion regarding <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three." <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Dept. of Labor,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20120530164">680 F.3d 1353</a>, 1372-75 (Fed. Cir. 2012), cited in <span class="Italic">Siler,</span> was critical of the Board's restrictive view of comparator evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent Finkel's testimony concerning other actions by OSHA officials, the AJ had only Dubois's conduct for comparison to Whitmore's. Whitmore was removed, whereas Dubois faced no disciplinary action. Under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, which inquires as to "any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated," the AJ believed that Dubois was not similarly situated to Whitmore since Whitmore was the instigator and the one who had threatened physical violence. A22; <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323. Thus, no meaningful comparison between the action taken against Whitmore and the lack of action against Dubois was made in evaluating Whitmore's whistleblower defense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Board precedent under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three takes a narrow view of what it means for employees to be "similarly situated." "For other employees to be deemed similarly situated, the Board has held that all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be 'nearly identical' to those of the comparative employees." <span class="Italic">Spahn v. DOJ</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, 202 (2003). Regarding the employees' conduct, two employees are not similarly situated if there are "differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their misconduct or the appropriate discipline for it." <span class="Italic">Godesky v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 280, 285-86 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot endorse the highly restrictive view of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three adopted by the AJ in this case. One can always identify characteristics that differ between two persons to show that their positions are not "nearly identical," or to distinguish their conduct in some fashion. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> however, requires the comparison employees to be "similarly situated"--not identically situated--to the whistleblower. To read <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three so narrowly as to require virtual identity before the issue of similarly situated non-whistleblowers is ever implicated effectively reads this factor out of our precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dubois and Whitmore were both in supervisory positions within the same branch of the same department at OSHA. They even operated within the same chain of command. Whitmore and Dubois were similarly situated from an employment position and responsibility perspective. <span class="Italic">Compare with Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1327 ("[T]he 'support' staff employees of the New Haven hearing office were not similarly situated to Ms. Carr. Significantly, those employees and the ALJs were supervised under separate chains of command. More importantly, as an ALJ, Ms. Carr held a position of trust and responsibility that was entirely different from the positions of the employees who made complaints about her.") (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In terms of their conduct, regardless of who initiated or escalated the various altercations, the record supports that both Whitmore and Dubois engaged in the same inappropriate and unprofessional conduct and hostility to large degree. The ultimate conditional threat of violence made by Whitmore certainly distinguishes the two, but for the most part Dubois's conduct could well be considered the very same kind of disruptive and intimidating behavior, conduct unbecoming a supervisor, and inappropriate conduct in the workplace for which Whitmore was charged. Dubois yelled, spat, and was openly hostile to Whitmore. Dubois also participated in perpetuating argumentative email threads between himself and Whitmore, copying uninvolved OSHA officials. To the extent Whitmore's conduct was the same as Dubois's, but was more frequent, serious, or unprofessional as a matter of degree, any meaningful <span class="Italic">overall</span> comparison also would have had to weigh the evidence in the record suggesting that Dubois was maliciously tampering with Whitmore's leave totals. Without weighing the evidence ourselves, we simply illustrate that a meaningful comparison between the conduct of Whitmore and Dubois can be made, but was not made in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of examining <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, the requisite degree of similarity between employees cannot be construed so narrowly that the only evidence helpful to the inquiry is completely disregarded. Differences in kinds and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for to arrive at a well reasoned conclusion regarding <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, particularly where, as here, there was only a single person in the record for which a comparison can be made (Finkel's testimony having been excluded). Despite ultimately finding no evidence of similarly situated non-whistleblowers, even the AJ found Whitmore's contentions concerning Dubois's lack of any disciplinary action to be his "strongest argument in support of his affirmative defense." Yet by deeming Dubois not "similarly situated," the AJ did not examine how the disparity in treatment between Whitmore and Dubois should inform the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The whistleblower statute is clear that even where the charges have been sustained and the agency's chosen penalty is deemed reasonable, the agency must still prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would <span id="Page_4017"></span>have imposed the <span class="Italic">exact same penalty</span> in the absence of the protected disclosures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e) (providing that the agency must prove it would have taken "the <span class="Italic">same personnel action</span> in the absence of such disclosure") (emphasis added). Perhaps the most helpful inquiry in making this determination is <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, and its importance and utility should not be marginalized by reading it so narrowly as to eliminate it as a helpful analytical tool.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be clear, <span class="Italic">Carr</span> does not impose an affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence with respect to each and every one of the three <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors to weigh them each individually in the agency's favor. The factors are merely appropriate and pertinent considerations for determining whether the agency carries its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the same action would have been taken absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Carr,</span> 185 F.3d at 1323; <span class="Italic">see Kalil v. U.S.D.A.,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071300479f3d82111300">479 F.3d 821</a>, 824 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting that "the [B]oard in <span class="Italic">Geyer,</span> identified several factors that <span class="Italic">may be considered,</span> including [the <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors].") (emphasis added, internal citation omitted). Indeed, the absence of any evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three can effectively remove that factor from the analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McCarthy v. Int'l Boundary and Water Comm.: U.S. &#x0026; Mexico,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 594, 626 (2011) (finding no evidence of the agency taking similar actions against similarly situated nonwhistleblowers, and therefore concluding that "the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is not a significant factor for the Board's analysis in the instant appeal"); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 4, 13-14 (2003) (finding that whistleblower was lawfully removed based on the evidence under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factors one and two, where the record contained no evidence of action taken against similarly situated non-whistleblowers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent such evidence exists, however, the agency is required to come forward with all reasonably pertinent evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three. Failure to do so may be at the agency's peril. As a practical matter, the agency has far greater access to and control over evidence of prior disciplinary action taken against its employees than a whistleblower-employee typically does. The agency should liberally produce this evidence not only because any such evidence in its possession is plainly relevant and discoverable, but also to help the agency carry its overall burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the personnel action taken against the whistleblower would have been taken regardless of the whistleblowing. Stated differently, the absence of any evidence concerning <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three may well cause the agency to fail to prove its case overall. <span class="Italic">See Chambers,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. at 88 (finding that "we are simply not left with a 'definite and firm conviction' that the agency would have taken any action based on the sustained charges in the absence of her protected disclosures" in large part because the agency "did not show that it took similar actions against similarly-situated non-whistleblowers"); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 610, 621 (2002) ("[A]lthough the Board of Investigation report provided agency officials with evidence to support taking some disciplinary action against the appellants, this factor is far outweighed by the strong motive to retaliate by agency officials who were involved in these disciplinary actions and the lack of evidence showing that the agency took similar actions against otherwise similarly-situated non-whistleblowers.");<span class="Italic"> Russell v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 327-328 (M.S.P.B. 1997) ("Weighing the three factors..., we find that although the reporting officials had strong evidence to support their reports concerning the appellant, this factor is far outweighed by their strong motive to retaliate and the lack of any evidence showing that they treated non-whistleblower employees the same way they treated the appellant.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ must reconsider the evidence surrounding Dubois's conduct and lack of any repercussions, along with the testimony of Dr. Finkel, in a manner consistent with the scope of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three as expressed herein.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The record evidence demonstrates that during the AIB investigation, Dr. Patel was asked about previous assistants that he did not consider "good assistants."

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Similarly situated" employees can be those with similar job status, duties, responsibilities, years of service--but who were not whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore,</span> 680 F.3d at 1373 (comparing two individuals that were "both in supervisory positions within the same branch of the same department," "operated within the same chain of command," and were similar "from an employment position and responsibility perspective").

<p class="Block-Quote1">The VA cites to <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span> in support of its contention that it did not need to provide evidence as to Carr factor three; rather a lack of evidence as to that factor would "effectively remove [the factor] from the analysis."

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Whitmore,</span> the Board did not conduct a comparator analysis because it believed the only comparable employee, Mr. Dubois, was not similarly situated to Mr. Whitmore, because Mr. Dubois, unlike Mr. Whitmore, was not the instigator or the one who threatened physical violence. <span class="Italic">Whitmore,</span> 680 F.3d at 1372.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board should have considered the agency's failure to introduce evidence relevant to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3--treatment of non-whistleblowers who engaged in similar misconduct. Though Mr. Smith was punished for working over a weekend, the undisputed record indicates at least one of Mr. Smith's colleagues completed weekend work on the same weekend as Mr. Smith. But the record does not reflect whether that colleague was penalized in any way. To the extent the agency failed to introduce evidence on how this employee or other similarly situated employees were treated, <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 cannot support the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Siler</span>, 908 F.3d at 1299 (holding that where there is "an absence of relevant comparator evidence, the third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor cannot favor the government"); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1262 ("[t]he court may not simply guess what might happen absent whistleblowing.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency here submitted evidence showing that it removed four employees between August 2016 and July 2018 for attendance-related charges. Three of those removals involved substantially longer periods of absence than the appellant accumulated. There is no evidence in the <span id="Page_4018"></span>record to explain why the agency decided to propose removal against the appellant after 2 1/2 weeks of unexcused absence but waited 7 weeks to propose removal for another, and nearly a full year to propose removal for yet another employee. The record shows that the agency treated the appellant differently, but does not show the reason for the difference in treatment. Having submitted evidence concerning how it treated other employees, the agency took a risk in failing to fully explain the context of that evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Siler v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 908 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (stating that the "risk associated with having no evidence on the record" for a particular factor falls on the Government (quoting <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1262)); <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1262 (stating that the Government's failure to produce evidence on this factor "may be at the agency's peril" considering the Government's advantage in accessing this type of evidence (quoting <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374)); <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374 (holding that, to the extent evidence on <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 exists, "the agency is required to come forward with all reasonably pertinent evidence"; the "[f]ailure to do so may be at the agency's peril"). We find, therefore, that <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor 3 weighs against the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rickel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 F.4th 1358, 1364-66 (Fed. Cir. 2022), suggested that the burden is on the appellant to produce specific evidence of comparators who are not whistleblowers but whose circumstances are similar to those of the disciplined appellant, and the decision stated, or reiterated from earlier decisions, that "<span class="Italic">Carr</span> imposes no affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence for each of the three factors":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, the Board "examines the agency's treatment of non-whistleblower employees accused of similar misconduct." <span class="Italic">Siler v. EPA</span>, 908 F.3d 1291, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2018). "The third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor looks at 'any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are <span class="Italic">not whistleblowers</span> but who are <span class="Italic">otherwise similarly situated</span>.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1262). Here, Captain Weiss's testimony does not address or identify any employee who engaged in misconduct similar to Mr. Rickel's. Rather, Captain Weiss testified that he was unaware of an employee who had engaged in similar conduct and whom the agency had terminated. In the absence of other record evidence, such testimony suggests only that there is no record evidence regarding whether the agency has taken similar actions with respect to employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Ingram v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 777 F. App'x 980, 983-84 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ("Though the absence of evidence regarding similarly situated employees cannot favor the government, 'the absence of any evidence relating to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three can effectively remove that factor from the analysis.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374) (citing <span class="Italic">Siler</span>, 908 F.3d at 1299)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, "[f]or an employee to be considered similarly situated to an individual who is disciplined, it must be shown that <span class="Italic">the conduct and the circumstances surrounding the conduct of the comparison employee</span> are similar to those of the disciplined individual." <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326-27 (emphasis added). So, here, there would need to be some evidence tying Captain Weiss's testimony to an actual employee and, more specifically, to a comparison employee that had engaged in misconduct similar to Mr. Rickel's. Even if Captain Weiss's testimony did suggest that no employee has been disciplined in a similar manner to Mr. Rickel, this does not lay the foundation for establishing that a comparison employee exists. <span class="Italic">See Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1373-74 ("Differences in kind and degrees of conduct between otherwise similarly situated persons within an agency can and should be accounted for to arrive at a well reasoned conclusion regarding <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, particularly where, as here, there was only a single person in the record for which a comparison can be made...."). And no such evidence otherwise exists in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rickel also argues that, "[i]n a case such as this, where all officials involved in removal are found to have to some extent an improper motive to remove the employee, and at least one has a 'stronger' improper motive[,]...justice and a furtherance of the intent of Congress requires that an agency provide some degree of evidence as to <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three, not that it be wholly ignored." In other words, Mr. Rickel asserts that we "should create a bright-line rule" requiring the agency to "produce[ ] some evidence in support of <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor three" to meet its burden in removal cases where the Board finds that there is "some motivation to retaliate against the [removed] employee, and one or more [of the decision makers] has more than a 'weak' motive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We decline to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third <span class="Italic">Carr</span> factor is one of "three nonexclusive factors" the Board considers when evaluating whether an agency has "show[n] by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken 'the same personnel action in the absence of [a protected] disclosure." <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 930 F.3d at 1365 (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). These "factors are merely appropriate and pertinent considerations for determining whether the agency" has carried this burden. <span class="Italic">Whitmore</span>, 680 F.3d at 1374. But, as we have repeatedly explained, "<span class="Italic">Carr</span> imposes no affirmative burden on the agency to produce evidence for each of the three factors." <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 930 F.3d at 1366; <span class="Italic">see also Staley v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., No. 2020-2127, 2021 WL 2965007, at *2 (Fed. Cir. July 15, 2021) ("An agency is not required to produce evidence with respect to each and every one of these factors."). The proper inquiry still remains whether the agency would have taken the same action, absent the whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 930 F.3d at 1366; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 842 F.3d at 1257 ("The issue...is whether substantial evidence supports the Board's determination that the [agency] showed independent causation by clear and convincing evidence."); <span class="Italic">Ingram</span>, 777 F. App'x at 983 ("<span class="Italic">Carr</span> does not require that each of the three factors individually weigh in favor of the agency."). Indeed, we have repeatedly stated that the agency "need not produce evidence with regard to each of the[ ] factors, nor must each factor weigh in favor of the agency for [it] to carry its burden." <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

Yet, the AJ then found that none of the employees engaged in both the use of vulgar language <span class="Italic">and</span> lack of candor, and none threatened to disrupt production.

As noted by the agency, the CFO and the appellant did not engage in similar conduct, did not occupy similar positions, and did not work in the same state, and different departments handled the investigations into their misconduct. The appellant has not shown any similarities between the two individuals, and we discern no basis to conclude that they are similarly situated for the purpose of a <span class="Italic">Carr</span>-factor analysis simply because they both worked for the Forest Service and were both investigated for misconduct at around the same time. Accordingly, we modify the remand initial decision to find that the CFO was not similarly situated to the appellant.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that the agency treated him more harshly than another pharmacist with whom he had engaged in an altercation.[7] In considering the discipline imposed in response to the altercation with the other pharmacist, the administrative judge noted the testimony of the appellant's first-line supervisor that she verbally counseled the other pharmacist but that she treated this employee less harshly than the appellant because she was unaware of other misconduct in which that pharmacist had engaged and because the other pharmacist had worked at the agency for a long time. We agree with the administrative judge that this employee was not similarly situated to the appellant given that she was a tenured employee.

Nevertheless, there is a vast difference between probationary employees and permanent employees, not least of which is that they are subject to different standards governing discipline. Permanent employees can only be disciplined for reasons that promote the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503(a), 7513(a). If a permanent employee is disciplined, he has the right to appeal adverse actions to the Board, provided he meets the statutory definition of "employee" set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). There is no statute containing standards governing the discipline of probationers and, therefore, no limits on an agency's discretion in this area so long as the agency's action does not violate some other statute, such as one of the anti-discrimination statutes or the Whistleblower Protection Act. In other words, an agency can terminate a probationary employee for any reason or no reason, so long as that reason is not an illegal reason. A prudent agency, therefore, ensures that it has amassed sufficient evidence to support its case, is careful to provide due process rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution, and affords a tenured employee the procedural rights set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and any other law, rule, regulation, or union contract that might be applicable in a particular case. A probationer is entitled to none of these things. Because an agency does not need a reason to terminate a probationer, it need not collect any evidence or prepare itself to prove anything, although it would be prudent to do so in most cases. The fact that the law permits the agency to terminate the appellant's employment during his probationary period for any reason that is not illegal means that he is not similarly situated to permanent employees, who can only be removed for reasons that promote the efficiency of the service.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Government took an exceedingly narrow approach in addressing this factor. The Warden's testimony shows there to be a lack of similarly situated nonwhistleblowers only at the Beaumont prison facility working on the Warden's four-member executive staff specifically and only during his tenure there. The Government introduced no evidence as to what actions it takes against other DOJ employees during OIG investigations despite this factor being directed to the "agency" rather than to a particular supervisor at a particular Federal Bureau of Prisons facility. It may be the case that the DOJ transfers employees pending investigation by OIG with some regularity, but the Government has put forward no evidence of that here. The Government provided no evidence that the treatment of Mr. Miller is comparable to similarly situated employees who are not whistleblowers, and the court may not simply guess what might happen absent whistleblowing.

<p class="Body-Text">A comparator was considered in <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. DOD</span>, 479 Fed. Appx. 341, 343-44 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), discounting the similarity between the conduct of the appellant and the comparator and determining that the agency established its right to impose a short disciplinary suspension for discourteous email traffic by clear and convincing evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the board's decision upholding the agency's decision to suspend Pedeleose is supported by substantial evidence and should be affirmed. Once an employee demonstrates that a disclosure protected by the WPA was a contributing factor in an agency's decision to take an adverse personnel action, the burden shifts to the agency to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action even in the absence of the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Marano v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Here, as the board correctly determined, the DCMA carried its burden of establishing that it would have suspended Pedeleose even absent any protected disclosure. The record demonstrates that Pedeleose repeatedly sent rude and disrespectful emails to his supervisors and other individuals in his chain of command. He accused Blake, a DCMA commander, of being untrustworthy, and told Woodlief, his group's lead systems engineer, to "mind [his] own business." In addition, Pedeleose sent an email to Nelson, his immediate supervisor, in which he asserted that her actions were "way over the line" and that she had lied about her motives for sending him the letter asking him to send his reports to her before he distributed them to others. Given the angry and disrespectful tone and content of Pedeleose's emails, the agency had ample justification for imposing a one-day suspension. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (concluding that disciplinary action was appropriate where the "strong evidence" of an employee's misconduct far outweighed the presence of a retaliatory motive on the part of the employee's supervisors).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA is designed to encourage the disclosure of government wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The statute is not, however, intended "to protect employees from their own misconduct." <span class="Italic">Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1326; <span class="Italic">see also Greenspan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 464 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (emphasizing that "wrongful or disruptive conduct is not shielded by the presence of a protected disclosure"). Where, as here, an agency produces clear and convincing evidence that it would have undertaken the same disciplinary action even absent any protected disclosure, the WPA cannot be used to shield an employee from the consequences of his own wrongful actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board likewise correctly concluded that the administrative judge should not have overturned the agency's choice of penalty for Pedeleose's misconduct. The board must give deference "to the agency's judgment unless the penalty exceeds the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Given Pedeleose's continuing pattern of sending rude and disrespectful emails to his superiors, the DCMA acted reasonably in imposing the one-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pedeleose contends that he was treated more harshly than a similarly <span id="Page_4021"></span>situated employee. In support, he relies upon the affidavit of DCMA employee Flake Farley. Farley averred that he had not been punished after telling a DCMA deputy commander that the C-5 team would not tolerate "backstabbers." As the board correctly determined, however, Farley's single statement about "backstabbers" was not comparable to the series of disrespectful comments made by Pedeleose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered Pedeleose's remaining arguments but do not find them persuasive. We therefore affirm the board's decision upholding Pedeleose's one-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board made it difficult to prove a pattern or trend of reprisal when the appellant was denied the opportunity to present a witness who would testify to treatment arguably comparable to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 112 MSPR 607, 618-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2009 MSPB 220 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the AJ improperly disallowed Steve Ehret as witness because Ehret would have testified that the agency treated Ehret similarly to the appellant after Ehret made whistleblowing disclosures. The appellant asserted below that Ehret, who was retired, would testify "about the facts in the final paragraph of these pre-hearing submissions," and that his testimony would show a pattern or practice of retaliation taken by NFESC against whistleblowers. The appellant alleged that NFESC began to "treat Mr. Ehret in ways similar to the Appellant" after Ehret made whistleblowing disclosures, such as canceling leave for a vacation, giving Ehret a critical assignment, not giving Ehret feedback on the assignment, and having Richard Messock, the deciding official in this case, tell Ehret that the agency "could remove him within 30 days if they wanted to," and that Ehret ultimately applied for and was appointed to a different agency job overseas. After the AJ did not approve Ehret as a witness, the appellant objected to the denial and asserted that, under Federal Rule of Evidence 406 and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Department of the Interior,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 631 (1990), Ehret should have been permitted to testify to show a pattern of retaliation by NFESC toward whistleblowers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An AJ has wide discretion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(8), (10) to exclude witnesses where it has not been shown that their testimony would be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious. <span class="Italic">Franco v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1985). Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to Board proceedings, the Board will look to them for guidance. <span class="Italic">Hayden v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 296, 302 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 758 F.2d 668 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table). Federal Rule of Evidence 406 provides that evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or routine practice. Adequacy of sampling and uniformity of response can be considered controlling considerations in determining whether a practice of an organization is so consistent that it becomes habitual or routine. <span class="Italic">Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Company, Inc.,</span> 513 F.3d 1261, 1285 (11th Cir. 2008). Thus, it is only when the examples offered to establish such pattern of conduct or habit are numerous enough to base an inference of systematic conduct and to establish a regular response to a repeated specific situation, or where the examples are sufficiently regular or the circumstances sufficiently similar to outweigh the danger, if any, of prejudice and confusion, that they are admissible to establish a habit or routine practice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's proffer of the testimony of a single individual who left the agency in 2000 does not rise to the level of a habit or routine on the part of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Goldsmith,</span> 513 F.3d at 1285-86 (four examples were not enough to support an inference of retaliation for discrimination complaints; in addition, each employee was terminated in response to different situations); <span class="Italic">Elion v. Jackson,</span> 544 F. Supp.2d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2008) (among the factors to consider in determining whether testimony of past discriminatory or retaliatory behavior toward other employees is relevant and sufficiently more probative than unfairly prejudicial is whether the past behavior by the employer is close in time to the events at issue). Even assuming, however, that a single witness would be enough to establish a habit or routine, <span class="Italic">cf. Umshler,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. at 631 (the AJ erred by denying both witnesses the appellant requested to establish that the agency engaged in a pattern and practice of using directed reassignments for improper purposes), the appellant did not show that he and Ehret were similarly situated, <span class="Italic">see Wagner v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 447, 453-54 (1992) (the AJ did not abuse his discretion in denying a request for five witnesses to establish a pattern of reprisal for whistleblowing because the witnesses were not similarly situated to the appellant), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 996 F.2d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). The appellant, for example, did not assert that the acting official or officials knew of Ehret's alleged disclosures and either removed Ehret or even proposed Ehret's removal within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosures were a contributing factor in a personnel action. Thus, for all of the above reasons, the appellant has not shown an abuse of discretion in the AJ's determination to deny the appellant's request to have Ehret testify at the hearing.</p>

Unlike the appellant, who departed from her job duties and responsibilities as a contract and procurement attorney by participating in the interview of the intern, the security specialist responded to a report of harassment and acted within his job duties by interviewing the intern and investigating the claim of harassment. We also agree with the administrative judge that the employees' different positions of employment within the agency justifies the different levels of discipline imposed, and we find no reason to differ with the administrative judge's conclusion that neither the proposing nor the deciding official had a strong motive to retaliate against the appellant.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While it appears that these two individuals did not engage in protected activity and were not penalized for their performance, there is no evidence that the errors they committed were as extensive as those the appellant committed, and, for that reason, we agree with the administrative judge that they were not similarly situated to her.
