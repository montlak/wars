<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-65"><span class="space">b.</span> Mental Impairment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Good cause exists for untimely filing of an appeal when the employee establishes that his untimely filing resulted from mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">Corbin v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 43 MSPR 318, 321 (1990). Evidence may be strictly scrutinized if offered to show that an appeal was untimely because of mental disability. For submitted medical evidence to be persuasive that the appellant was too disabled to handle his personal and legal affairs, the medical evidence should be specific. Should the disability be considered continuing, there ought to be an explanation of how, at some time after the onset of the disability, the appellant was able to seek out counsel or a representative and then file the appeal. <span class="Italic">Mathews v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 645, 648 (1987). Psychiatric evidence was sufficient to warrant the acceptance of a late appeal in <span class="Italic">Booker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 468, 470 (1992) (employee's psychiatric condition, documented by a medical report, constituted a circumstance beyond the employee's control that prevented her from exercising due diligence in filing her appeal during and after a period of hospitalization), and in <span class="Italic">Buendia v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 308, 312 (1990) (psychiatric evidence showing that the appellant's intense state of disorientation and trauma rendered her unable to deal effectively with the removal notice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mental impairment supports waiver of the deadline for an appeal if the impairment covers the period allowed for the appeal and if the impairment is documented and explained by competent medical personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vargo v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3410) (belated enforcement petition: the Board should have examined any evidence suggesting that the delay was caused by mental impairment; additional evidence should have been taken by the Board in considering the issue when the record was scant, but there was at least some evidence before the Board of the impairment); <span class="Italic">Bailey v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3336) (suggesting that a delay while the appellant was hospitalized for a mental disorder would be excused, but the periods between hospitalization when the appellant admitted he could think soundly should have been used to file an appeal); <span class="Italic">Braxton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 119 MSPR 157, 2013 MSPB 8 (2013) (recognizing mental impairment and remanding for determination of whether the impairment was of sufficient severity to interfere with the ability to file an appeal); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. USDA</span>, 101 MSPR 103, 106 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 20 (2006) (appeal one day late by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant was excused on the basis of various psychological problems, including adult ADD, affecting his attention and concentration); <span class="Italic">Hendrickson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 85 MSPR 334, 337 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (delay of a few days was excused for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant whose medical evidence, submitted with her PFR, demonstrated that she suffered from a delusional disorder); <span class="Italic">Choice v. VA</span>, 78 MSPR 428, 431-33 (1998) (late appeal was excused for an appellant suffering medically-documented and otherwise corroborated paranoid ideation and delusional thinking); <span class="Italic">Blaine v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 449, 451-52 (1993) (excusing an appeal, late by one day, filed by an appellant on medication that caused mental confusion); <span class="Italic">Tuten v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 30, 32 (1986) (mentally incompetent appellant irrationally and intentionally withheld an OPM reconsideration decision from her representative for five months); <span class="Italic">Glover v. GPO</span>, 11 MSPR 631, 633 (1982) (short delay excused based on evidence that employee was heavily sedated with medication when appeal was due); <span class="Italic">Vauls v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 523, 524, 5 MSPB 51 (1981) (mental incompetence justified the late filing of an appeal by an employee discharged for fatally shooting his supervisor); <span class="Italic">Luna v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 121, 123 (1980) (a delay of 12 days in filing an appeal was excused: "[T]he appellant was suffering from a mental disorder as determined by agency's designated physician."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Matott v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 637, 642-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2003) (elderly appellant's stroke and slower comprehension, medical problems of family member who assisted the appellant in preparing her appeal, death of husband, inability to retain counsel were not sufficient to excuse seven weeks of delay in the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In evaluating an appellant's mental ability, the Board may consider whether the appellant was able to file adequate pleadings <span class="Italic">pro se</span> or whether the pleadings were prepared by or with the assistance of counsel or a guardian. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Hass v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 110, 115 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) (considering whether a delay in filing a disability retirement application was justified through mental incapacity; the appellant pursued her legal affairs only through the assistance of others and through counsel and other representatives), and <span class="Italic">Pilcher v. OPM</span>, 96 MSPR 317, 323 &#x00B6; 23 (2004) (that the appellant executed court documents with the assistance of counsel would not itself establish mental competence, although it is evidence of competence), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Carmack v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 270, 272 (1982) (Board declined to excuse a belated filing for "post-Vietnam stress syndrome" when the appellant filed a timely EEO complaint, participated in EEO counseling, and initiated a timely grievance). But if there is other evidence of mental disability, the fact that the appellant pursued legal claims without assistance does not constitute compelling evidence that she had more than a minimum capacity to manage her own affairs. <span class="Italic">Rapp v. OPM</span>, 108 MSPR 674, 686-87 &#x00B6; 21, 2008 MSPB 107 (2008) (disability retirement appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The time for filing an appeal will be suspended for the period of the employee's mental incompetency if the employee diligently follows through on filing the appeal after the restoration of competency. <span class="Italic">Vauls v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 523, 524, 5 MSPB 51 (1981). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Maguire v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 49 MSPR 395, 398 (1991) (evidence of incapacity must be linked to the filing period for the appeal). In <span class="Italic">Cox v. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 4 MSPR 191, 194, 4 MSPB 272 (1980), a short waiver was granted because of appellant's emotional stress caused by his need to care for a terminally ill parent, exacerbated by his recent dismissal from the federal service, and coupled with misleading agency advice as to the appeal period. The Board gave no weight to the statement of appellant's counsel that he had been on trial in another case and was unable to attend to the filing of appellant's petition on a timely basis. In <span class="Italic">Pierce v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 521, 524 &#x00B6; 10 (1999), delay of a day or two in an appeal from an OPM overpayment determination was excused when the appellant was in contact with OPM concerning its decision, notified OPM of her interest in appealing to the <span id="Page_952"></span>Board, suffered from memory problems, and was confused about whether she should await further information from OPM concerning her overpayment or whether she should appeal to the Board. But a waiver was not granted for a delay of about 100 days because an appellant was distressed over the death of a friend and was attending to the matters of the deceased. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 35 MSPR 674, 678 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">O'Hagan v. DHS</span>, 96 MSPR 434, 437 &#x00B6; 7 (2004) ("In the absence of corroborating evidence, an appellant's allegation that he was emotionally upset is insufficient to establish good cause for a late filing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence of mental impairment should be specific. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA,</span> DE-0752-11-0417-I-1 (NP July 13, 2012) ("Below and on review, the appellant refers to the fact that, in 1994, the agency placed him on leave pending a psychiatric evaluation indicating that he could return to his position. In his petition, he states that his disability has gone untreated and unresolved for 17 years. The appellant, however, has not presented any evidence, medical or otherwise, that would show that he was incompetent to file his appeal during the past 17 years. Thus, the appellant's alleged incompetence does not provide a basis to show good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 8 (2000) (evidence of appellant's incompetency was sufficient to establish good cause for untimely filing on ground of incapacity)."); <span class="Italic">Lodree v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 253, 255 (1992) (general allegations of mental incapacity that are not corroborated by medical evidence are insufficient to establish good cause); <span class="Italic">Van Cura v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 566, 570 (1993) (psychologist's report was incorporated into an affidavit).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should inform the appellant whose appeal appears to be late of the nature of specific arguments and evidence that can be advanced to support waiver, <span class="Italic">Earl v. Dept. of Army</span>, 79 MSPR 194, 197 &#x00B6; 5-6 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With her petition for review, the appellant submits, for the first time, a statement from her treating psychologist, David Moyerman, Ph.D., dated November 10, 1997, prior to the issuance of the initial decision. Generally, the Board will not consider evidence offered for the first time on petition for review, absent a showing that such evidence was unavailable prior to the close of the record below. <span class="Italic">See Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 3 MSPB 308, 3 MSPR 211, 214 (1980). Nevertheless, we note that the administrative judge's acknowledgment order in this case did not set forth the specific showing that an appellant must make if he alleges that an untimely filing is due to illness. The agency's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed only discussed the Board's case law regarding this issue in general terms. Thus, the appellant was never placed on notice of the specific criteria she was required to meet to make a showing of good cause under such circumstances, even though she placed the administrative judge on notice that she was claiming depression as the cause of the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an appellant states that the reason for a filing delay is physical or mental illness, she cannot be expected to "fight a fog of generality." <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 75 F.3d 639, 646 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Rather, she must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis, and she must be afforded a fair opportunity to submit evidence and argument to show that she met that standard<span class="Italic">. See Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 434, 437-38 (1998). Thus, under the circumstances of this case, because the appellant was never properly advised as to the showing she was required to make to establish good cause for waiver of the Board's time limits on the basis of illness, we will consider her supplementary submission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedural requirements and evidentiary burdens governing litigation over late appeals filed by appellants with apparent mental impairments, including the agency's obligation to furnish evidence, were summarized in <span class="Italic">Burton v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 174, 177-78 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that the medical conditions of depression and anxiety prevented his timely filing. To establish that the untimely filing was the result of his illness, the appellant must: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical or other supporting evidence showing that he suffered from the illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See Lacy</span>, 78 MSPR at 437. Contrary to the administrative judge's belief, the appellant need not establish that he was "incapacitated," but is required only to explain why his alleged illness impaired his ability to meet the Board's filing limits or seek an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See Lacy</span>, 78 MSPR at 437, n.*. Further, the appellant was entitled to receive notice of these requirements, which the administrative judge did not provide. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 168 F.3d 1305, 1307 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, although a general claim that additional, unspecified documents are needed does not establish good cause for waiver of the time limit, <span class="Italic">see Holt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 240, 242 (1988), to the extent that the appellant is claiming that the agency had medical records that support his request for a waiver of the time limit, he may be entitled to have such documents considered in light of the <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> criteria. <span class="Italic">See Smith,</span> 168 F.3d at 1307. In fact, the agency is obligated to file whatever evidence it has concerning timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 MSPR 144, 149 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, although the appellant continues to argue that he needs additional documents, the record does include some documentation of his illness, such as the forms completed by Dr. Leader. We find that these forms, along with the evidence that the appellant received repeated prescriptions for trazodone, do establish that the appellant was diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and was being treated for it. It is not clear to us that this evidence is clearly outweighed by the fact that the appellant was able to pursue his claims in other venues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant lacked a meaningful opportunity to address timeliness, we must remand the appeal to permit one. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Klages v. Department of Defense,</span> 80 MSPR 594, 597 (1999). In this regard, he should be given another opportunity to request a hearing. In any event, on remand, the appellant is to be given specific notice of the <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> requirements, and to be given a reasonable opportunity to respond with information relevant to the question of timeliness. He should be instructed to file organized and clear submissions, limited to the issue at hand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency has relevant information which it has failed to provide, it must submit it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the AJ again resolved that Burton's appeal was untimely. Burton sought review with the Federal Circuit, but the court affirmed the Board's finding of untimeliness. Despite Burton's mental condition and medication, "he nonetheless was able to conduct a number of sophisticated legal or legal-related activities," including filing an EEO complaint in court, writing to his congressman, appearing in district court to argue motions, and responding to MSPB orders. <span class="Italic">Burton v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3140).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, at a minimum, requires notice to the appellant that she has the opportunity to explain a delay caused by a medical condition through identification of the period of that condition, an explanation of how the condition prevented timely filing, and submission of corroborative evidence. However, the Board does not provide a synopsis of its case law to guide impaired appellants and their physicians on how the proof should be organized or what types of explanations will pass Board muster. In <span class="Italic">Russo v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 501, 503-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2003), after the appellant received a "<span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice " [<span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 434 (1998)], the appellant obtained a medical statement that his mental condition impaired his ability to timely file the appeal. The evidence was insufficient, apparently because the physician did not spell out subsidiary factual findings supporting his medical conclusion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not specifically state that the reason for his filing delay was a physical or mental illness, pleadings from <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants should be read "liberally." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 292, 298 n.4 (1997); <span class="Italic">Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 97-98 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). In his petition for appeal, the appellant included a copy of the agency's internal grievance decision. That decision stated that, during the grievance process, the appellant's union representative argued that the appellant should not be held accountable for the actions that led to his removal. The union representative argued that the appellant's past medical history provided a defense to the appellant's actions underlying the agency's charge. Apparently, neither the appellant nor the union representative provided any medical documentation to support such an argument. The union representative did not continue to represent the appellant beyond the internal grievance process, and the appellant has acted <span class="Italic">pro se</span> since that time. Because the decision from the agency's internal grievance process mentioned the appellant's medical problems, and the appellant has stated, among other things, that disorientation was a reason for his failure to timely file his appeal, it would have been appropriate for the administrative judge to clarify whether a medical condition was the reason for his delay in filing the petition<span class="Italic">. See Lacy v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437-38 (1998). In the absence of such notice, the Clerk of the Board issued a <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice after receipt of the appellant's petition for review.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Clerk of the Board informed the appellant that in order to establish that his untimely filing was the result of a medical condition, he had to: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the condition; (2) submit medical and/or corroborating evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged condition during that time period; and (3) explain how the condition prevented him from filing his appeal or requesting an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See Lacy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 437.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's response to the <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice consists of a psychiatrist's letter stating that the appellant suffers from bipolar disorder, has been under psychiatric treatment since March 27, 1996, and is taking psychotropic medication for his condition. The letter states further that the appellant's psychiatric condition interfered with his ability to timely file an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an appellant states that the reason for a filing delay is physical or mental illness, he must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis, and he must <span id="Page_953"></span>be afforded a "fair opportunity" to submit evidence and argument to show that he met that standard. <span class="Italic">Lacy,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. at 438. The evidence submitted by an appellant "must explain" how the condition prevented him from filing or requesting an extension of time during the period of the delay. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 500 &#x00B6; 12 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 232 F.3d 913 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the letter the appellant has submitted from his psychiatrist does not explain how the appellant's illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time, as required by <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> and the notice issued by the Clerk. There is no indication that the <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice was deficient, or that the appellant was confused by the requirements set forth in the notice. Under similar circumstances, the Board has dismissed, as untimely filed, submissions that did not meet the third <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> element<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Davis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 456 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2003); <span class="Italic">Crozier v. Department of Transportation,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 438 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2003); <span class="Italic">Luther v. Department of Defense,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 172 &#x00B6; 10 (2001); <span class="Italic">Osborne v. Small Business Administration</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 357 &#x00B6; 10 (1999); <span class="Italic">cf. Le Master v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 680 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998) (good cause shown where the appellant's psychologist explained that the cognitive aspects of the appellant's major depression rendered him unable to appreciate and probably unable to remember the filing deadline); <span class="Italic">Earl</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Army,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 194 &#x00B6; 9 (1998) (finding good cause for the filing delay where the medical evidence explained that the appellant's depression, among other things, caused deficiencies in concentration, persistence, and pace that resulted in a failure to complete tasks in a timely manner).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, considering the findings by the administrative judge that the appellant did not show good cause for the delay, and taking into account the length of the delay and the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, we DISMISS the appeal as untimely filed. The appellant has not met his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the circumstances of this case<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)] ; <span class="Italic">Alonzo v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980).</p>
