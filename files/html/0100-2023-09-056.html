<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-55"><span class="space">b.</span> Current Law on Waiver; Multifactor Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the fairly forgiving nature of the policy toward untimely appeals expressed in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, for years the Board dismissed untimely appeals with little regard to the length of the delay or the reasons for the failure to meet the filing deadline. Principally at the urging of Chairman Erdreich, who was supported by the Federal Circuit, the law underwent a transformation starting in 1993, so that the Board and its reviewing court now apply <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> to allow untimely appeals from those appellants, particularly those who are <span class="Italic">pro se,</span> who exercised reasonable diligence in their attempts to timely file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1993, the Federal Circuit weighed in with a decision faulting the Board for imposing on appellants the burden of showing that it was impossible to meet a filing deadline. The court favored a rule of reason, first espoused in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> <span id="Page_934"></span>but then departed from by many Board decisions, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DOJ</span>, 999 F.2d 532, 533-35 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 15, 1992, the Department of Justice removed Anderson from his position as a correctional officer at the Federal Bureau of Prisons on the ground that he had falsified employment documents and security investigation forms. Anderson's removal was effective May 22, 1992, and the letter of removal informed him that any notice of appeal to the Board had to be filed no later than twenty calendar days after the effective date....&#8197;Accordingly, Anderson was required to file his appeal by June 11, 1992. Anderson filed his appeal on June 12, 1992, one day late, and the AJ ordered him to show good cause for the delay....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Anderson responded to the AJ's order, attributing his delay to circumstances beyond his control. Specifically, he stated that he was hospitalized from May 11, 1992 until June 4, 1992, during which time he was unable to contact or meet with a legal representative. He stated that after his release from the hospital he was unable to establish contact with his legal representative until June 8 and accordingly he was unable to meet the filing deadline. He established contact with his representative on June 8 and his appeal was filed one day late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ declined to waive the time limit. Acknowledging that a one-day delay is "minimal," the AJ nevertheless concluded that Anderson's inability to obtain a representative did not establish good cause and that he had failed to show that he exercised ordinary prudence and diligence. The AJ thus dismissed the appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board. On appeal, we will disturb the grant or denial of such a waiver only if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7703(c) (1988). We believe such an abuse is present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Anderson argues that the AJ abused her discretion in failing to take into consideration the rules restricting visitation and phone calls of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment center in which he was hospitalized. Anderson also states that the AJ failed to consider the fact that after he left the hospital he was unable to contact his legal representative during the four days prior to June 8, which included a weekend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. "Delay is excusable where, under the circumstances, a petitioner exercised diligence or ordinary prudence." <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653. In <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986), we endorsed the Board's standards guiding its consideration as to whether good cause exists as set forth in <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 813-14 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> the Board recognized the strong policy favoring a hearing on the merits, and stated that "'good cause' is an elastic concept [which] entitles the employee <span id="Page_935"></span>to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience." 4 MSPR at 183-84 (citation omitted). The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay, such excuse should be accepted by the presiding official, absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing. The appellant need not show an utter impossibility, but only that the delay was excusable in light of the particular facts and attending circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence has been exercised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4 MSPR at 184. Relevant to this determination is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the length of the delay and whether there existed circumstances beyond the control of the appellant affecting his ability to comply with the time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board concluded that Alonzo's four-day delay was excusable because the unavailability of his legal representative was a circumstance beyond his control and the agency was not prejudiced by the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in this case, Anderson responded to the AJ's order to show cause, stating that his one-day delay was due to circumstances beyond his control. Specifically, for the first seven days of his hospital stay Anderson was not allowed to send or receive mail, make or receive phone calls, or have visitors. After that initial period, visitation was limited to immediate family members, and Anderson was permitted to make phone calls only after regular business hours. These rules effectively precluded Anderson from contacting or meeting with his legal representative while he was in the hospital. Anderson stated that after he left the hospital he diligently pursued his appeal, but was unable to contact his legal representative until June 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that Anderson had one full week to file his appeal after he was released from the hospital and that he failed to act diligently and with ordinary prudence in filing his appeal on time. We do not agree, since Anderson stated that he took action toward filing his appeal immediately upon his release from the hospital but was unable to contact his representative. These circumstances collectively constitute a reasonable excuse for Anderson's delay and the government has not alleged that it was prejudiced by the minimal delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, in which the petitioner filed her appeal approximately five weeks late and "simply and completely ignored" the AJ's order to show good cause. 966 F.2d at 653. Here, Anderson responded to the AJ's order in a timely manner with a statement explaining precisely why he was unable to file his appeal on time. One who is hospitalized is entitled to give primary consideration to recovery of his health without being considered to lack diligence in showing good cause. Moreover, finding an attorney within four days of release from a hospital is not unreasonable. Further, the evidence shows the attorney diligently acted on the case in promptly preparing the appeal. The attorney stated that he took the papers to Anderson for signature the evening of June 10, 1992, and that he deposited the papers in the mail that night, although they were not postmarked until the next day. We presume the attorney is mistaken in stating that he mailed the papers on June 10 and that these events occurred on the eleventh. Nevertheless, we conclude this minor inconsistency does not outweigh the clear diligence otherwise shown by both Anderson and his attorney. A holding of lack of good cause under these circumstances is equivalent to requiring a showing that it was impossible to appeal in time, which is not the law. In view of the minimal delay, the reasonableness of the excuse, and the lack of prejudice to the government, it was an abuse of discretion for the AJ not to waive the time limit for good cause.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's refusal to excuse minimal delays, and the ambiguity of some notices explaining the calculation of time, again fell under attack in <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1581-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant filed two days late because he understood the filing period to be measured in working rather than calendar days. The appellant had other difficulties, including stress from a family-related problem. The removal notice did not advise the employee how "days" would be calculated, but the Board regulations that were attached to the removal notice did explain the calculus. Unimpressed, the court concluded that notice should be made more clear--more than a jumble of regulations attached to a removal notice (the court was suggesting that the removal notice itself explain with certainty the deadline for filing an appeal). The Board's rigid, formalistic approach toward timeliness problems was incorrect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rendering the Board's initial decision on 22 October 1992, the AJ rejected petitioner's arguments, dismissed his appeal as untimely, and concluded not only that Walls's misunderstanding did "not constitute good cause for waiver of the Board's timeliness regulation" but also that Walls had "failed to demonstrate that he utilized either ordinary prudence or due diligence in appealing his removal." The Board's initial decision became final on 3 February 1993 when the full Board denied Walls's petition for review for failure to meet review criteria set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115 (1993). This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The system for appellate review of civil service agencies' decisions was enacted under Title II of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978....&#8197;Pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), (k) (1988 &#x0026; Supp. IV 1992), the Board promulgates regulations to carry out the purposes of the appeals process as intended by Congress under this Act. In its decision letter informing an employee of his impending removal, the agency must provide the employee with "[n]otice of the time limits for appealing to the Board [and a]...copy, or access to a copy, of the Board's regulations." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21(a), (c) (1993).

<p class="Block-Quote1">"[W]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal [of an agency action] should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992). We review decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board under a narrow standard prescribed by statute. We must affirm the Board's decision to deny a good cause waiver of the subsection 1201.22(b) filing deadline in this case unless the decision is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1988);<span class="Italic"> see Beardmore v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has acknowledged that its "regulations include no specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown for waiving the <span id="Page_936"></span>time limitation on the filing of an appeal." <span class="Italic">Alonzo v.

"If the employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay, such excuse should be accepted by the presiding official, absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Finally, the Board has identified the following factors, not necessarily all-inclusive, that should be considered by the AJ in determining whether a good cause waiver of the filing deadline should be granted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the length of the delay; whether appellant was notified of the time limit or was otherwise aware of it; the existence of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant which affected his ability to comply with the time limits; the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent; circumstances which show that any neglect involved is excusable neglect; a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune; and the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency which would result from waiver of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnotes omitted). "Excusable neglect" is neglect that a reasonably prudent person might manifest under the circumstances<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> n.1. "Unavoidable casualty or misfortune" is not preventable by "the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence or human prudence or foresight." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> n.2. "Prejudice to the agency" relates to the agency's inability to adequately and effectively defend its action because of appellant's untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We previously have recognized the efficacy of the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factors in good cause determinations by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (holding that good cause waiver was appropriate because petitioner demonstrated due diligence in filing within twenty days of a dispositive Board decision in a related case); <span class="Italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 813-14 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (holding that good cause waiver was appropriate because the agency's "threat of retaliation by criminal prosecution for the exercise of petitioner's legal right to appeal was a reasonable excuse for not meeting the regulatory time limit."). Therefore, we will utilize these factors in analyzing the AJ's denial of the good cause waiver in the case before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rendering the Board's initial decision, the AJ truncated his analysis of the "length of delay" factor by asserting that "regardless of how minimal the delay, [the Board] will not waive its timeliness regulations in the absence of a showing that there is good cause for the appeal being filed untimely." No further discussion of the minimal nature--only two days--of Walls's filing delay is found. Both <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> and our precedent instruct that the AJ should consider "length of delay" in every good cause determination, not that the AJ should summarily dismiss the minimal nature of the delay in his preliminary inquiry leading to that determination. In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993), we concluded that "[r]elevant to th[e good cause] determination is...the length of delay." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 534. Furthermore, we held that, "[i]n view of the minimal [one-day] delay," among other considerations, a good cause waiver of the subsection 1201.22(b) filing deadline was warranted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 535. Similarly, in this case, we find that the minimal nature of Walls's filing delay is a consideration in his favor; it indicates not only an absence of negligence on part of petitioner but also that he demonstrated due diligence and ordinary prudence in filing the appeal within the regulatory time period as construed by him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the AJ's finding that the Agency provided adequate notice to petitioner of the time limits for appealing to the Board, petitioner asserts that the "within twenty (20) days" notice provided in the Agency's decision letter was not effective notice--notwithstanding inclusion of a sample filing period calculation within the Board regulations attached to the letter--because "days," absent further qualification, is subject to reasonable misinterpretation and because petitioner, proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, was not directed to the sample calculation amidst twenty-six pages of rules and regulations "[a]ttached for [petitioner's] reference." We agree. In filing his appeal of an agency removal action, we do "not expect a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant to be made to jump through a confusing array of procedural hoops." <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653. Furthermore, we note that the Board itself, ostensibly in an effort to provide unambiguous notice of the applicable filing period for appeals of its initial decisions as set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(d) (1993), requires that the "date upon which the decision will become final" be contained in the initial decision rather than a mere reference to the thirty-five day filing period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(5). Also, final decisions of the Board notify appellants that they have "30 calendar days" to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A number of civil service agencies have followed the Board's lead in providing unambiguous notice, in decision letters to petitioners, of "twenty calendar days" as the time period for appealing agency actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532, 533 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Federal Bureau of Prisons); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (U.S. Army Reserve); <span class="Italic">Huey v. DHHS</span>, 782 F.2d 1575, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Social Security Administration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ relied on Board decisions in <span class="Italic">Kolb v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 100 (1990), and in <span class="Italic">Kortz v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 496 (1990), in finding that petitioner's misinterpretation of the "twenty (20) days" notice included in the Agency's decision letter was "insufficient to constitute excusable neglect." The Board also cites <span class="Italic">Kolb</span> in its brief. By the Board's own admission, <span class="Italic">Kolb</span> "shall have no precedential effect, except for cases involving identical issues and indistinguishable facts." <span class="Italic">Kolb</span>, 43 MSPR at 104 n.2<span class="Italic">. Kolb</span> clearly is distinguishable from the case before us. In <span class="Italic">Kolb</span> petitioner was provided the actual deadline date for filing his petition for review whereas Walls was provided a time period within which to file his appeal. While a date is inherently unambiguous, a time period specified in "days" may not be. <span class="Italic">Kortz is</span> distinguishable because petitioner in that case also was provided a deadline date for filing; he initially filed a deficient petition for review, was two days late in refiling his revised petition, and did not timely respond to the Board's notice affording petitioner the opportunity to show good cause for his late filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), we held that the agency's failure to provide notice to petitioner of her appeal rights, without more, constituted good cause for her untimely filing<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 674. <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> involved a "flagrant violation of the regulations by the [agency] in failing to give petitioner notice of her appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 673. The notice shortcomings in the case before us are somewhat less egregious; however, in light of the foregoing discussion, we conclude that the "within twenty (20) days" notice provided to Walls in the Agency's decision letter is sufficiently ambiguous under the circumstances to not properly discharge the Agency's notice obligation to petitioner as set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21(a) (1993). <span class="Italic">See Waldau v. MSPB</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1403 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("[T]he government must unambiguously and clearly give notice of that which it requires of a litigant." (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). We further conclude that the inadequate notice, Walls's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status and his averments of emotional stress and strain, and the minimal delay collectively constitute good cause for the untimely filing of petitioner's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon petitioner's showing of good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal, waiver of the filing deadline is appropriate, <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 184; 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, .22(c) (1993), "absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing," <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 184; <span class="Italic">see Ceja</span>, 710 F.2d at 814. Because petitioner has shown good cause for his untimely filing and because the Agency has made no showing of substantial prejudice flowing from the two-day filing delay, we hold that the AJ abused his discretion by not waiving the filing deadline for good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the Board's dismissal of petitioner's appeal and remand for a proceeding on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walls</span> is not a pronouncement by the Federal Circuit that all short filing delays will be excused. If the appellant is careless rather than confused, his appellant may not find forgiveness, <span class="Italic">Davis v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3395):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Davis argues on appeal that his confusion is a valid excuse under our decision in <span class="Italic">Walls</span>. We disagree. In <span class="Italic">Walls</span> the appellant argued that he received ambiguous notice because the notice did not make clear that 20 days meant calendar days, rather than working days. Davis, however, clearly understood that he had 30 calendar days to file his appeal as he demonstrated in his response to the Board's Acknowledgement Order wherein he argued that Saturday, September 3, 1994 was 30 days from August 3, 1994. Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Walls</span> who incorrectly interpreted a notice that he argued was ambiguous, Davis made a careless mistake in counting the number of days in the month of August. Moreover, the record indicates that the union representative explained the notice to Davis. Thus, the type of "confusion" present in <span class="Italic">Walls</span> where the appellant reasonably misunderstood the notice is absent here, and we cannot conclude that Davis' carelessness can constitute a "reasonable" excuse.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 695 F.2d at 1391 (carelessness not an adequate reason to explain why appellant's appeal was untimely filed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Chairman Erdreich dissented because he considered the notice, delivered to Davis for the first time at the pre-arbitration meeting on August 3, 1994 and stating that Davis was removed effective November 8, 1993, and that Davis had 20 days to appeal, confusing in the same way the notice in <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, which did not specify whether calendar or working days were to be used in calculating the filing deadline, was confusing. We decline to apply <span class="Italic">Walls</span> in this case where it is clear that Davis was in fact not confused and where the notice was explained to Davis. Here the issue is straightforward--whether a careless error without more is the type of excuse for untimely filing that constitutes "good cause."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we consider the absence of evidence of actual prejudice to the <span id="Page_937"></span>agency reason enough to reverse the Board's decision. Although under <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> prejudice to the agency is a relevant factor and the AJ did not discuss it, we cannot conclude that in all cases where the agency cannot show actual prejudice that the appellant has shown "good cause." To so rule would make a mockery of the rules and regulations for filing appeals. Similarly, we will not reverse the Board in this case for the AJ's minimal analysis of the delay per our holding in <span class="Italic">Walls</span> that the minimal nature of delay is a factor in the appellant's favor. We conclude that the AJ did consider the minimal nature of the four day delay here but found it inexcusable in light of Davis' carelessness, and the fact that he actually received ten additional days to file due to the belated notice delivered by the agency and the interim change in regulations allowing 30 days rather than 20 days for appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 31109 (June 17, 1994) (codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (1995)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reflects division on occasion concerning Board decisions refusing to waive brief delays in appeals filed by representatives or parties who offer no substantial excuse for the delay. Consider the majority and dissenting opinions in <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. MSPB</span>, 253 Fed. Appx. 930, 931-33 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), questioning dismissal of an appeal, half a day late, filed by a nonprofit legal advocacy organization that apparently offered no substantial reason for the delay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Larry M. Skaggs was separated after twenty-two years of service in the Department of the Navy because he was found to be physically unable to perform the duties of his position. Through counsel, an attorney with the Advocacy Center for Persons With Disabilities, a non-profit advocacy organization that is funded through federal grants and does not charge its clients for services, Mr. Skaggs filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") twelve hours past the 30-day deadline. The administrative judge ("AJ") assigned to the case dismissed the appeal as untimely, finding that the attorney was negligent and therefore Mr. Skaggs failed to show good cause for the delay in filing.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). In due course the decision of the AJ became the final decision of the Board. Mr. Skaggs timely appeals the Board's decision to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case--the petitioner relied on <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel from a Government-sponsored advocacy organization located 300 miles from his residence; the attorney missed the filing deadline by less than a day; the attorney stated that he worked diligently on the appeal in the days immediately preceding the filing day; and the agency only briefly noted the timeliness issue and proceeded to address the merits of the case--we are not comfortable summarily affirming the AJ's decision not to waive the filing deadline, particularly in view of the cursory manner in which the AJ addressed the issue. We are aware that whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived is a matter within the broad discretion of the Board. <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Nevertheless, the Board early on stated that, though there is a need for finality in personnel actions, "[t]here are strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and that they be ensured a fair opportunity to secure from the Board an independent review of agency action." <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.B. 262, 263 (1980). Further, the Board said that "[g]enerally,...in cases such as these, any doubt about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 266.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision in this case, the AJ seems to have given little consideration to the range of factors relevant to whether good cause for delay has been shown, and seemed to focus primarily on the question of whether Mr. Skaggs' attorney may have been negligent in failing to file on time. This is too narrow an approach. <span class="Italic">See Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994).[1] We believe that Mr. Skaggs is entitled to a more thorough evaluation of whether a waiver of the time limit is appropriate in his case, and in the interest of justice we vacate the Board's dismissal of the case and remand for further consideration of whether good cause exists for the short filing delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Alonzo,</span> the Board identified seven specific factors to be included in the consideration: (1) the length of the delay; (2) whether the employee knew of the time limit; (3) circumstances beyond the employee's control; (4) the presence or absence of negligence; (5) whether neglect was excusable neglect; (6) unavoidable casualty or misfortune; and (7) prejudice to the agency. 4 M.S.P.B. at 264. Though some of our cases subsequently seemed to focus on only one or another factor, especially whether negligence by the employee's attorney was at the root of the problem, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Rowe v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 802 F.2d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1986), in the 1994 <span class="Italic">Walls</span> case we expressly approved the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factor analysis, in which no one factor is determinative. That remains the law of this Circuit. The length of the delay is as important as any other factor, and should be given proper weight on remand along with the other factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BRYSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I would affirm the decision of the Board. Mr. Skaggs had a full opportunity to explain the reason for his late filing, and he chose to do so through his attorney's affidavit. His attorney stated that he completed Mr. Skaggs' appeal on the afternoon of June 15, 2006, but did not file it electronically until after noon on the following day, which was one day late. The attorney failed to provide any explanation for not electronically filing the appeal on the afternoon of June 15. The clear implication of the absence of any explanation for that conduct was that the late filing was the product of negligence or oversight. Under those circumstances, it was not inappropriate for the administrative judge to note that the attorney provided no valid explanation for the delay and to point out that attorney negligence or oversight does not constitute a sufficient basis for waiving timeliness requirements under the Board's regulations and decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, the Board is entitled to prescribe procedural rules governing Board appeals. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). The Board has prescribed rules for timely filing of appeals and for waiving those requirements in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) of its regulations (appeal must be filed within 30 days and "will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown") and in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12 (administrative judge "may, for good cause shown, waive a Board regulation"). The Board has interpreted the "good reason" or "good cause" exception to the 30-day filing requirement through case law. In its decisions, the Board has consistently held that, absent a specific reason not to attribute an attorney's conduct in handling an appeal to the appellant, attorney negligence that results in an untimely filing does not constitute good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lands v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 593, 596 (2004); <span class="Italic">DePierro v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 251, 253 (1992); <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 515, 518 (1989); <span class="Italic">McAdory v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 112, 114 (1981). That is true regardless of the length of the delay. <span class="Italic">See McBurnett v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 395, 397 (1988) ("Negligence on the part of an appellant or his attorney does not constitute good cause for extending a filing deadline, even when the delay is only one (1) day."); <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 240, 241 (1984) (same). This court has upheld the Board's determination that attorney negligence does not constitute "good cause" warranting a waiver of the timeliness requirement. <span class="Italic">Rowe v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 802 F.2d 434, 437-38 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite being given the opportunity to do so, Mr. Skaggs has not pointed to any valid excuse for the filing delay in this case, and the record does not support any explanation other than negligence or oversight by an attorney who was working on Mr. Skaggs' behalf. This court's decision in <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994), on which the majority relies, does not support remand here. In Walls, this court criticized the Board for not considering the length of the delay in determining whether there was good cause for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's untimely filing of his appeal. The court explained that the short period of the delay tended to show "not only the absence of negligence on part of petitioner but also that he demonstrated due diligence and ordinary prudence in filing the appeal within the regulatory time period as construed by him." The court found that Mr. Walls had reasonably misinterpreted the agency's notice of the time for filing to refer to "working days" rather than "calendar days"; his short delay in filing was consistent with and supported that explanation. In this case, by contrast, the administrative judge considered the shortness of the delay, but found that it did not strengthen Mr. Skaggs' explanation for the delay because his attorney, unlike Mr. Walls, offered no explanation for the delay that was consistent with ordinary prudence. The shortness of the delay therefore does not serve, as it did in <span class="Italic">Walls,</span> to require that we vacate the Board's finding of a lack of good cause.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered Skaggs' case on remand, but the AJ and the Board both declined to excuse the delay. The appeal returned to court, and this time the court affirmed the Board's timeliness dismissal, <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. MSPB</span>, 364 Fed. Appx. 623, 624-27 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Skaggs was a civilian employee of the Navy for twenty-two years. On May 11, 2006, the Navy notified Skaggs that he would be removed from service effective May 16, 2006, based on his alleged medical inability to perform the essential duties of his position. The notice informed Skaggs that he had thirty calendar days from the effective date of the action in which to appeal his removal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Skaggs filed an appeal with the Board on June 16, 2006, thirty-one days after the effective date of his removal. The agency responded to this appeal on July 12, 2006, pointing out that the last date for a timely filing would have been June 15, 2006. On July 13, 2006, the administrative judge ("AJ") issued an order to show cause requiring Skaggs to show by preponderant evidence that good cause existed for his delay in filing the appeal. Skaggs's attorney at the time was Mizell Campbell, Jr. ("Campbell"), an attorney employed by the Advocacy Center For Persons With Disabilities, a not-for-profit organization that provides free assistance to individuals with disabilities. In his response to the order to show cause, Skaggs argued that his appeal was only one day late and that it was difficult for his attorney to obtain the necessary documents for the appeal because the attorney's office was 300 miles from Skaggs's residence. In addition, Campbell claimed that after meeting with Skaggs on June 12, 2006, he worked diligently on preparing the appeal until it <span id="Page_938"></span>was filed. Skaggs asserted that any negligence was excusable and that the agency made no claim that it would suffer any harm because of the one-day delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ issued an initial decision dismissing Skaggs's appeal as untimely. <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, No. AT0752060796-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 15, 2006). The Board denied Skaggs's petition for review. <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 266 (Table) (2006). On appeal, this court remanded the case to the Board for further consideration of whether good cause existed for the filing delay, finding that the AJ did not properly consider all the factors required under the standard set out in <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180 (1980). <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 253 Fed. Appx. 930 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Specifically, this court stated that "the AJ seems to have given little consideration to the range of factors relevant to whether good cause for delay has been shown, and seemed to focus primarily on the question of whether Mr. Skaggs'[s] attorney may have been negligent in failing to file on time." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 932.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ allowed the parties to supplement the record and Campbell submitted an affidavit stating that he had "mistakenly calculated the deadline for filing" because he "forgot that the month of May has 31 days rather than 30." On May 13, 2008, the AJ issued an initial decision again dismissing Skaggs's appeal. In his decision, the AJ considered each of the first six factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, finding: (1) the length of delay was brief and thus weighed in Skaggs's favor, however, it was the only factor that did so; (2) Skaggs and Campbell both knew of the time limit since it was clearly set forth in the agency's decision notice that Skaggs included with his initial appeal; (3) Skaggs was responsible for the acts of his chosen representative, and therefore Campbell's miscalculation of the deadline for appeal was not out of Skaggs's control; (4) Campbell's miscalculation was negligent; (5) Campbell's negligence was inexcusable; and (6) Skaggs did not identify any casualty or misfortune contributing to the filing delay. The AJ did not consider the seventh <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factor because he concluded that "the issue of prejudice to the agency need not be reached where, as here, no showing of good cause for the delay in filing has been shown." The Board denied Skaggs's petition for review. <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 152 (Table) (2008). Skaggs filed a timely appeal with this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's review of a decision of the Board is limited by statute. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), this court is bound by a decision of the Board unless we find it arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Carr v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 185 F.3d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)], the petitioner has the burden of proof as to the timeliness of an appeal. "Whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board." <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Skaggs requests that we reverse the Board's decision on remand because the AJ improperly applied <span class="Italic">Alonzo.</span> Skaggs asserts that the AJ analyzed only four of the seven <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factors, improperly omitting the following three factors: the presence or absence of negligence; unavoidable casualty or misfortune; and prejudice to the agency. Skaggs appears to base this argument on the fact that the AJ stated that "three factors can be evaluated together." However, this argument is without merit. The AJ clearly found that Campbell's miscalculation was negligent. ("Mr. Campbell averred that he could have filed the appeal on June 15, 2006 but for his apparent inability to read a calendar. This negligence on Mr. Campbell's part does not constitute a circumstance beyond his or Mr. Skaggs' control."). In addition, the AJ noted that Skaggs "did not identify any casualty or misfortune which prevented him from filing a timely appeal." Skaggs does not argue that he provided any such evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the seventh factor, prejudice to the agency, this court has recognized that "the agency is required to submit evidence that the untimely appeal would prejudice it only if the petitioner initially shows that there was good cause for the delay in filing the appeal." <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 811 F.2d 1498, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Womack v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 798 F.2d 453, 456 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Hence, the AJ correctly concluded that since Skaggs failed to provide a reasonable excuse for his delay in filing the initial appeal, it was unnecessary to address the question of any potential prejudice to the agency caused by the delayed filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Skaggs also argues that the AJ erred by not considering several additional factors beyond those specifically listed in <span class="Italic">Alonzo.</span> Skaggs contends these other factors weigh in his favor and include: the brevity of the delay; the exercise of due diligence and ordinary prudence in filing the appeal; the distance of counsel from Skaggs's residence; Campbell's lack of legal staff and an automatic calendaring system; and the fact that the Navy responded to the initial appeal on the merits. However, all of these additional considerations are addressed by at least one of the previously discussed <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factors. The brevity of the delay was clearly considered in the factor relating to length of delay, which the AJ found did weigh in Skaggs's favor. The exercise of due diligence, the distance separating counsel and Skaggs's residence, and Campbell's lack of legal staff and an automatic calendaring system all factor into whether Campbell's miscalculation was negligent or excusable. The AJ specifically found that Campbell was negligent and this negligence was not excusable. Finally, the fact that the Navy responded to Skaggs's appeal on the merits goes to whether the agency was prejudiced by the filing delay. As discussed above, the AJ properly determined that it was unnecessary to consider this factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Skaggs argues that, to the extent there exists any doubt about the existence of good cause for the filing delay, such doubt must be resolved in Skaggs's favor. However, the AJ found that five of six factors weighed against Skaggs and expressed no doubt about Skaggs's failure to meet his burden to show good cause. This argument is thus inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Board could reasonably conclude that the minimal length of delay in the filing of his appeal was outweighed by Skaggs's negligence. We therefore cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in concluding that Skaggs failed to show good cause for the delay in filing his appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Ladomirak v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 129 F.3d 134 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table) (affirming a Board decision that found a one-day delay in filing was untimely where the delay was the result of a miscalculation on the part of the secretary of the appellant's attorney). Accordingly, the Board's decision must be <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Walls, supra</span>, the Board began to examine more closely the length of delay in the appeal as a factor in the waiver analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 28, 32 (1994) (two-day delay was excused when the appellant's efforts were reasonably prudent). Yet <span class="Italic">Simon v. VA</span>, 65 MSPR 176, 180-81 (1994), declined to excuse a one-day delay in the refiling of an appeal because the deadline was unequivocally stated. The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, because there the appellant could "reasonably have misunderstood" the agency's notice and believed he had 20 working days rather than 20 calendar days to appeal. <span class="Italic">Dow v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 21, 24-25 (1994), however, excused a fax filing delay of one day by a law office that rectified the error as soon as it was discovered. One factor in the analysis was whether the appeal reached the Board any later than if it were timely mailed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that "[r]elevant to th[e good cause] determination is...the length of the delay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 534. Furthermore, the court held that, "[i]n view of the minimal [one-day] delay," among other considerations, a good cause waiver of the filing deadline was warranted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 535. Similarly, in this case, we find that the minimal nature of the appellant's filing delay is a consideration in her favor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we note that the appellant's attorney filed an affidavit below explaining that his legal assistant erroneously calculated the filing deadline to be October 13 instead of October 12; that the petition for appeal was actually completed on October 12, leaving what was thought to be a one-day cushion; that the legal assistant was to mail the petition for appeal when she left the office on October 12; but that she called the attorney the next morning and advised him that "due to her child being ill she hadn't mailed" the petition. The attorney stated that his office then faxed a copy of the petition to the regional office and mailed it as well. We therefore conclude that these circumstances establish a reasonable <span id="Page_939"></span>excuse for the one-day delay in filing especially since, as the appellant argued below, the appeal was actually received by the Board as quickly as would have been the case if it had been mailed before the deadline<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1583-84 (Fed. Cir. 1994). That the appellant in this case was represented, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, does not require a different result because the Board has previously excused the delay occasioned by a representatives mistaken filing. <span class="Italic">See Sanford v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 61 MSPR 207, 210 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon the appellant's showing of good cause for the untimely filing of her appeal, waiver of the filing deadline is appropriate, "absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing." 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.22(c); <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 184. Because the appellant has shown good cause for her untimely filing and because the agency did not respond to the timeliness issue and did not show substantial prejudice due to the one-day filing delay, we find that waiver of the filing deadline is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaGuardia v. OPM</span>, 102 MSPR 248, 251-52 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 146 (2006) ("The one-day delay in this case was minimal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 251, &#x00B6; 14 (2001). Furthermore, the record indicates that this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant may have been confused and misinformed regarding the procedures for requesting an extension to file an appeal. Notwithstanding his confusion, the appellant made diligent attempts to preserve his appeal rights by seeking clarification and promptly filing his appeal once he learned that he had been misinformed by the OPM official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 251, &#x00B6; 14;<span class="Italic"> <span id="Page_940"></span>Lourie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). Under these particular circumstances, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for his one-day delay in filing his petition for appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Moreover, the agency has not shown, or even alleged, that it was prejudiced by the short filing delay. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>"); <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, 69 MSPR 577, 580 (1996) (excusing an appeal filed late by a few days from a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant suffering from emotional strain: "[F]axing a copy of the petition for appeal to the regional office so that it reaches the Board as quickly as if it had been mailed before the deadline is a factor favoring a finding of good cause.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Starting in 1995, the Board began to analyze filing delays through a multifactor analysis--what <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> seemingly urged all along--including consideration of the short length of the delay in filing an appeal. <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 580, 581-82 (1995), involved an appeal that was belated but accepted, even though any one of the factors advanced by the appellant to excuse his delay in filing was insufficient to justify the belated appeal under preexisting Board law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an October 29, 1993 reconsideration decision, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denied the appellant's application for dual retirement benefits based on military and Federal service. The reconsideration decision advised the appellant that he had 25 days from the date of the decision to file an appeal with the Board, in this case, November 23, 1993. The appellant filed an appeal with the regional office on November 26, 1993, three days late (postmark date).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order that advised the appellant that his appeal appeared to be untimely filed and provided him with the opportunity to establish good cause for the late filing. In response to the administrative judge's order, the appellant asserted that: He was unable to obtain an attorney; OPM's reconsideration decision was too complicated for him to understand; he attempted to get assistance from his former employing agency and his congressman; and he was waiting to receive his military records, which he needed to prove his claim. OPM moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely, finding that the appellant failed to establish good cause for the late filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). Although the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> that its regulations included no specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown, it found that one of the factors that should be considered is the length of the delay in filing<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Board also held in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> that "any doubt about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 186. In <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court reasserted the principles established by <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, finding that the minimal delay in filing (two days) should be considered in the appellant's favor. In the present appeal, the delay was minimal; the appeal was filed three days late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another factor considered in the appellant's favor in <span class="Italic">Walls</span> was his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1583. The appellant herein is appearing <span class="Italic">pro se</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has shown that he acted diligently. As he explained in his response to the acknowledgment order issued by the administrative judge, and again in his petition for review, during the filing period he sought assistance in filing an appeal from the Director of Human Resources at his former employing agency. During this time, he also visited McDill Air Force Base in an attempt to obtain his military records, and he contacted his congressman for advice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the appellant's active pursuit of information he needed to support his claim for benefits during the filing period, together with his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status and his minimal delay in filing, we find good cause for the untimely filing of the appeal. OPM has made no showing of substantial prejudice. Accordingly, we waive the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 28, 30 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. VA</span>, 69 MSPR 86, 88 (1995) (applying <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> a combination of factors was considered, including the receipt of an amended removal decision letter: "[T]he length of a filing delay must be considered in every good cause determination and...a minimal delay--[here one] day[&#8197;] --is a consideration in the party's favor."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sammons v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 498, 499 (1984) (appeal that was untimely filed became timely when the agency subsequently amended its RIF notice to state a later effective date).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lipscomb v. DOD</span>, 69 MSPR 484, 486-88 (1996), also focused on the minimal length of the filing delay and the efforts of the appellant to meet the filing deadline. Over the dissent of Member Amador, the Board's majority excused the brief delay and remanded the appeal for adjudication:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our controlling precedent for determining whether sufficient cause has been shown for waiver of a time limit is <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180 (1980). This precedent speaks of equitable principles to be applied, not of any automatic formula which would determine waiver. The Board made clear in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There are strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and that they be ensured a fair opportunity to secure from the Board an independent review of agency action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 4 MSPR at 183.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> also emphasized that good cause for waiver of a time limit is an "elastic concept" that "entitles the employee to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 183-84, and "any doubt about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 186.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, the Board applied "broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience," enunciated in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, to the question of whether an appellant has established good cause for an untimely filing. For example, in the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> case itself, the Board accepted the appellant's excuse that the four-day delay in filing his petition for appeal was due to the unavailability of his representative, apparently caused by misinformation received from an agency supervisor. Over time, however, the Board has at times focused more on the interests of "judicial efficiency" than on the public policy favoring a hearing on the merits of a claim emphasized in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our governing court has recently registered its disapproval of such an unduly rigid approach to the problems of untimeliness by reversing Board dismissals for untimeliness in three cases: <span class="Italic">Pyles v. MSPB</span>, 45 F.3d 411 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994); and <span class="Italic">Loui v. MSPB</span>, 25 F.3d 1011 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before applying <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> and our governing court's rulings to the instant case, it would be useful to underscore the limited scope of review of our decisions by the Federal Circuit, especially since the Member in his separate opinion points to "a decade's worth of Federal Circuit decisions [which] have routinely affirmed the Board's exercise of discretion on timeliness issues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, it must be noted that, in each of the cases cited above, the Federal Circuit held that the Board's decision to dismiss the appeal as untimely was not in accordance with law because it was an abuse of discretion. Given the relative frequency with which the court finds it must address and not summarily dismiss this issue, it is obvious that this is not a well settled area of law in which the court "routinely affirms" the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the court's standard of review of Board decisions--"abuse of discretion"--is a very high standard, which by definition provides great deference to the judgment of the Board. Because this standard is so deferential, it cannot be said that the court's affirmance of any given untimeliness dismissal by the Board necessarily shows that the court approves of the Board's handling of the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to be objective, one must look to both ends of the concept of "discretion." When considering whether to waive the time limits for a late filed appeal, the Board may exercise its discretion 1) to grant the waiver, or 2) to deny the waiver. The Federal Circuit has reviewed many cases on appeal of the Board's decision to <span class="Italic">deny</span> a waiver, and it is here, in the last year, where the court has made clear its disapproval of the Board's decisions....&#8197;Its remands to the Board, highlighted by these three decisions of the court, evince strong disagreement with the Board's resolution of some timeliness issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, as well as the Federal Circuit's decisions in the three cases cited above and in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (court reversed the Board for failure to find good cause for a one-day late filing), we find good cause to waive the time limits for filing the one-day late appeal now before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute. The appellant placed her appeal in the mail just after midnight on the last day of the time limit. She had spent much of the later part of the appeal period attempting to obtain the most recent version of the Board's appeal form, all the documentation relevant to the agency's action, and the relevant agency regulations that controlled the action. On the last day of the appeal period, she and her representative worked into the night completing and copying the appeal, which was postmarked on the day following the deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Member would find that the appellant was not diligent in filing her appeal, and that it would be unfair to waive the time limits for this one-day late filing. We disagree. Simply because the appellant was not successful in her attempt to get her petition into the mail before midnight does not automatically mean that she was not diligent. To automatically deny waivers of the regulatory time limit for filing without consideration of all appropriate factors means that not all appellants are playing under the same rules. As the Member has stated in his separate opinion, "[w]e need not be skittish about exercising our authority and considering <span class="Italic">all</span> the factors in determining whether waiver is appropriate."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Walls</span> has directed that we consider the factor of the minimal nature of the delay when deciding whether to waive a filing time limit. This appeal was mailed a matter of hours beyond the end of the filing period. When this minimal delay is considered in combination <span id="Page_941"></span>with the obvious effort that the appellant expended in filing on time, we are compelled to conclude that she has demonstrated diligence and good cause for waiver of the time limit, especially as we follow the earlier admonition in <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> that, "any doubt about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of the appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 4 MSPR at 186.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To summarize, the traditional test involving acceptance of an untimely appeal is twofold: there should be no prejudice to the agency, but that is not in itself sufficient; good cause or reasonable good cause for the delay must also be demonstrated. <span class="Italic">Booker v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 219, 221, 5 MSPB 267 (1981) ("[T]he lack of substantial prejudice to the agency is the second step of the determination for finding good cause for waiving the time limit. Appellant must first show a reasonable excuse for the delay."). The test has also been stated in reverse order: only if an employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay will prejudice to the agency become significant. <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. MSPB</span>, 811 F.2d 1498, 1502 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (relying on <span class="Italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 814 (Fed. Cir. 1983)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Skaggs v. MSPB</span>, 364 Fed. Appx. 623 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (if the appellant does not provide a reasonable excuse for filing the initial appeal, it is not necessary to address the question of potential prejudice to the agency caused by delayed filing). The same test essentially applies if the appellant's appeal was dismissed with leave to refile; the refiling must occur promptly (or within a stated time) after a certain operative event, otherwise the attempted refiling is treated as an untimely appeal, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Moir v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 754 F.2d 341 (Fed. Cir. 1985), although since 1995 the Board majority followed a more relaxed analytical approach. The Board is looking to a combination of circumstances or sanctions analysis even if, under earlier case law, waiver would not have been applied to any single factor advanced by the appellant as an excuse for the filing delay.
