<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-415"><span class="space">5.</span> Reasonable Rate; Time Reasonably Invested; Location of Counsel; Travel Time and Expenses</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 65 FLRA 54, 57 n.5 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator's determination of hourly rate is a legal conclusion reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement</span>, 64 FLRA 1003 (2010) (arbitrator's determination of hourly rate reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">A counsel fee petition should provide evidence supporting the reasonableness of an hourly rate. FLRA mentioned the various means of proof of the hourly rate in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1053-54 (1993), a decision noting that fees are recoverable for litigation over fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n determining the market rate, the Authority has held that where an applicant for a fee award has a prior billing history, the reasonable hourly rate will be counsel's established billing rate....&#8197;"'[T]he rates charged in private representations may afford relevant comparisons in determining the market rate.'" <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1008 (quoting <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Blum</span>)). To obtain an award at counsel's customary billing rate, the applicant must furnish precise information concerning billing rates during the relevant time periods. Contemporaneous retainer agreements are one source of this information. Other evidence that the applicant may submit includes awards from courts and fees agreed to through settlements. <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1111-12. An applicant also may submit affidavits to show that the rate requested is in line with those in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonable comparable, skill, experience, and reputation. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1009 (quoting <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 895-96 n.11).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator reviewed the information provided in the fee application and found that Becker represented the Union in connection with the appeal of the award in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> [46 FLRA 1126 (1993)]. In determining whether the hourly rate requested by Becker was reasonable, the Arbitrator considered the hourly rate requested by Becker and the documentation provided in support of that request. The documentation examined by the Arbitrator included fee and settlement agreements involving Becker, affidavits from Becker and other attorneys performing similar work, and an attorney fee award from the MSPB. After reviewing this documentation, and comparing Becker's hourly rate request with that of other attorneys in the Washington area, the Arbitrator found that Becker's rates for 1992 and for 1993 were "consistent with rates in the Washington [area]" for attorneys with his level of expertise. The Arbitrator also examined the documentation provided by the Union setting forth the dates, time spent, and the nature of the work provided by Becker, including work related to the fee application, and found that the work all directly related to <span class="Italic">SSA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the Arbitrator made specific findings to show how the hourly rate was determined and how the hours claimed were applied to arrive at the attorney fee award. Although the Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator's findings, the Agency has failed to provide any information that demonstrates that Becker is not a private attorney or that his hourly rates are not consistent with those in the community for similar services of lawyers of comparable skill. Also, even if Becker were a Union attorney as the Agency asserts, the computation of the hourly rate would not be any different from that of a private attorney. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1007 (we stated that "where attorney fees are awarded under the Back Pay Act to successful employees represented by union attorneys, we will use market-rate fees to calculate the payment of those attorney fees").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Finally, we note that the fees awarded by the Arbitrator for 1993 are in connection with work performed by Becker in processing the attorney fee request with the Arbitrator. Reasonable fees for work done in relation to an attorney fee award are allowable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DODDS and FEA</span>, 54 FLRA 773, 791-93 (1998), provides another example of FLRA's review of a dispute over the reasonableness of the rate and time invested by lawyers who received a fee award through arbitration:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in determining the reasonableness of fee awards, the Authority considers whether the number of hours expended were reasonable and whether those hours, multiplied by the rate, "establish[&#8197;] an objective basis on which to make an initial estimate of the value of the lawyer's services." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 48 FLRA 931, 935 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>) (quotations and citations omitted). In doing so, the Authority examines an attorney's customary rates and the terms of any applicable fee agreement.[7] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Washington, D.C. and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3407</span>, 47 FLRA 1187, 1192 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In determining the market rate, "the Authority has held that 'where an applicant for a fee award has a prior billing history, the reasonable hourly rate will be counsel's established billing rate.'" <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 48 FLRA at 935 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force Headquarters, 832D Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 32 FLRA 1084, 1109 (1988)). "'[T]he rates charged in private representations may afford relevant comparisons' in determining the market rate." <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Washington, D.C. and Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook, New York</span>, 46 FLRA 1002, 1008 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895-96 n.11 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Blum</span>)). However, where the attorneys involved are also employees of a nonprofit organization that does not have a customary billing rate--such as a union--it is necessary to consider whether the rate requested is in line with the prevailing billing rate "'in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1009 (quoting <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. at 895-96 n.11).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2470"></span>In this case, the Arbitrator reviewed the information provided in the fee application and found that only one of the four attorneys requesting payment was entitled to fees because only that attorney represented the Union in connection with grievant Rooney--the prevailing party in the Merits Award. The Arbitrator specifically rejected any request for fees that were not associated with the representation of grievant Rooney because it was only that portion of the grievance that was sustained and only grievant Rooney was a "prevailing party" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). In this respect, the Arbitrator found that grievant Rooney had received the exact relief that he sought.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, in determining whether the number of hours expended by that attorney were reasonable, the Arbitrator reviewed the supporting affidavit and found that only 124 hours and $481.10 in costs--both being less than what was sought by the attorney--were expended with respect to grievant Rooney. In determining whether the hourly rate requested by that attorney was reasonable, the Arbitrator considered the hourly rate requested and the documentation provided in support of that request. The documentation examined by the Arbitrator included a report of market rate survey data, which the parties had utilized in the past without objection, providing the hourly rate of attorneys with specific years of experience in specific areas of legal expertise. In addition, the Arbitrator considered the fee rate that attorney has received since 1991, as well as the attorney's geographical location. After reviewing this documentation, and comparing the attorney's hourly rate request with that of other attorneys, the Arbitrator found that the attorney's rate was "not unreasonable and that the reasonableness of the fee criterion [under section 7701(g)] has been satisfied."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator properly reduced the fees awarded to compensate only one attorney, and reduced his recovery by the hours associated with the unsuccessful portion of the grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stein</span>, 65 MSPR at 690. In doing so, the Arbitrator clearly identified those hours that the attorney expended with respect to grievant Rooney's claim, and based on the finding that grievant Rooney's claim was successful, the Arbitrator awarded only those fees related to that claim. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 115 (holding that fee award was not reasonable because the plaintiff failed to prove an essential element of his claim--actual, compensable injury). Moreover, in arriving at the attorney fees award, the Arbitrator made specific findings to show how the hourly rate was determined and how the hours claimed were applied. Nothing in the record, nor the Agency's exceptions provide any basis for finding that the award of attorney fees is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may reduce time spent that is unnecessarily duplicative, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, and NTEU</span>, 71 FLRA 400, 404-05 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency claims that Attorney A performed work that was duplicative of other work during the 106.5 hours, "[i]t is only where the lawyer does unnecessarily duplicative work that the court may legitimately cut the hours."[57] And here, changes to the hearing schedule resulted in a large amount of hearing-preparation work. As the Arbitrator observed, the parties originally scheduled nine hearing dates to address all of the claims raised in the grievance. But after just two hearing days, the parties began settlement discussions, per the bifurcation agreement, that lasted over a year. Then, the parties scheduled another six hearing days. At that time, both parties had to prepare, or re-prepare, for hearing. Thus, even if some of Attorney A's hearing-preparation work was duplicative, it does not appear to be unnecessarily duplicative.</p>

FLRA required a more detailed explanation by the arbitrator of the propriety of the compensable hours:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award resolving a request for attorney fees under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) must set forth specific findings supporting determinations on each pertinent statutory requirement, <span class="Italic">e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr., Fort Bragg, N.C.,</span> 63 FLRA 524, 528 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Womack</span>), including the basis on which the reasonableness of the amount of any attorney fees was determined. <span class="Italic">Defense Distrib.,</span> 51 FLRA at 158. However, the Authority will not "simply find an award deficient that is not sufficiently explained or articulated." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.,</span> 58 FLRA 87, 92 (2002). Rather, in cases where the record permits the Authority to properly resolve the exception, the Authority will modify the award or deny the exception, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1061,</span> 63 FLRA 317, 321 n.5 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Local 1061</span>). If the record does not permit the Authority to resolve the exception, then the Authority will remand the award for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">Womack,</span> 63 FLRA at 528.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When exceptions concern standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g), the Authority looks to the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance. <span class="Italic">Local 1061,</span> 63 FLRA at 319. Under those standards, the computation of a reasonable attorney fee award "begins with an analysis of two objective variables: The attorney's customary billing rate; and the number of hours reasonably devoted to the case." <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 656, 662 (2006) (<span class="Italic">Stewart</span>). <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def, Def.

We address these two variables separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Reasonableness of the hourly rate</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MSPB regulations require, in pertinent part, that a motion for attorney fees be supported by evidence substantiating the amount of the request, including a "statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, with evidence that that rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a). Consistent with this regulation, the MSPB has found that the submission of a fee arrangement showing what the attorney charged the client per hour, and an affidavit in which the attorney attested that he charged other clients the same rate for similar work, is sufficient to demonstrate that the hourly rate claimed is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Stewart,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. at 663. In addition, the MSPB has upheld an administrative judge's determination as to the reasonableness of an hourly rate that was based in part on the administrative judge's knowledge of the hourly rates that were standard in her region. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 331, 34041 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Thomas</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union's attorney submitted a copy of the retainer agreement indicating a $200.00 hourly rate, Retainer Agreement, and asserted that $200.00 per hour is the customary rate that the firm charges the Union to handle its arbitration matters, and is "either at or below the standard in metropolitan Detroit[.]" Additionally, the Arbitrator found that the hourly rate charged by the Union's attorney was reasonable because it was lower than the standard rate charged in a city of comparable size. The evidence put forth by the Union is consistent with the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.203(a), and is sufficient to demonstrate that the hourly rate claimed is reasonable, <span class="Italic">see Stewart,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. at 663 and the Arbitrator's determination, based on his personal knowledge of standard hourly rates in the region, is consistent with MSPB precedent. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. at 340-41. Further, the Agency does not cite any contrary evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's finding that the requested rate is reasonable is contrary to law, and we deny the exception as to the reasonableness of the rate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Reasonableness of the number of claimed hours</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an arbitrator considers a union's request for attorney fees, such requests "must be closely examined to ensure that the number of hours expended was reasonable[,]" <span class="Italic">DOD,</span> 60 FLRA at 286 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Del Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.,</span> 57 FLRA 23, 26 (2001), because "the number of hours expended are not necessarily those 'reasonably expended.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force Headquarters, 832d Combat Support Group DPCE, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz.,</span> 32 FLRA 1084, 1101 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>). In addition, when an arbitrator makes a determination as to a union's request for attorney fees, the arbitrator must support his or her determination as to the reasonableness of the fee request. <span class="Italic">See Defense. Distrib.,</span> 51 FLRA at 158 (requiring specific findings as to the reasonableness of a fee award); <span class="Italic">cf. DOD,</span> 60 FLRA at 285 (finding arbitrator supported fee award). <span class="Italic">See also Luke AFB,</span> 32 FLRA at 1100 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983) (noting Court's statement that it is "'important' that [a] district court provide 'a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award[&#8197;]"'). The MSPB similarly requires that an administrative judge considering an attorney fee request "determine 'whether the hours claimed are justified' and...'make a judgment-considering the nature of the case and the details of the request, taking evidence if need be, and defending his judgment in a reasoned (though brief) opinion-on what the case should have cost the party[.]"' <span class="Italic">Casali v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 347, 354 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Casali</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB,</span> 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds,</span> 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the number of hours requested "seems reasonable" because the Union's attorney was "well prepared. However, there is no indication in the award that, in making that finding, the Arbitrator considered "the nature of the case and the details of the request," and he did not "defend[&#8197;] his judgment in a reasoned...opinion on what the case should have cost[.]" <span class="Italic">Casali,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. at 354. Thus, the Arbitrator did not make specific factual findings to support his conclusion that the amount of the fees requested is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, where an award does not sufficiently explain a determination that attorney fees meet the statutory requirements of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Authority will examine the record to determine whether it permits the Authority to resolve the matter, and if it does not, then the Authority will remand the award for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">Womack,</span> 63 <span id="page_2471"></span>FLRA at 528. In addition, both the Authority and the MSPB have held that the fact-finder is often in the best position to make determinations as to the reasonableness of the amount of attorney fees claimed. <span class="Italic">See Ala. Ass 'n of Civilian Technicians,</span> 56 FLRA 231, 235 (2000) (Chairman Wasserman dissenting in part) (the arbitrator, and not the Authority, is the appropriate authority for resolving a union request for attorney fees); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 152, 162 (2001) ("[T]he administrative judge is in the best position to evaluate the documentation submitted by counsel to determine whether the amount requested is reasonable, and to evaluate the quality of representation afforded by counsel[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the record contains the Union attorney's detailed billing record. However, the billing records alone do not indicate whether the amount of attorney fees requested is reasonable for, as noted above, "the number of hours expended are not necessarily those 'reasonably expended."' <span class="Italic">DOD,</span> 60 FLRA at 286 (quoting <span class="Italic">Luke AFB,</span> 32 FLRA at 1101). Therefore, we remand the matter as to the claimed number of hours to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator merely stated that the awarded “hourly rates and total legal charges" were based on a review of the “claimed legal fees" and “the attorneys' years of service, experience, specialties and practice areas, and prior rates charged and approved in all previous cases" provided by the Union. The Arbitrator further stated that the fees were “in accordance with the prevailing market rates in the relevant community," but did not identify the rate. These conclusory statements are insufficient. Additionally, the Arbitrator made no determination as to the reasonableness of the hours expended. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator failed to set forth sufficient factual findings to support the fee award.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority requires that fee requests "be closely examined to ensure that the number of hours expended was reasonable[,]" because "the number of hours expended are not necessarily those 'reasonably expended.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Def.

Additionally, an arbitrator must support his or her determination as to the reasonableness of a fee request. <span class="Italic">See Def. Distrib.</span>, 51 FLRA at 158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The standard of review as to the reasonableness of the number of hours awarded is deferential.&#x2003;In this connection, the MSPB has stated that the fact-finder is "in the best position to determine whether the number of hours expended is reasonable[.]" <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 404, 411 (2008). "[A]bsent a specific showing that the [fact-finder's] evaluation was incorrect," the fact-finder's evaluation will not be second-guessed. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 411. Consistent with this approach, the Authority has rejected an agency's "unsupported" exception to the number of hours that an arbitrator awarded a union attorney. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 23, 26 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not claim, and there is no basis in the record to find, that the Arbitrator's conclusion is contrary to the requirements of the above-cited precedent. Specifically, the Arbitrator closely examined the request to ensure that the number of hours expended were reasonable and supported his determination as to the reasonableness of the fee request. The Agency's claim that the Arbitrator dismissed its concerns regarding "proportionality or time spent[,]" or its claim that many of the hours should be billed at a clerical rate, does not indicate that the Arbitrator's conclusion is inconsistent with Authority precedent. Further, in view of the fact that the Arbitrator reduced the hours requested by fifty percent, the Agency's claim that the hours requested were "unnecessary" does not demonstrate that the Fee Award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the Fee Award is disproportionate to the amount of backpay, the Agency concedes that this consideration is merely one "<span class="Italic">factor</span>[&#8197;] relevant to the determination of a fee award[,]" and does not explain why, applied here, this one factor renders the Fee Award deficient. This is consistent with Supreme Court precedent holding that, with regard to another federal fee-shifting statute, the amount of damages recovered, while relevant to the amount of attorney fees to be awarded, is "only one of many factors that a court should consider in calculating an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">City of Riverside v. Rivera</span>, 477 U.S. 561, 574 (1986) (plurality) (<span class="Italic">Rivera</span>). <span class="Italic">Rivera </span>applies here. <span class="Italic">See City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557, 562 (1992) (Supreme Court's case law construing what is a "reasonable" fee applies uniformly to all federal fee-shifting statutes). As such, we find that the Agency has failed to show that the Fee Award is deficient on this ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the number of hours the Arbitrator awarded renders the amount of the Fee Award unreasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, and NTEU</span>, 71 FLRA 400, 404 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting) ("[T]he Authority has stated--relying on MSPB precedent--that because arbitrators are 'in the best position to determine whether the number of hours expended [was] reasonable,' it reviews those determinations under a 'deferential' standard. And the MSPB has held that 'absent a specific showing that the [presiding official's] evaluation was incorrect, [that evaluation] will not [be] second-guess[ed].' Applying that precedent, the Authority has rejected unsupported exceptions to the number of hours that an arbitrator awarded an attorney.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Little guidance is offered by FLRA concerning the level of detail or format required of counsel's time records. One case dismissed an agency's objection to redaction of time records to protect attorney work product with the observation that the agency did not show that it was prevented from conducting a review of the time records. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Ann Arbor and AFGE Local 2092</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-026.html">56 FLRA 216</a>, 225 (2000).

And both the MSPB and the Federal Circuit have stated that when a specific deficiency has been identified in an attorney-fee petition--such as inadequate documentation--the presiding official must afford the petitioning party an opportunity to correct that deficiency.").</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 62 FLRA 70, 70-73 (2007), vacating and remanding a merits award without prejudice to the union's right to resubmit a fee petition, the agency exceptions included an objection, considered insubstantial, to the manner that a fee agreement was provided to the arbitrator and not to the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to ruling on the Union's petition for attorney fees, the Arbitrator directed the Union to submit any fee agreement between it and its counsel. In a supplemental petition for fees, the Union submitted the fee agreement only to the Arbitrator, and not to the Agency. The Union alleged that the agreement contained confidential information and requested that the Arbitrator review the agreement <span class="Italic">in camera</span> and issue an order protecting the terms of the agreement from disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator's decision to conduct an <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection of the fee agreement and to release to the Agency only the hourly rate set forth in the agreement and the proviso for a reduced fee is deficient. The Agency argues that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2), a request for attorney fees must include a fee agreement when one exists. The Agency also argues that the claim of confidentiality cannot protect the terms of the agreement from disclosure. Consequently, the Agency requests that the Authority vacate the Arbitrator's order and order a copy of the agreement served on the Agency</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's arguments. Although the Agency is correct that the MSPB requires that fee agreements be disclosed to its judges, the MSPB will not disturb an award of fees if a failure to disclose the agreement does not prejudice the employing agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 84 MSPR 692, 695-96 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Miller</span>). Even assuming that this same rule applies in arbitration, the Union's motion for attorney fees filed with the Arbitrator did include a copy of the terms of the fee agreement consistent with &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2). Moreover, in the Union's supplement to its petition for attorney fees submitted to the Arbitrator and served on the Agency, the Union's attorney disclosed the relevant portion of the fee agreement as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Legal Fees. Client agrees to pay for legal services...at the following rates...:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">$423.00 per hour for attorney; $239 per hour for associate; $130 per hour for law clerk and paralegal. These rates will be adjusted every June 1, and will be consistent with the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. Client may be charged a reduced fee in the public interest, but agrees to pay the full fee upon receipt of a successful decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the fee agreement was provided to the Arbitrator and disclosed, in relevant part, to the Agency, the Agency was not prejudiced or prevented from adequately responding to whether the requested hourly rate was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Miller,</span> 84 MSPR at 696 (administrative judge's decision set aside only if prejudice to the agency). Thus, the Agency has failed to <span id="page_2472"></span>establish that the Arbitrator's refusal to release the entire fee agreement is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an attorney enters into an agreement with a union setting a reduced hourly rate, the reduced rate--and not the higher rate that counsel states represents his market rate--establishes the presumptive reasonable rate for a fee award, <span class="Italic">Ft. McClellan Educ. Ass'n and DOD, Ft. McClellan Sch.</span>, 56 FLRA 644, 645-46 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agreed-upon fee between client and counsel is presumptively the "maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded absent clear evidence to the contrary." <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1108 (citing <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 445, 455 (1980) (<span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>)). The presumption is rebuttable by convincing evidence that the counsel's customary rate for similar work is higher and either the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations or was provided only because of the client's inability to pay. <span class="Italic">See Gensberg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 MSPB 198, 206 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Gensberg</span>). To establish a higher customary billing rate, the applicant must furnish specific evidence concerning billing rates during the relevant time periods. Such evidence can include retainer agreements, court awards, fees agreed upon in settlements, and affidavits. <span class="Italic">See Luke AFB</span>, 32 FLRA at 1111-12; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1053 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union correctly points out that the Arbitrator did not specifically address the Union's claim that $250 per hour was, as a matter of law, the presumptive rate. However, for the reasons that follow, we conclude that <span class="Italic">de novo</span> application of applicable law to the facts of this case reveals that $200 per hour is the presumptive, reasonable hourly rate, and that there is insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption. As such, the award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> and relevant MSPB precedent establish that the presumptive reasonable rate is that actually billed to the client. Here, that rate is evidenced by the retainer agreement between the Union and the Union's counsel. Although the retainer agreement contains a statement that the counsel's "appropriate" rate is $250 per hour, the retainer agreement itself provides that the Union is to be charged $200 per hour. Accordingly, $200 is presumptively the maximum reasonable fee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this connection, the Union has not addressed the rate it was charged or provided evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that $200 per hour is the maximum reasonable rate. Specifically, there is no evidence that the reduced rate was premised on the Union's inability to pay a higher amount. <span class="Italic">See Gensberg</span>, 85 MSPB at 206. There also is no evidence that the $200 per hour charged the Union is not a reflection of marketplace considerations. In fact, the record supports the conclusion that the reduced rate is a product of marketplace considerations. In this regard, the Union president stated that the reduced rate was "in recognition of providing [the Union's counsel] with an 'anchor' client as he was starting his law practice."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we conclude that the award reducing the requested hourly fee is not contrary to law. In so doing, we note that, in <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, as here, the attorney charged a reduced fee to a union client. In awarding fees based on the actual, reduced fee, the MSPB noted that a reduced fee "is a normal commercial billing practice for legal practitioners with clients such as labor unions [that] are commonly expected, if not explicitly understood, to produce a high volume of legal business." <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, 2 MSPB at 455 n.11. The MSPB stated that "ordinary experience warrants the presumption that private law firms do not operate as [charitable] institutions, and that a bill rendered by such a firm accurately reflects the...maximum fee that is commercially reasonable under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 455. No reason is argued that the <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span> rationale does not also apply here.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an award of fees in <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1691-93 (1998), based on a "success rate" that the union agreed to pay if the grievance was successful. The success rate was higher than the rate charged to the union during the representation. FLRA disavowed any interest in determining whether the union actually paid the higher rate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attorney fees are incurred by an employee within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1) when an attorney-client relationship exists and the attorney has rendered legal services on behalf of the employee. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services, Social Security Administration and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1040, 1047 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). The necessary attorney-client relationship exists when, as here, the attorney represents the employee on behalf of a union. <span class="Italic">See. id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it is evident from the record, and the Arbitrator specifically found, that an attorney-client relationship existed, legal services were rendered, and the Union incurred an obligation to pay attorney fees on behalf of the grievants. Thus, the fees that resulted from the law firm's representation of the grievants in the initial arbitration were incurred by the grievants within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1047-48. Furthermore, the fee agreement clearly obligated the Union to pay the success fee on a favorable outcome. As there was a favorable outcome here, the success fee was incurred within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As recognized by the Arbitrator, the Agency does not dispute that a fee was incurred by the Union, but objects only to whether the Union actually paid the success fee. The matter of fee payments between client and attorney is not a consideration in determining the propriety of attorney fee awards under the Act. The Agency's focus on the amount of fees allegedly paid, rather than owed, provides no basis for finding the arbitration award deficient. In resolving disputes over attorney fees, both the Federal Circuit and the MSPB refuse to consider the mechanics of fee payments between counsel and client. <span class="Italic">See Jensen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 858 F.2d 721, 724 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 42 MSPR 115, 119 n.7 (1989). Similarly, in reviewing the amount of fees awarded, we will not address whether, or how much, employees or unions have actually paid their attorneys.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The reasonable rate for an award of attorney fees to a private attorney is generally the attorney's established billing rate. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 48 FLRA at 1053. The Agency has misconstrued this standard in asserting that the established billing rate of the Union's attorneys must be the $90 per hour rate provided for an unsuccessful outcome. The Agency's argument is similar to the position asserted by the agency in <span class="Italic">Francois v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 64 MSPR 191 (1994) (<span class="Italic">OPM</span>). In <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, the fee agreement limited the employee's liability to $3,000 if the appeal was unsuccessful. <span class="Italic">See</span> 64 MSPR at 196. The appeal was successful, and the administrative judge awarded the employee attorney fees in excess of $3,000 calculated on the basis of the attorney's hourly billing rate, as set forth in the fee agreement. The MSPB rejected OPM's argument that any award of attorney fees in excess of $3,000 was unreasonable because the employee's liability was limited to $3,000. The MSPB ruled that "[t]he administrative judge...correctly interpreted the agreement as limiting the appellant's liability to $3,000 in the event his appeal was unsuccessful, but not limiting on its face OPM's liability for attorney fees in the event the appellant prevailed in his appeal<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fee agreement in this case is even more explicit than the agreement in <span class="Italic">OPM</span>. This fee agreement expressly obligated the Union to pay the success fee if the result was favorable. Moreover, the Arbitrator specifically found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the law firm's non-retainer, billing rates were reasonable and consistent with prevailing market rates. Accordingly, the Agency provides no basis for finding deficient the Arbitrator's use of the firm's non-retainer billing rates in calculating the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">Later law likely precludes an enhancement of a market hourly rate for the degree of success or other factors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992). [Refer later in this chapter to "Contingency Arrangement."]</p>

FLRA determined that the focus is on the market where services are rendered, a result that changed to the market rate in the community where the attorney practices, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v58/58-017.html">58 FLRA 87</a>, 90 (2002), following a change in the practice before the MSPB, reflected by MSPB regulation, 5 CFR 1201.203(a)(3) (2002) (65 Fed.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2608 and SSA</span>, 63 FLRA 486, 487-88 (2009), increased the fees from the rate for the location of the hearing, Puerto Rico, to the rate for the location of counsel's office, Baltimore/Washington:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority follows the practices of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) to resolve issues arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g) concerning the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Corpus Christi,</span> 58 FLRA at 90-91. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(3), a petition for attorney fees must include "[a] statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, with evidence that that rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices[.]" The MSPB has thus concluded that the relevant community for purposes of determining the appropriate market rate for attorney fees is the community in which an attorney ordinarily practices. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 152, 161 (2001). Relying upon the MSPB's interpretation, the Authority has also concluded that the relevant market rates are the rates for the community in which an attorney <span id="page_2473"></span>ordinarily practices.<span class="Italic"> See Corpus Christi, </span>58 FLRA at 91. Of particular relevance here, the Authority has held that a union may recover attorney fees at the Washington, D.C. market rate when the union provides sufficient evidence to establish that its counsel's ordinary community of practice is Washington, D.C. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1938,</span> 61 FLRA 645, 646 (2006). In reaching this conclusion, the Authority held that unions are not required to establish that local counsel is unavailable.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator made no explicit finding as to the location of counsel's office, he stated that Union counsel's "home base" is Baltimore. In addition, the Union submitted counsel's affidavit, which asserts that counsel has been licensed in Maryland and has practiced in the Baltimore area since 1998. Union counsel also submitted a copy of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, which lists the applicable rates for an attorney with eight years of experience.[2] Based on the foregoing, we find that the record is sufficient to establish that Union counsel's ordinary community of practice is the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix sets forth the method for determining the appropriate rate for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area based on their qualifications and years of experience. <span class="Italic">See Laffey v. Northwest</span> <span class="Italic">Airlines,</span> 572 F. Supp. 354 (D.D.C. 1983). Use of an updated <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix was endorsed by the Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel,</span> 857 F.2d 1516, 1525 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The Court of Appeals subsequently stated that parties may rely on the updated <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix prepared by the United States Attorney's Office as evidence of prevailing market rates for litigation counsel in the Washington, D.C. area. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. District of Columbia,</span> 57 F.3d 1101, 1105 &#x0026; n.14, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 516 U.S. 1115 (1996).

<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Arbitrator's conclusion, the Authority has routinely applied the rates found in the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix to arbitration matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, United States Naval Academy, Nonappropriated Fund Program Div.,</span> 63 FLRA 100, 103 (2009); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1938,</span> 61 FLRA at 646; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C., </span>48 FLRA 931, 936 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Arbitrator's finding that Union counsel practices wherever the Union requires her services, <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span> and its progeny do not suggest that an attorney is not entitled to community rates merely because he or she routinely practices in locations outside of his or her office's location. In addition, neither the Arbitrator nor the Agency cite any authority that supports this conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Arbitrator's determination that the Puerto Rico rate was the appropriate rate for attorney fees is contrary to law. Accordingly, we grant the Union's exception and modify the Arbitrator's award to provide attorney fees at the Washington, D.C./Baltimore rate. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1938,</span> 61 FLRA at 646 (Authority modified arbitrator's award of attorney fees).</p>
<p class="noindent">Note the reference in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2608</span> to the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, a calculation basing counsel fees for the Washington, DC, and Baltimore metropolitan areas based upon the length of time an attorney has practiced law.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2608 and SSA</span>, 63 FLRA 486, 488 (2009), determined that travel time is compensable at an attorney's hourly rate and that travel costs are recoverable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An attorney's time spent traveling in connection with an arbitration hearing is recoverable as part of an award of attorney fees and is compensable at an attorney's normal billing rate. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-188, </span>46 FLRA 458, 466 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Crumbaker v. MSPB, </span>781 F.2d 191, 193 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">modified on rh'g at</span> 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). In addition, a prevailing party may receive travel and lodging expenses as part of an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. and Quarantine, </span>53 FLRA 1688, 1693 (1998) (arbitrator's award of airfare expense upheld);<span class="Italic"> AFGE, AFL-CIO,</span> 49 FLRA 1666, 1670 (1994) (arbitrator's award of lodging expense upheld). However, the Authority will not uphold an award of travel fees when the award is unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., Wash., D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 1187, 1197-98 (1993) (remanding award to arbitrator to determine whether several charges, including travel time, were reasonable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award of fees and expenses for travel is unreasonable, and should therefore be reversed, because the Union would not have incurred travel fees and expenses had it obtained counsel from the site of the arbitration, Puerto Rico. The Agency does not cite any precedent that holds that an award for travel fees and expenses must be denied or reduced because a union does not select local counsel. Further, as discussed above, the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span> that a union is not required to demonstrate that local counsel is unavailable in order to obtain attorney fees at the market rate where the counsel normally practices.<span class="Italic"> See Corpus Christi,</span> 58 FLRA at 90-91. Although <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi </span>did not address the issue of travel time, it did make clear that attorney fees cannot be reduced because a union does not obtain local counsel. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>As attorney fees encompass travel time, it logically follows that there is no basis for denying or reducing travel fees and expenses solely because the Union did not select local counsel. Accordingly, we find the Arbitrator's award of travel fees and expenses is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 64 FLRA 630, 632-33 (2010), made the point, over the dissent of Member Beck, that the Back Pay Act does not require examination of the union's decision to employ out of town counsel (involving travel expense that could have been avoided through use of local counsel):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the only factor in dispute is whether the awarded attorney fees are reasonable, we address only that issue. The Agency asserts that the travel fees are unreasonable and should be set aside because they were "unnecessarily incurred." According to the Agency, the Union's Baltimore staff attorneys could have handled the "straightforward" legal issues of the arbitration. Although the Agency frames its argument in terms of reasonableness, it is, essentially, a challenge to the Union's assignment of an out-of-town attorney to the case. However, Authority precedent is clear that the Union is not required to justify its decision under the Back Pay Act. In this regard, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Tex.,</span> 58 FLRA 87, 90-91 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Corpus Christi</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Martinez v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 152, 161 (2001)), the Authority made clear that failure to obtain local counsel is not a valid basis for reducing attorney fees. Although <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi </span>did not explicitly address travel time, the Agency has presented no authority that this holding should not apply with equal force to fees and costs associated with travel. Accordingly, we find that there is no basis to reduce attorney fees for Union counsel's reasonable travel solely because the Union chose not to assign a local attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the alternative, the Agency argues that Union counsel's travel time should be billed at a fraction of her normal rate. In addressing such arguments, the Authority applies the decisions of the MSPB and the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See Defense Finance,</span> 60 FLRA at 286. In accordance with that precedent, the Authority has previously held that attorney fees for time spent traveling in connection with an arbitration hearing are recoverable under the Back Pay Act and are compensable at an attorney's normal billing rate. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R5-188,</span> 46 FLRA 458, 466 (1992). <span class="Italic">See also Crumbaker v. MSPB,</span> 781 F.2d 191, 193 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified on reh'g,</span> 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Lopez v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 230, 236 (1992) (holding that travel time should be billed at the same hourly rate as the lawyer's normal working time). Based on the foregoing, Union counsel is entitled to compensation for travel time at her normal hourly rate. Accordingly, as the Agency has not established that the rate of billing was inconsistent with law, we find that the award is not contrary to law and deny the exception.</p>
