<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-58"><span class="space">c.</span> Splitting of Charge</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Charges may contain multiple elements. Splitting a unified charge was impermissible in <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, there were three charges against the employee. Two were dismissed outright by the Board. The surviving charge was that the employee "direct[ed] the unauthorized use of Government materials, manpower and equipment for other than official purposes." The Board resolved that the employee was acting with an official purpose, but that the employee acted without proper authorization. The penalty was mitigated. The Federal Circuit reversed the Board, concluding that no penalty should have been levied as to the remaining charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ erred in not requiring each of the elements of the first charge to be proved. <span class="Italic">See Naekel v. Department of Transp</span>., 782 F.2d 975 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see also Harvey v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd</span>., 802 F.2d 537, 544 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">accord Cresson v. Department of Air Force</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 178, 182-83 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bogdanowicz v. Department of Army</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 653, 655 (1983); <span class="Italic">Bavier v. Department of Transp</span>., 5 M.S.P.B. 73, 74, 4 M.S.P.R. 548 (1981). Burroughs was charged with "directing the unauthorized use of Government materials, manpower and equipment for other than official purposes," and the Army was required to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that Burroughs' action was both "unauthorized" and "for other than official purposes." It is not permissible for the MSPB to split a single charge of an agency into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original charge. If the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fall. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To be contrasted is the situation where more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge. In that case, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">See Fiorillo v. United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 795 F.2d 1544 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By failing to prove that Burroughs' action was for "other than official purposes," the Army failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to the first charge. Accordingly, the board erred as a matter of law in imposing a penalty on Burroughs based on a finding that only a portion of one charge was proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c). The decision of the MSPB is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> was explained, <span class="Italic">Acox v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 111, 113-14 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Charge (1): "Verbal abuse and physical threats made to another employee." The agency's statement of its charges is followed by a narrative, which alleges that the appellant made three statements to Wright. The agency did not specify that some of the statements constituted "verbal abuse," while other statements or actions constituted "physical threats." In the prehearing conference, the administrative judge interpreted charge (1) as actually containing two charges. The first charge was "verbal abuse," with three specifications, each corresponding to one of the statements the agency claimed the appellant made to Wright. The second charge was "physical threats," with three specifications, each based on one of the same statements claimed by the agency to be "verbal abuse." The administrative judge sustained two specifications of "verbal abuse," and found that the third statement, if made, was not verbal abuse. The administrative judge did not sustain any of the "physical threat" specifications. As explained below, without proof that the appellant physically threatened Wright, charge (1) cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may not split a charge into independent charges that are mere elements of the original charge and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Thus, under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, where the agency charged the appellant with "insolence and rudeness" on three occasions, the agency was required to prove that the appellant was both insolent and rude. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 73 MSPR 397, 401-02 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Burroughs).</span> Whether the <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> prohibition against charge-splitting applies depends on whether the charge is based on a single act or on more than one act. A charge that is based on more than one act can be divided into multiple charges, each corresponding to the separate acts alleged. If the agency's charge is based on a single act, however, then <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> requires the agency to prove all of the elements of the charge that it brings based on that act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span> the agency's charge contained three specifications, each of which was based on a single act, so for a specification to be sustained, the agency was required to prove both elements of the charge (insolence and rudeness). <span class="Italic">See also Edwards v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 174 (1994) (where the agency charged the appellant with "deliberate malpractice and falsification of records" based on "a single specified incident involving the appellant's use of someone else's initials on...inspection approval tags," under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> the agency was required to prove that the use of someone else's initials was both "deliberate malpractice" and "falsification").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is very similar to <span class="Italic">Hawkins</span>. Each of the specifications under charge (1), "verbal abuse and physical threats," is based on a separate single statement. Specification one alleges that the appellant verbally abused and physically threatened Wright on September 8, 1995, by saying: "I'll kick your little punk ass." Specification two alleges that the appellant verbally abused and physically threatened Wright on September 8, 1995, by saying: "I'll do something to you--you don't know me boy." Specification three alleges that the appellant verbally abused and physically threatened Wright on November 6, 1995, by asking: "Do you think I'm something to play with?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, therefore, was required to prove, with respect to each specification, that the particular statement was both "verbal abuse" <span class="Italic">and</span> a "physical threat." The agency does not argue that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant did not threaten Wright, and we have no basis for disturbing the administrative judge's finding. In the absence of the agency proving the "physical threat" element of the charge with respect to any of the three specifications, it failed to prove the charge. <span class="Italic">Cf. Edwards</span> (where the administrative judge mitigated a suspension for "deliberate malpractice and falsification" to a reprimand based on a finding that the appellant committed deliberate malpractice only, the Board reopened the appeal and found that the entire charge "must fall" because the agency did not prove falsification). Charge (1) is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sihota v. IRS</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2252.Opinion.11-13-2018.pdf">908 F.3d 1284</a>, 1288-90(Fed. Cir. 2018), applying <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> to an arbitrator's award mitigating an adverse action, remanded for further analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address whether the arbitrator had authority to impose a ten-day suspension even though Ms. Sihota did not willfully understate her tax liability. Ms. Sihota contends the only charge before the arbitrator was under section 1203(b)(9), which requires <span class="Italic">willful</span> understatement of federal tax liability. Because the arbitrator did not sustain this charge, Ms. Sihota argues the arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing a ten-day suspension. In response, the government asserts the ten-day suspension was properly based on Ms. Sihota's negligent failure to provide an accurate 2003 tax return, which was an alternate charge before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, we held the MSPB can impose a <span id="Page_3197"></span>penalty for a charge only if every element of the charge is proven. 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). We explained that "[I]t is not permissible for the MSPB to split a single charge of an agency into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. And we emphasized that "[i]f the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fail." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By contrast, the arbitrator may impose a lesser penalty if he "sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges...so long as the agency has not indicated either in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges." <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999). That is, the arbitrator may impose a penalty if he sustains one or more charges, but he cannot impose a penalty based on a portion of a single charge. <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 918 F.2d at 172; <span class="Italic">accord Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the only charge before the arbitrator was under section 1203(b)(9), then the arbitrator could not impose any penalty. Section 1203(b)(9) requires the IRS to remove any employee who willfully understates their federal tax liability. &#x00A7; 1203(b)(9), 112 Stat. at 721. Because the arbitrator held Ms. Sihota did not act willfully, he had no authority to impose <span class="Italic">any</span> penalty under section 1203(b)(9). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, it is impermissible to split a charge and impose a penalty based on a newly formulated charge. 918 F.2d at 172.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator could have, however, imposed a mitigated penalty if he had sustained an alternate charge against Ms. Sihota. <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260. Here, the arbitration decision explains the ten-day suspension was based on Ms. Sihota's negligence in obtaining a refund. The arbitrator found Ms. Sihota had failed "to timely pay her federal tax liability," and the IRS had authority to take corrective action based on her failure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Sihota argues the arbitrator could not base the suspension on alternate charges because those issues were not submitted for arbitration. "It is a settled rule that an arbitrator's authority is limited by the issues the parties present to him for decision; he must 'stay[ ] within the areas marked out for his consideration,' and may not go 'beyond the submission.'" <span class="Italic">Minn. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Mem'l Health Care</span>, 822 F.3d 414, 418 (8th Cir. 2016) (quoting <span class="Italic">United Steel Workers of Am. v. Enter. Wheel &#x0026; Car Corp</span>., 363 U.S. 593, 598 (1960)). The record of the arbitration hearing supports Ms. Sihota's contention that the only charge before the arbitrator was under section 1203(b)(9). During the hearing, the Union argued the final decision letter sustained the section 1203(b)(9) portion of the charge but did not sustain any alternative charges. And the arbitrator stated "the charge that is before me is the one that was sustained, which is 1203(b)(9) and not the alternative because the letter...says that the charge is 1203(b)(9)." Likewise, counsel for the IRS confirmed there are "no other charges that we're dealing with."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite this colloquy at the hearing, we are not convinced the arbitrator was foreclosed from imposing a mitigated penalty based on alternate charges. The Notice of Proposed Adverse Action listed a variety of allegations, including willful understatement of tax liability, failure to accurately state tax liability, and failure to timely pay tax liability. And the final removal letter stated "[a]ll reasons and specifications are sustained." Thus, it appears the IRS removed Ms. Sihota based on her failure to accurately state her tax liability <span class="Italic">in addition</span> to her alleged willful understatement of her tax liability. Indeed, it was undisputed that Ms. Sihota at least acted negligently. In her tax settlement agreement with the IRS, Ms. Sihota admitted she "acted negligently in obtaining a refund...resulting in an underpayment of the tax required." And at the arbitration hearing, the Union conceded "the taxpayer acted negligently in obtaining a refund."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From this record, we cannot discern which charges were properly considered by the arbitrator or which charges support the ten-day suspension. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the arbitrator must determine which charges were submitted for arbitration. If, as Ms. Sihota alleges on appeal, the only charge at issue was under section 1203(b)(9), then the arbitrator must reinstate Ms. Sihota without imposing any penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As an example of an agency's failure to prove a charge with multiple elements, in <span class="Italic">Roseberry v. VA</span>, 51 MSPR 172, 175 (1991), the appellant wrote a memo to a supervisor concerning a procedure he followed in his work. The memo contained an anecdote that the supervisor apparently found disturbing. The agency suspended the appellant for the charge of exhibiting insolent, insubordinate, and threatening behavior through his memo. The Board determined that the suspension could not be sustained because appellant's memo was not a threat to the supervisor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170 (Fed. Cir. 1990)] the court held that the Board may not sustain a charge where the agency fails to prove one of its elements by a preponderance of evidence. The agency charged the appellant with insolent, insubordinate, and threatening behavior as a single charge. It did not attempt to define which aspects of his memorandum constituted which element of the charged misconduct. Moreover, the charge arose from one factual specification set out to support it. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, if the agency fails to prove any one of the elements of the charge, the charge cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another appeal applying <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 653, 659 (1993), when an agency charged an appellant with distributing a controlled substance and being convicted for this conduct, the agency could not sustain the charge when it could not prove the conviction. In <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 365, 368, 371-72 (1994), the appellant was charged with "removal of Government property without proper authorization in violation of 43 CFR 20.735-15 [(1994)]." The agency's proof failed to establish both the improper removal of the property and the conversion offense referenced by the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. VA,</span> CH-0752-15-0367-I-1 (NP 3/10/2016) (charge of "disrespectful, intimidating language toward supervisor": "As for the agency's assertion that it fully proved the charge, we note that by virtue of the charge label, the agency was required to prove that the appellant's communications were both disrespectful <span class="Italic">and</span> intimidating. The administrative judge found that the agency proved that his communications were disrespectful, but not that they were intimidating."); <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 80 MSPR 294, 301 &#x00B6; 10 (1998) ("Where an agency's charge is based on a single incident, the Board may not split the charge into independent charges that are mere elements of the original charge and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Here, the agency's charge of 'defiance of authority and insubordination' was based on a single incident, the appellant's statement that he would not 'respond to or implement any dictated unreasonable and unfair managerial practices.' Accordingly, in the absence of the agency proving the 'insubordination' element of the charge, the entire charge must fail. <span class="Italic">Acox v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 111, 113-14 (1997).").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency must support the reasons for an adverse action by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)]. To examine whether the agency met this burden of proof, the Board must determine exactly what charges the agency brought against the appellant. the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; we may not substitute what we consider to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). The agency is not required to affix a label to a charge; it may simply describe actions that constitute misbehavior in narrative form in its charge letter. <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). If the agency chooses to label an action of alleged misconduct, however, then it must prove the elements that make up the legal definition of the charge, if any. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a single stated charge contains two separate acts of misconduct that are not dependent upon each other and that do not comprise a single, inseparable event, each act constitutes a separate charge. <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 565 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Generally speaking, a charge usually consists of two parts: (1) A name or label that generally characterizes the misconduct; and (2) a narrative description of the acts that constitute the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 203. The Board may not split a single charge into several independent charges and then sustain one of the newly-formulated charges, which represents only a portion of the original. <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. <span id="Page_3198"></span>1990). Whether the prohibition against charge-splitting applies depends on whether the charge is based on a single act or on more than one act. <span class="Italic">Acox v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 111, 114 (1997). A charge that is based on more than one act can be divided into multiple specifications or charges, each corresponding to the separate acts alleged. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the agency's charge is based on a single act, however, the agency must prove all the elements of the charge that it brings based on that act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Picariello v.

Applying these principles, we find that repeated acts of insubordination and repeated acts of discourtesy toward a supervisor are separate charges. Each is based on a different act, albeit one that occurred in the same conversation. Insubordination and discourtesy have different elements. One can be insubordinate without being discourteous and likewise one who is discourteous is not necessarily insubordinate....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency listed three specifications in support of its charge of threats, intimidation, and coercion of subordinate employees. Each specification constituted a distinct, independent event. In particular, the agency charged the appellant with having committed three separate acts of misconduct (threatening a subordinate employee, asking another employee to massage his back, and intimidating an employee into writing a report of contact) that are not dependent on each other and that do not together comprise a single inseparable act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Moreover, these acts of misconduct have different elements <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 105, 107 (1988) (distinguishing a charge of coercion from one of threats). Accordingly, we find that the agency's charge of "threats, intimidation, and coercion of subordinate employees" actually constitutes three different charges, each corresponding to the separate acts alleged. <span class="Italic">See Walker</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 7 (finding that the agency's charge constituted two separate charges where it contained two separate acts of misconduct that were not dependent on each other and that had different elements).</p>

A charge that is based on more than one act can be divided into multiple specifications or charges, each corresponding to the separate acts alleged. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency labeled the charge as "[m]isrepresentation or [c]oncealment" of facts on official documents and, in the narrative description of the charge, alleged that the appellant: (1) misrepresented the facts when he asserted that his injury was caused by being hit on the head with a forklift; and (2) concealed the fact that he had been in a fight with J.L. and had been hit on the head with a hammer. Thus, we find that the agency charged the appellant with having committed two separate acts of misconduct (misrepresenting facts and concealing facts on the incident report) that are not dependent on each other, have different elements of proof, and do not comprise a single inseparable act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Boo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2014) (distinguishing the elements of proof for a charge of falsification or misrepresentation from those of a charge of lack of candor). Accordingly, we modify the initial decision to find that, rather than a single charge of misrepresentation or falsification, the agency's charge of "Misrepresentation or Concealment of Facts on Official Documents" consists of two separate charges, one of which alleges that the appellant misrepresented facts on an official document, and the other of which alleges that he concealed facts on an official document. <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 7 (finding that an agency's charge constituted two separate charges when it contained two separate acts of misconduct that were not dependent on each other and that had different elements); <span class="Italic">see Texeira v.

We will address each charge individually.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the charges and the specifications are no more than a summary recitation constituting the charge and a factual narration explaining the charge, all components of the charge must be established if the agency is to prevail, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 174, 178-79 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the agency charged the appellant with "deliberate malpractice and falsification of records on 30 September 1991; second offense." In support of this charge, the agency specified as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On 30 September 1991 you were assigned to perform weekly inspections in # 2 Plant on the USS SOUTH CAROLINA. At the time you were assigned the job by your supervisor, Mr. D.W. Fleming, Pipefitter Foreman, you did not indicate that you had any questions about the job assignment. That afternoon Mr. J.D. Ellis, Pipefitter Leader, was stand-in supervisor. The next morning, 1 October 1991, Mr. Fleming was informed by RAD-CON that you performed the inspections as assigned, but instead of initialing and dated [sic] the inspection approval tags with your initials, you wrote the initials of Mr. Ellis on each tag. Mr. Fleming questioned you on 1 October 1991 on the matter and you stated you used someone else's initials because you were not sure if you were qualified to use your initials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your deliberate malpractice and falsification of records violates shipyard rules governing conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's charge of "deliberate malpractice and falsification" was based on a single specified incident involving the appellant's use of someone else's initials on the inspection approval tags. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the agency was required to prove both the "deliberate malpractice" and the "falsification" aspects to establish the charge<span class="Italic">. See Wolak v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 251, 258-59 (1992);<span class="Italic"> Roseberry v. Veterans Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 172, 175-76 (1991); <span class="Italic">Atwood v.
