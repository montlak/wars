<p class="Body-Text">On April 5, 2000, legislation was enacted reestablishing the MSPB as the adjudicator of cases of FAA employees. The Board's jurisdiction was earlier divested in 1996 by the DOT Appropriations Act. The subsequent Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century was retroactive. <span class="Italic">Blagaich v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 90 MSPR 619, 622 &#x00B6; 7 (2001), noted of the Ford Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board had already taken note of the effect of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 106-181, 2000 USCCAN (114 Stat.) 61 (the Ford Act) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122). That statute restored certain Board appeal rights that Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees had lost in 1996[1], and provides, at section 308(b)(1), for an election of remedies similar to that in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), but specific to the FAA, <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> it requires election among a Board appeal, a negotiated grievance, and an appeal through the agency's internal review process. <span class="Italic">See also Miller v. Department of Transportation,</span> 86 MSPR 293 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-50, 1995 USCCAN (109 Stat.) 436, 460, <span class="Italic">as amended by</span> Act of March 29, 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-122 &#x00A7; 1, 1996 USCCAN (110 Stat.) 876, 876, took effect April 1, 1996. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of Transportation,</span> 86 MSPR 293 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2000). That Act divested the Board of jurisdiction over removal actions and other actions appealable to the Board under Chapter 75 of Title 5 that are taken against employees of the FAA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roche v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 110 MSPR 286, 287-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 7-21, 2008 MSPB 247 (2008) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Roche v. MSPB</span>, 596 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined that, under the Ford Act, air traffic control specialists regained preexisting appeal rights, defined not to exceed the scope of 5 USC 7511:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until his removal, the appellant was employed as an air traffic control specialist at the agency's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In its notice of decision to remove him from that position, the agency advised him that he could appeal the action to the Board. The appellant subsequently filed a timely appeal of his removal with the Board's New York Field Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appeal was pending, the administrative judge to whom it was assigned issued an order indicating that the appellant might not be entitled to appeal his separation to the Board. He stated in the order that the appellant had been employed by the agency for less than 2 years at the time of his separation; that the record indicated that he was employed in the excepted service and was not a preference eligible; and that there was a question, under those circumstances, as to whether he was covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, a section the administrative judge described as providing "the definition of an employee in the excepted service who [could] appeal [his removal] to the Board..."<span class="Italic"></span> The administrative judge therefore ordered the appellant to show that his appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction, and he ordered the agency to file a response addressing the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_280"></span>In their responses to the administrative judge's order, the appellant and the agency both argued that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) was inapplicable to this case, that the appellant's entitlement to appeal was governed by the FAA's own personnel management system (PMS), and that, under the PMS, the appellant was an "employee" entitled to appeal his removal. The appellant also argued that he was entitled to appeal even if the definition in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 applied because the kind of position he had held had formerly been in the competitive service or, in the alternative, because he was a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1) and 7513(d), an individual who meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) generally is entitled to appeal his removal to the Board. Effective April 1, 1996, the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 104-50 &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995), as amended by Pub. L. No. 104-122, &#x00A7; 1, 110 Stat. 876, 876 (1996), divested the Board of jurisdiction over those appeals insofar as they were filed by FAA employees, and it required the FAA to develop and implement a personnel management system for its own workforce. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Transportation,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 293, &#x00B6; 4 (2000). In 2000, however, Congress enacted the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 106-181, 114 Stat. 61 (Ford Act). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> That act revised 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g), providing in paragraph (3) of that section that "an employee of the [FAA] may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board...from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." Ford Act, &#x00A7; 307(a), 114 Stat. 61, 125. Because FAA employees generally were entitled to appeal their removals to the Board before April 1, 1996, they are again entitled to appeal them under the Ford Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wright v. Department of Transportation,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6; 9 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 49 of the U.S. Code does not define the word "employee" for purposes of section 40122(g)(3). We must decide, therefore, what meaning Congress intended in enacting this provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its ordinary usage, the word "employee" would appear to mean any person who works for another. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 543 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "employee" as a "person who works in the service of another person...under an express or implied contract of hire, under which the employer has the right to control the details of work performance"). In the context of section 40122(g)(3), however, this meaning is clearly too broad. If applied here, it would include political appointees, as well as those who, with no prior federal service, have just begun to work for the FAA. Nothing in the Ford Act or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to confer Board appeal rights on such a broad range of individuals. It appears, therefore, that a narrower definition, intended to be applied in the federal employment context, should be applied here. FAA's PMS and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) each provide a definition that is arguably applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the appellant argues that the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) is not applicable to him, and that the applicable definition is instead the definition of "employee" that is provided in the FAA's PMS. In support of this argument, he refers to 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2), which provides that, except for the sections and chapters listed in that paragraph, the provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code do not apply to the FAA. As the appellant notes, neither section 7511 nor any other section of chapter 75 is listed in section 40122(g)(2). The appellant asserts, therefore, that the definition of "employee" that applies here is that in the FAA's PMS, and he notes that the agency agrees with him that the Board has jurisdiction over this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that the agency's concurrence in the appellant's position that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal does not establish that this position is correct, and does not relieve the Board of the responsibility of making its own determination on the subject. <span class="Italic">See Heath v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (while parties may stipulate to facts, the ultimate question of jurisdiction is a legal matter not subject to stipulation). Moreover, the Board has consistently held that the definition of "employee" that is provided in section 7511(a)(1) is applicable to cases such as this. In <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 12 (2006), for example, the Board addressed the issue of whether it had jurisdiction, under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g), over the removal appeal of an FAA employee; it stated that it could exercise jurisdiction over such an appeal if the appellant met the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511; and it found that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant met the criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). In other cases, it has also applied 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) in determining whether an FAA employee has appeal rights under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). <span class="Italic">E.g., Coleman v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 564, &#x00B6; 4 (2006); <span class="Italic">Zambito v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 550, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8-13 (2005); <span class="Italic">Connolly v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 16 (2005).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the appellant argues that <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer</span> and <span class="Italic">Zambito</span> "do not fully support the" administrative judge's findings regarding jurisdiction, we disagree. In those cases, the Board directly addressed the effect of the statutory provision that is at the heart of this case, i.e., 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3), and directly addressed the issue of which individuals were entitled to appeal their involuntary separations to the Board under that provision. <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8; <span class="Italic">Zambito,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. It also applied the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 in determining whether the appellants in those cases were "employees" entitled to appeal their separations to the Board. <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Zambito,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that our reviewing court, whose precedent is binding on us, <span class="Italic">see Fairall v. Veterans Administration,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39,<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987), has taken the same position. In <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 439 F.3d 1329, 1332-34 (Fed. Cir. 2006), it held that an individual claiming a right to appeal to the Board under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122 could file such an appeal only if he met the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and it proceeded to apply that definition to the plaintiff in that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues, in effect, that, although Congress restored FAA employees' right to appeal certain actions, it did not restore the statutory provisions defining the categories of individuals who could appeal those actions. Before the enactment of the 1996 legislation mentioned above, however, the Board did not have jurisdiction over all removals. Instead, it had jurisdiction over only those that were appealable under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, i.e., removals of individuals who met the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), who were not otherwise excluded by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b), and whose removals were not excluded from Board jurisdiction by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(A), (B), (D), or (E). We see nothing in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g), or in the legislative history of that section, that reflects any congressional intent to expand the Board's jurisdiction beyond what it had prior to April 1, 1996. In fact, the language of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) that is quoted above providing the right to appeal "any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996" is inconsistent with any such intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant seems to argue that paragraph (h) of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122 supports his position. Under that paragraph, an FAA employee "who is the subject of a major adverse personnel action may contest the action either through any contractual grievance procedure that is applicable to the employee as a member of the collective bargaining unit or through the [FAA's] internal process relating to review of major adverse personnel actions..., or under section 40122(g)(3)." According to the appellant, construing the third of these alternatives i.e., an appeal to the Board under section 40122(g)(3) as applying only when the removed individual is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 would be inconsistent with the language of paragraph (h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The paragraph that immediately follows the one quoted above, however, i.e., paragraph (i) of section 40122, is inconsistent with this argument. That paragraph generally prohibits an individual from pursuing more than one of the three alternatives described in paragraph (h). It does so by providing that, <span class="Italic">"[w]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">here a major adverse personnel action may be contested through more than one of the indicated forums (such as the contractual grievance procedure, the [FAA's]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> internal process, or that of the Merit Systems Protection Board),</span> an employee must elect the forum through which the matter will be contested" (emphasis added). The language of this paragraph makes clear that not all "major adverse personnel actions" that may be appealed under the first or second of the alternatives listed in paragraphs (h) and (i) "may be contested through more than one of those three alternative forums. Some of them, under this language, may be appealable under one forum but not under another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that we addressed a somewhat similar matter in a case we decided shortly after the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the present case. In <span class="Italic">Hart v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 810 (2008), we held that the FAA's PMS, and not 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, defined the procedural protections to which an employee affected by an adverse action was entitled. This holding is not inconsistent with a holding that the Board's jurisdiction over removals of FAA employees is determined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. Nothing in the Ford Act or elsewhere provides that the procedures to be followed in effecting adverse actions are to be the same under that act as they were prior to April 1, 1996. As we have noted above, however, that act does provide that the appeal rights it was restoring in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) were to be the same rights that existed on March 31, 1996. Because only FAA employees who were covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 were entitled on that date to appeal their removals to the Board, only those who meet that section's definition of an "employee" are entitled to appeal their removals to the Board under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the appellant argues, in the alternative, that, even if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 is applicable, he meets the requirements of <span id="Page_281"></span>that section. Specifically, he asserts that FAA employees were part of the competitive service until April 1, 1996; he notes that competitive service employees are "employees" under section 7511(a)(1) if they have completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions; and he states that he meets this criterion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted above, however, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) restored the right to appeal "any <span class="Italic">action</span> that was appealable to the Board...as of March 31, 1996" (emphasis added). The action at issue here is the appellant's removal from an excepted service position. Evidence that positions such as that held by the appellant would have been in the competitive service on that date is immaterial to the jurisdictional issues here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that he is a preference eligible, and that his appeal right therefore should be determined based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), rather than on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). The administrative judge addressed this argument below and found that the appellant was not a preference eligible. We see no error in that finding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(D) (providing preference for 180 days or more of service on "active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38"); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21) (excluding active duty for training from the definition of "active duty").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was removed from a position in the excepted service, because he is not a preference eligible, and because he had less than 2 years of current continuous service at the time of the removal, he is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). The Board therefore lacks jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roche v. MSPB</span>, 596 F.3d 1375, 1376-83 (Fed. Cir. 2010), affirmed the Board's analysis, with the result that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal of Mr. Roche, who lacked sufficient time in service to qualify as an excepted service employee with a Board appeal right under 5 USC 7511:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Roche's employment with the FAA lasted a total of 562 days, or approximately 1.55 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA's letter informing Roche of his impending removal notified him that he could appeal its decision in one of three ways: through the contractual grievance procedure available to members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, through the FAA's internal personnel-action review process, or by appeal to the Board. Roche filed a timely appeal with the Board on September 20, 2007, and an Administrative Judge ("AJ") conducted a three-day hearing in his case between December 4, 2007 and December 6, 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 25, 2008, before reaching a final decision, the AJ issued an order to show cause as to why Roche's appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Roche does not fall under the definition of employee set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. Roche responded with many of the same arguments he now presents as to why &#x00A7; 7511 does not apply to his case, including the unique nature of the FAA's personnel system and the narrow coverage of Title 5 of the United States Code ("Title 5") with respect to FAA employees. In the alternative, Roche maintained that he needed only one year of current continuous service to qualify as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511, both because Air Traffic Control Specialist should be considered a "competitive service" position under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), and because his service in the Gulf War qualified him as "preference eligible in the excepted service" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). In a separate response to the AJ's show cause order, the FAA supported Roche's position that Title 5's definitional provisions do not apply to FAA employees, but disagreed that Roche qualifies as preference eligible or as a member of the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 30, 2008, the AJ issued an initial decision applying &#x00A7; 7511 and dismissing Roche's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ found that Roche's employment did not constitute competitive service, that he did not qualify for preference eligible status, and that he did not work for long enough to qualify as an excepted service employee. Roche appealed the AJ's initial decision, and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association filed an <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> brief in support of Roche's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board affirmed on December 8, 2008, determining that the definitional provisions in &#x00A7; 7511 apply to Roche. In so holding, the Board relied on its own finding in prior cases that &#x00A7; 7511 applies in FAA removal appeals, as well as this Circuit's indication in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 439 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2006), that an individual appealing to the Board under 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122 must meet the definition of employee in &#x00A7; 7511. If it were instead to apply the FAA's definition of employee, the Board reasoned that a larger category of individuals would be able to appeal than could have appealed as of March 31, 1996, and Congress expressed a clear intent in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) to restore the Board's jurisdiction over only those individuals who could have appealed as of March 31, 1996. The Board then rejected Roche's alternative arguments that he qualifies as a competitive service employee and that he is entitled to preference eligible status. Because it found that Roche does not qualify as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511, the Board dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;Statutory Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to "provide for greater flexibility in the hiring, training, compensation, and location" of FAA employees, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(a), Congress established an FAA Personnel Management System as part of the 1996 Department of Transportation and Related Agency Appropriations Act ("DOT Act"), Pub.L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122). The terms of the original DOT Act exempted all but seven provisions of Title 5 from the Personnel Management System:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The provisions of title 5, United States Code, shall not apply to the new personnel management system developed and implemented pursuant to subsection (a), with the exception of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;section 2302(b), relating to whistleblower protection;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;sections 3308-3320, relating to veterans' preference;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;section 7116(b)(7), relating to limitations on the right to strike;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;section 7204, relating to antidiscrimination;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;chapter 73, relating to suitability, security, and conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;chapter 81, relating to compensation for work injury; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;chapters 83-85, 87, and 89, relating to retirement, unemployment compensation, and insurance coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub.L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995). Because this list did not include the Board's jurisdictional grant in Chapter 77 of Title 5, this court held in two decisions that FAA employees could no longer appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Diefenderfer v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 194 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear whistleblower claims by FAA employees who were otherwise covered by federal whistleblower protection statute); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 127 F.3d 1074, 1076 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear an FAA employee's appeal of removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dissatisfied with the DOT Act's foreclosure of appeal rights to the Board, Congress passed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century ("the Ford Act") in 2000, which restored the Board's jurisdiction to hear appeals from FAA employees.<span class="Italic"> See</span> Pub.L. No. 106-181, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307(a), 308(b), 114 Stat. 61 (2000) (codified as amended 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H) &#x0026; (g)(3)). The Ford Act added an eighth category to the list of Title 5 provisions still applicable to the FAA's Personnel Management System.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H) (listing "sections 1204, 1211-1218, 1221, and 7701-7703, relating to the Merit Systems Protection Board" as a new "exception" to the general rule that "provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system"). The Ford Act then clarified in a subsequent provision that "an employee of the Administration may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). Neither the Ford Act nor the DOT Act directly addresses what definition of "employee" courts should use in determining the Board's jurisdiction over appeals by FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;Applicable Definition of "Employee"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Roche's appeal is unique in that the propriety of the Board's decision declining to exercise jurisdiction hinges on the applicable definition of the word "employee"--and, more specifically, whether the FAA's internal definition or &#x00A7; 7511's definition should apply. Under the FAA's definition, personnel who are "not serving a probationary or trial period, or...[have] served more than one year of service on a temporary appointment" qualify as employees. Under &#x00A7; 7511, on the other hand, an individual in an excepted service position like Roche only qualifies as an employee if he "has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). Because the parties do not dispute that Roche, who worked for the FAA for 1.55 years, qualifies as an employee under the FAA's regulations but not under &#x00A7; 7511's definition, the Board was correct to decline jurisdiction if the definition set forth in &#x00A7; 7511 governs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At first glance, it might seem incongruous that even after the passage of the Ford Act--a statute designed to reinstate the opportunities for litigants to appeal to the Board--the Board would lack jurisdiction over Roche's appeal. However, an analysis of the relevant provisions of the Ford Act and this Circuit's precedent leads both to the affirmative conclusion that the definitional provisions in &#x00A7; 7511 should apply to Roche's appeal, and to the reverse conclusion that the FAA's definition should not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The history and text of the Ford Act demonstrate that in order to restore the Board's jurisdiction to its March 31, 1996 status, Congress incorporated by reference several sections of Title 5 not specifically enumerated in the Ford Act itself. Between 1996, when Congress passed the DOT Act, and 2000, when it passed the Ford Act, the Board did not have jurisdiction over any FAA appeals and, as such, FAA personnel lost <span id="Page_282"></span>their previous status as employees under &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">See Allen,</span> 127 F.3d at 1076 (holding that petitioner could not appeal his removal from FAA employment to the Board because petitioner had lost his status as an "employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511"). With the goal of reinstating "the right of FAA employees to submit appeals to the MSPB," <span class="Italic">see</span> S. Rep. No. 106-9, at 36 &#x00A7; 425 (1999), &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) of the Ford Act states that "employees" may appeal "from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). Section 40122(g)(3) problematically does not, however, specifically list those laws, rules, or regulations that made certain actions appealable to the Board before April 1, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do the sections of Title 5 listed in &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H) of the Ford Act contain all of those laws, rules, and regulations. Of particular relevance to this case, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1) and 7513(d) are not among those sections listed in the Ford Act, and yet these are the provisions making removal actions like Roche's appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Allen,</span> 127 F.3d at 1076 (explaining that these provisions make FAA removal decisions appealable to the Board). Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, one of the sections that the Ford Act lists as now applying to the FAA, details the appellate procedures available to FAA personnel, that section (like &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3)) does not independently provide the Board with jurisdiction over specific types of actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) ("An employee...may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then becomes whether sections of Title 5 other than those specifically enumerated in the Ford Act may be invoked to give the Board jurisdiction over particular types of matters. "It is axiomatic that statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further supporting the interpretation that Congress incorporated by reference certain laws, rules, and regulations--namely, &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d)--&#x00A7; 7513(d) itself refers to "section 7701" as the means by which "an employee against whom action is taken under this section" may "appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). In this Circuit's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi,</span> we reasoned that the Board had jurisdiction over a petitioner's removal action under &#x00A7; 7513(d) because the petitioner could have appealed to the Board under this provision as of March 31, 1996, and the Ford Act restored jurisdiction over actions that could have been heard on March 31, 1996. <span class="Italic">See</span> 439 F.3d at 1332; <span class="Italic">see also Van Wersch,</span> 197 F.3d at 1147 (explaining that pursuant to &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d), a removal is one of the actions appealable to the Board under &#x00A7; 7701); <span class="Italic">Goldberg v.

When Congress restored to FAA employees the appeal rights that they had before the DOT Act went into effect on April 1, 1996, therefore, we find that Congress incorporated by reference "law[s], rule[s], and regulation[s]" like the one allowing the appeal of removals set forth in &#x00A7; 7512 and &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Roche points to this Circuit's interpretation of the Ford Act in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation,</span> 551 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hart v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 280 (2008), to support his position that the Ford Act did not incorporate &#x00A7; 7512 and &#x00A7; 7513. However, neither case is inconsistent with our conclusion here. In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez,</span> we held that because we must construe waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly, we could not "create an exception" making an award of back pay under the Back Pay Act "available to FAA employees where the language of &#x00A7; 40122 denies that remedy."<span class="Italic"> See Gonzalez,</span> 551 F.3d at 1375. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez,</span> where we found that none of the eight enumerated exceptions in &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(h) of the Ford Act lists or refers to the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 1375, we conclude here that the general language of the Ford Act incorporates &#x00A7; 7512 and &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Roche's reliance on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hart</span> is similarly misplaced. Although <span class="Italic">Hart</span> held that the FAA's Personnel Management System, not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), sets forth the procedural protections to which an employee is entitled before being placed on enforced leave, it did not address the Board's jurisdiction over removals of FAA employees or the definition of employee that should apply. <span class="Italic">See Hart,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. at 285. Moreover, unlike &#x00A7; 7513(d), which specifically grants appeal rights to the Board "under section 7701," &#x00A7; 7513(b) does not refer to any section of Title 5 enumerated in the Ford Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. Thus, the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Hart</span> is not inconsistent with this Court's finding that the Board correctly concluded that &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d) apply to FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, in arguing that &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d) do not apply to confer jurisdiction over his appeal, Roche fails to provide an alternative basis for the Board's jurisdiction. Roche attempts to analogize to the Board's initial decision in <span class="Italic">Jewell v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> where it determined that the jurisdictional basis for a petitioner's appeal came from a TSA internal directive establishing that removals may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> DE-0752-05-0091-1-1, 2005 MSPB LEXIS 2860 (M.S.P.B. May 19, 2005) (Initial Decision), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 63 (2005). Even though Roche maintains that the jurisdictional concerns in this case "are identical to those addressed in <span class="Italic">Jewell,"</span> Roche fails to identify any comparable directive in the FAA regulations that gives the Board jurisdiction over his case. "The jurisdiction of the Board is not plenary. Rather, it is limited to those matters specifically entrusted to it by statute, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Van Wersch,</span> 197 F.3d at 1146 (citing<span class="Italic"> Todd v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 55 F.3d 1574, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). Because the FAA's definition of employee is not itself a jurisdictional grant, and parties may not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a tribunal like the Board, <span class="Italic">see Zumerling v. Marsh,</span> 783 F.2d 1032, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1986), Roche presents no viable alternative to &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d) that would give the Board jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's inquiry does not end there, however, because the fact that provisions for appeal of removal actions (&#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d)) are applicable to FAA employees does not necessarily mean that the Board should apply the definition of "employee" set forth in &#x00A7; 7511. Again beginning with the language of the relevant statutes, <span class="Italic">see Van Wersch,</span> 197 F.3d at 1148, the jurisdictional grant in &#x00A7; 7513(d) applies to "an employee against whom action is taken." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Just as &#x00A7; 7513(d) refers to &#x00A7; 7701 as the provision under which an employee may appeal to the Board, &#x00A7; 7511 refers to the rest of the subchapter, including 7513(d), when it provides a definition of employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 ("(a) For purposes of this subchapter--(1) "employee" means--...."). Thus, &#x00A7; 7511 appears to be incorporated by reference in the same way that &#x00A7; 7512(1) and &#x00A7; 7513(d) are incorporated to by reference. <span class="Italic">Cf. Orquera v. Ashcroft,</span> 357 F.3d 413, 418-19 (4th Cir. 2003) (explaining that "legislators frequently employ" phrasing like "as in effect before October 1, 1996" to "preserve through incorporation by reference a concept, definition, or specific analytic structure set out in a repealed or preamendment statute"). Moreover, because the definition of "employee" in &#x00A7; 7511 applied prior to April 1, 1996 to limit the Board's jurisdiction, incorporating this definition into the Ford Act's statutorial scheme is the only way to ensure Congress's purpose of resurrecting the right to appeal by the same "employees" who could have appealed "as of March 31, 1996." <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two of this Circuit's decisions support the conclusion that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that &#x00A7; 7511 applies. First, in a case decided before the DOT or Ford Acts, we described the interrelationship between the law providing the basis for the Board's jurisdiction and the definition of "employee" within that law: "the extent of the [B]oard's jurisdiction depends upon the particular definition of 'employee' in the law, rule or regulation which forms the underlying basis for the Board's jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See Antolin v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 895 F.2d 1395, 1396-97 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Applying this principle, the definition of employee in chapter 75 (provided in &#x00A7; 7511) would appear to apply, because the basis for the Board's jurisdiction over FAA removal claims like Roche's is found in that chapter. Second, in a more recent case applying the terms of the Ford Act, we found that "TSA personnel who meet the definition of 'employee' under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 may appeal his or her removal action to the MSPB."[5] <span class="Italic">Coradeschi,</span> 439 F.3d at 1332. Although <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span>'s actual holding addressed the sufficiency of the petitioners factual allegations that he qualified as an employee under &#x00A7; 7511, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 1333-34, in describing the relevant statutory authority we stated that the definition of employee in &#x00A7; 7511 should apply to determine the Board's jurisdiction over removal actions, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1332. Our reasoning in <span class="Italic">Coradeschi</span> thus further supports our determination here that the Ford Act did not simply grant appellate jurisdiction according to the procedures of &#x00A7; 7512 and &#x00A7; 7513 to FAA employees, but incorporated any definitional references contained within chapter 75 as part of that appellate scheme.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;TSA employees are subject to the FAA's Personnel Management System except to the extent that the Department of Homeland Security modifies that system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n); 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(h)-(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Several decisions of the Board have also determined that the definitional provisions in &#x00A7; 7511 apply. Each of these cases cites to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511, 7512, and 7513 with the parenthetical explanation: "providing 'employees,' as defined in Section 7511(a), with the right to appeal removals and other adverse actions to the Board." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cruz-Packer v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 64, 67 (2006) <span id="Page_283"></span>(assuming jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a Transportation Security Administration employee as long as that individual "meets the definition of an 'employee' under" &#x00A7; 7511); <span class="Italic">Zambito v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 550, 552 (2006) ("Under the personnel management system that is applicable to FAA employees, the removal of an individual who meets the definition of an 'employee' under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 may be appealed to the Board."); <span class="Italic">Connolly v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 422, 425 (2005) (same); <span class="Italic">Lara v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 423, 429 (2004) (assuming that &#x00A7; 7511 applies to determine whether a potential appellant qualifies as a TSA "employee").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Roche relies solely on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Jewell,</span> 2005 MSPB LEXIS 2860, for the proposition that the FAA's definition of "employee" should apply. In<span class="Italic"> Jewell,</span> the AJ reasoned that the Board should look to the definitions set forth in the FAA's Personnel Management System, because &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7513, "which provide definitions, actions covered, and cause and procedure, do not apply" under the language of the Ford Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Not only does this decision have no precedential value, <span class="Italic">see Rockwell v. Dep't of Commerce,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 217, 222 (1998), but the Board's denial of review does not indicate agreement with the AJ's reasoning because the Board may deny a petition if the error is not outcome determinative. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (explaining that if an adjudicatory error is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights, it does not provide a basis for reversal). Moreover, as explained above, although the FAA's internal regulations provide a definition of employee, they fail to supply the crucial jurisdictional grant that the TSA's internal regulations supplied in <span class="Italic">Jewell,</span> and that led to the Board's determination that the FAA's definition should apply. <span class="Italic">See Jewell,</span> 2005 MSPB LEXIS 2860.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the affirmative evidence that &#x00A7; 7511's definition of "employee" should apply to Roche's appeal, the court also finds persuasive the lack of evidence that Congress intended to expand the category of FAA personnel who could appeal to the Board beyond what was permitted on March 31, 1996 through use of the broader definition of "employee" provided in the FAA's regulations. As the Board noted in its decision below, applying the FAA's definition would expand the category of those who could appeal to political appointees and those who just began working for the FAA. <span class="Italic">See Roche v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 286, 289 (2008). We cannot infer a significant change in the law "unless an intent to make such a change is clearly expressed." <span class="Italic">See John R. Sand &#x0026; Gravel Co. v. United States,</span> 552 U.S. 130, 136 (2008) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Keene Corp. v. United States,</span> 508 U.S. 200, 209 (1993)). Thus, this court will not infer Congress's intent to widen the category of personnel who qualify as "employees" without a clear expression of its intent to do so. Indeed, the language of &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) expresses the opposite intent--that is, to grant appeal rights to the same category of individuals who could appeal before April 1, 1996. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3) (providing the right to appeal "any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unfortunate that the Board's denial of jurisdiction leaves Roche with no other avenue for appeal, as his two other administrative options are now time-barred. For the reasons explained above, however, this court does not find that the Board erred in determining that the definition of "employee" set forth in &#x00A7; 7511 applies to Roche's appeal. The parties do not dispute that Roche's term of employment was too short to qualify under &#x00A7; 7511, and, as such, the Board rightly dismissed his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

Section 307(a) of the Ford Act amended the 1996 Act by revising 49 USC &#x00A7; 40122(g). The new section 40122(g)(3) states that "under the new personnel management system [for FAA employment matters], an employee of the [FAA] may submit an appeal to [the Board] and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." 114 Stat. 61, 125.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Ford Act contains a general applicability provision that precludes the Board from exercising jurisdiction over this appeal.

The agency contends that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the November 22, 1996 removal action because the agency took that action before the fiscal year which began on October 1, 1999. The issue certified on interlocutory appeal is whether section 3 of the Ford Act applies so as to preclude the Board from exercising jurisdiction over this appeal, or whether the effective date in section 307(a)(4) of the Act applies.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has provided no legislative history in support of its argument that the general effective date of the Ford Act is not subject to specified exceptions that are set forth in other sections of the Act, as indicated by the phrase "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided." Nor are we aware of any legislative history that would support the agency's contention. As discussed above, the section of the Ford Act that applies to this <span id="Page_284"></span>appeal, section 307, plainly provides that it "shall take effect on April 1, 1996." In order to give effect both to the qualifying phrase "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided" in section 3 and to the express provision that section 307 "shall take effect on April 1, 1996," we find that Congress made section 307 retroactive to April 1, 1996, as an exception to the general effective date for other provisions of the Ford Act. This result is further supported by the fact that making section 307 retroactive to April 1, 1996, restored Board appeal rights to FAA employees under chapter 75 starting the day after such rights had been taken away in the 1996 Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that section 307 of the Ford Act is not a new provision, but copies section 347 of the 1996 Act which gave the agency the authority, effective April 1, 1996, to establish a new personnel management system. The agency asserts that section 307 therefore merely recodified the implementation date for the internal FAA personnel management system and does not evidence an intent by Congress to retroactively provide FAA employees with Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 307 did not simply recodify section 347 of the 1996 Act. Rather, section 307 contains the added provision that, under the new personnel system, "an employee of the [FAA] may submit an appeal to [the Board] ...from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996." In providing Board appeal rights to FAA employees in the new personnel system from any action that was appealable to the Board as of March 31, 1996, Congress plainly was making the Board a part of the new FAA personnel system effective April 1, 1996, and the express provision in section 307(a) that the "subsection shall take effect on April 1, 1996," makes this explicit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, section 307(a) of the Ford Act added section 40122(g)(4) to state that the amended section 40122(g) "shall take effect on April 1, 1996." Section 40122(g)(3) was revised to include Board appeal rights. Although the agency does not argue that section 40122(g)(4) applies only to some parts of the amended section 40122(g), we note that there is no indication in the statute or its legislative history that section 40122(g)(4) was meant to have such limited scope.</p>

(109 Stat.) 436, 460, effective April 1, 1996, gave the FAA the authority to set up its own personnel system, and in so doing eliminated the right of FAA employees to appeal certain actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Szajkovics v.

In all of these decisions, the Board applied the plain language of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g) as written, that is, as excluding the FAA from Title 5 coverage except where specific portions of Title 5 are made applicable to the FAA. Under the maxim of statutory construction <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>, when Congress has enumerated specific things to which a statute applies, it should not be assumed that other things that could have been listed were meant to be included; rather, the specific mention of certain things implies the exclusion of others. <span class="Italic">See Belhumeur,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Villante v.

Consistent with the approach taken in <span class="Italic">Wilke, Belhumeur, Pratt, Ivery,</span> and <span class="Italic">Wright,</span> we find that the agency was not required to follow the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) before placing the appellant on enforced leave because the FAA is not covered by chapter 75 of Title 5, U.S.C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It must be noted, however, that under the FAA's Personnel Management System, Chapter III, "Performance Management" (November 2006), it appears that FAA employees are entitled to 15 days' advance notice and an opportunity to reply to a proposed suspension.

Cir. 2009), explicitly confirmed, over the dissent of Judge Dyk, that employees who appeal adverse actions within the FAA may not secure a back pay award from the Board (although the same award could be available through other appellate or grievance procedures available to the employee) under the Department of Transportation Act of 1966:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FAA appointed Gonzalez as an air traffic controller in 1971. In February, 2005, the agency terminated Mr. Gonzalez's employment based on the belief that he was subject to mandatory separation under <span id="Page_285"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8335(a) upon reaching the age of 56. Mr. Gonzalez challenged this removal to the Board. The Board's administrative judge reversed the removal in an initial decision. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, PH-0752-05-0262-C-1 (M.S.P.B. June 30, 2005). From this date, the FAA placed Mr. Gonzalez on interim relief, returning him to duty and pay status pending adjudication of the agency's petition for review. Upon review, however, the Board reversed the initial decision and remanded the appeal to the administrative judge for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 416 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 3, 2006, the administrative judge issued an initial decision again reversing the FAA's involuntary separation of Gonzalez. The administrative judge found that Gonzalez had commenced employment as an air traffic controller before enactment of the mandatory separation provision. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, PH-0752-05-0262-C-1 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 3, 2006). The judge ordered the agency to "pay appellant by check or through electronic funds transfer for the appropriate amount of back pay" and to "inform appellant in writing of all actions taken to comply with the Board's Order and the date on which it believes it has fully complied." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8. Under this ruling, the Agency owed Mr. Gonzalez roughly five months of back pay. The FAA did not petition for review. Thus, this decision became final on September 7, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 6, 2006, the FAA informed Gonzalez that it did not intend to comply with the back pay award. Instead the Agency relied on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ivery v. Department of Transportation</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 356 (2006). In <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>, the Board held it did not have jurisdiction to order the FAA to pay back pay to employees because the FAA is not subject to the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 361. The Board had decided <span class="Italic">Ivery</span> on June 22, 2006--before the September 7, 2006 deadline for the agency to appeal the Board's August 3, 2006 decision in favor of Gonzalez.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 27, 2006, Gonzalez filed a petition to enforce the Board's August 3 decision. The Board's administrative judge found that the Board's previous remedy in favor of Mr. Gonzalez was incorrect based on <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, PH-0752-05-0262-C-1 (M.S.P.B. Mar. 29, 2007). Upon Gonzalez's petition for review of this decision, the full Board summarily affirmed. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, PH-0752-05-0262-C-1 (M.S.P.B. June 25, 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal to this court, Gonzalez challenges the underlying holding in <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>. Gonzalez also contends that the MSPB, in deciding it lacked jurisdiction to award back pay, erred by entertaining a collateral attack on the merits of its earlier final decision. This court has jurisdiction over Gonzalez's timely appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Transportation Appropriations Act of 1996 charged the FAA with creating a new personnel management system that "addresses the unique demands on the agency's workforce." Pub. L. No. 104-50, &#x00A7; 347, 109 Stat. 436, 460 (1995), as amended by Pub. L. No. 104-122, &#x00A7; 1, 110 Stat. 876, 876 (1996) ("DOT Act"). To determine the Board's jurisdiction to award back pay to FAA employees, this court must construe the statutory language of 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122, which codifies &#x00A7; 347 of the DOT Act. <span class="Italic">See Bazalo v. West</span>, 150 F.3d 1380, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 1998). This court affords those statutory terms their "ordinary, contemporary, common meaning, absent an indication Congress intended them to bear some different import." <span class="Italic">Williams v. Taylor</span>, 529 U.S. 420, 431 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the absence of ambiguity, the meaning of the statutory language governs. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. West</span>, 149 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Freytag v. Comm'r</span>, 501 U.S. 868, 873 (1991) ("When we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry should be complete except in rare and exceptional circumstances.")).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Gonzalez's claim invokes the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, which involves a waiver of the government's sovereign immunity, this court must strictly construe the relevant provisions of &#x00A7; 40122 in favor of the government. <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, and will not be implied. Moreover, a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign. To sustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims. A statute's legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text; the unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quotation marks and citations omitted). Thus, this court may only sustain Gonzalez's claim if the unambiguous text of &#x00A7; 40122 shows that the United States has waived sovereign immunity to award back pay to FAA employees like the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of &#x00A7; 40122 states: "[t]he provisions of Title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system developed and implemented" by the FAA. 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). The Back Pay Act falls in Title 5 and may only operate in favor of FAA employees if &#x00A7; 40122 grants an exception. While &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) lists eight exceptions to the FAA's exemption from Title 5, none of these exemptions includes the Back Pay Act, under which Gonzalez seeks relief. This omission is of no small consequence. "'Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.'" <span class="Italic">Espenschied v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 804 F.2d 1233, 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co.</span>, 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980)). With the additional obligation to construe this proposed waiver of sovereign immunity strictly, this court cannot create an exception that makes the Back Pay Act available to FAA employees where the language of &#x00A7; 40122 denies that remedy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gonzalez endeavors to navigate around the Title 5 exclusion by referring to some ambiguous legislative history of &#x00A7; 40122. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act of the 21st Century, Pub. L. No. 106-181, 114 Stat. 61 (2000) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3)) ("Ford Act") retroactively reinstated FAA employees' rights to appeal adverse agency personnel actions to the Board. The DOT Act had divested those rights to appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Coradeschi v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 439 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Ford Act amended the statute to add, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, subsection g(3), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under the new personnel management system developed and implemented under paragraph (1), an employee of the Administration may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board and may seek judicial review of any resulting final orders or decisions of the Board from any action that was appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation as of March 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 106-9, at 36 sec. 425 (1999) (noting the purpose of restoring "the right of FAA employees to submit appeals to the MSPB"). This language does not purport to restore any remedy under the Back Pay Act. Gonzalez, however, argues that the Ford Act's restoration of rights to appeal to the Board without the corresponding authority to award back pay would render those appeals meaningless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the contrary, this legislative history does not alter the meaning of &#x00A7; 40122. In the first place, the Supreme Court has cautioned that "[a] statute's legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text." <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192. Thus, this court may not conjecture about the reasons for the Ford Act's restoration of Board appeal rights beyond the meaning of the statutory language itself. As noted before, that language does not refer to the Back Pay Act at all, let alone expressly waive sovereign immunity for its application to FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, while the Ford Act provides FAA employees with rights to appeal to the Board, those appeals are still expressly part of and fall "[u]nder the new personnel management system developed and implemented under paragraph (1)." 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(3). The Ford Act did not alter the requirement that "[t]he provisions of title 5 shall not apply to the new personnel management system developed and implemented pursuant to paragraph (1)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2). Moreover, the Ford Act did not create an exception to this exclusion of Title 5 rights that would encompass the Back Pay Act. In sum, this court cannot infer a waiver of sovereign immunity that &#x00A7; 40122 expressly forbids. Thus, back pay awards for FAA employees must come under the "new personnel management system," not from MSPB awards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gonzalez's position is made further untenable by the back pay provision contained in the FAA's personnel management system. The FAA has provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agency funds may be used to pay back pay to an FAA employee or former employee who, <span class="Italic">as the result of a decision or settlement under the FAA Grievance Procedure, a collective bargaining agreement, FAA Appeals Procedure, or the Executive System Appeals Procedure</span> is found by an appropriate authority to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all or part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due to the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FAA Personnel Management System (PMS), Chapter II: Compensation, Section 9(a), available at <a href="https://employees.faa.gov/org/staffoffices/ahr/policy_guidance/hr_policies/pms/pmsch2/#comp9">https://employees.faa.gov/org/staffoffices/ahr/policy_guidance/hr_policies/pms/pmsch2/#comp9</a> (emphasis added). The FAA's omission of Board appeals from its list of four procedural avenues under which back pay may be awarded is glaring. Just as this court cannot read between the lines to imply an exemption for the Back Pay Act from the text of &#x00A7; 40122(g), this court must refrain from making a similar deduction regarding the agency's own regulation. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. United States</span>, 333 F.3d 1295, 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("The 'limitations and conditions upon which the Government consents to be sued must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_286"></span>Thus, the unambiguous language of &#x00A7; 40122 governs Gonzalez's claim. Under that language, Gonzalez, like all FAA employees, may not seek back pay under the Back Pay Act. To the extent that FAA employees like Gonzalez seek back pay, they must comply with the agency's own personnel management system which provides four different procedural avenues for that kind of claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court must honor, especially in the context of a waiver of sovereign immunity, the principle of <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>. Without express language in &#x00A7; 40122(g) that excludes 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, the Back Pay Act, from the general inapplicability of Title 5, the Board is correct to deny that remedy to FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court also notes that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 is listed in 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2)(H) as an exception to the bar against applying Title 5 to FAA employees. Section 1204, however, does not provide the Board authority to award back pay independent of the Back Pay Act. Section 1204(a)(2) is an "[a]ncillary" provision that endows the Board with authority to enforce its own orders in cases where it properly has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Ancillary to the board's power to adjudicate actions is the board's authority to enforce its own orders [under &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2)]."). In <span class="Italic">King</span>, this court explained that &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) provides the Board power "to enter and enforce its own orders...under the board's retained jurisdiction...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1218. This aspect of &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) is evident from its face because it grants the Board the power to "enforce compliance" with "any order or decision issued by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984), this court provided context to the scope of enforcement power granted by &#x00A7; 1204. The Board in <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> had directed the NEA to comply with an initial decision cancelling Kerr's termination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733. NEA subsequently returned Kerr to his former position at the same grade and pay, but Kerr alleged that the new position was a sham and that he had been divested of his real job. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 732. The Board held that its authority over the matter of compliance ended when Kerr was restored to his former position at the same grade and pay. This court vacated, reading &#x00A7; 1204 (originally numbered 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205) as "a broad grant of enforcement power." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733. This power included the authority to "make a substantive assessment of whether the actual duties and responsibilities to which the employee was returned are either the same as or substantially equivalent in scope and status to the duties and responsibilities held prior to the wrongful discharge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> stands for the proposition that &#x00A7; 1204 grants the Board broad authority to enforce its own remedies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pueschel v. United States</span>, 297 F.3d 1371, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing &#x00A7; 1204 and <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> for the proposition that the Board "has authority to adjudicate the merits of petitions for enforcement alleging error by an agency in awarding back pay pursuant to an MSPB order reversing a personnel action [and granting back pay]."). Notably, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span> provides no guidance as to when the Board should grant particular remedies (such as back pay) in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does <span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States</span>, 168 F.3d 24 (Fed. Cir. 1999), stand for the proposition that &#x00A7; 1204 independently grants the Board authority to award back pay. In fact, <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> does not even cite &#x00A7; 1204. Moreover, the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> argued that "[T]he Back Pay Act [not &#x00A7; 1204] entitles him to compensation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 26. Thus, <span class="Italic">Worthington</span> had no opportunity to comment on whether &#x00A7; 1204 provides an independent avenue for awarding back pay. Regardless, one issue addressed in this case was whether the Board could hear Worthington's back pay claim when it did not have jurisdiction over his underlying claim. This court answered in the negative: "the Board has jurisdiction over claims for back pay if it has (or had) jurisdiction over the underlying claim." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27. In other words, the Board can only hear back pay claims if it has jurisdiction over the underlying claim. This statement cannot fairly be read to mean that the Board has inherent jurisdiction to award back pay <span class="Italic">whenever</span> it has jurisdiction over the underlying claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Wallace v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 283 F.3d 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2002), squarely demonstrates that &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) cannot provide the Board a basis for granting back pay independent of the Back Pay Act. In <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, this court held that it could not authorize back pay interest on the petitioner's retirement benefits because "the Back Pay Act does not authorize payment of interest on back payments of retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1362. This court observed that the Board had ordered Wallace's back retirement pay restored under &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), but this court had no occasion to decide whether this underlying award had been appropriate because the only issue on appeal was whether interest on this award was forthcoming under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1364. Indeed, if &#x00A7; 1204 were a basis for back pay remedies independent of the Back Pay Act, this court could have ordered the Board to award back pay interest under &#x00A7; 1204, but it did not, mindful of this court's precedents regarding the Board's limited jurisdiction and sovereign immunity principles. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Antolin v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 895 F.2d 1395, 1396 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("The jurisdiction of the MSPB is not plenary, but is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation."); <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192 ("a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign."). In sum, without an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity to grant back pay awards, this court would not presume to venture to create new monetary rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1204 is not a fount of remedial authority that can provide the Board jurisdiction to grant back pay where it would otherwise lack it. Section 1204(a)(2) only ensures the Board that it may enforce orders for which it has statutory authority, and, in the case of monetary awards, an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity. In this instance, the Board has neither independent jurisdiction nor a waiver of sovereign immunity to grant back pay to FAA employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board's determinations about back pay awards were divorced from the Back Pay Act, cases such as <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 458 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (determining time period for which Back Pay Act permits compensation), and <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 184 F.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (analyzing Back Pay Act to determine "whether the Board must look at the cause of a disability before excluding the period of time a wrongfully terminated employee was disabled and unable to work from the back pay period"), would become dead letters. Indeed, Congress authorized the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") to "prescribe specific regulations to carry out the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 184 F.3d at 1370 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(c)). Under this authority, OPM has issued implementing regulations concerning various aspects of back pay computation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.801 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> If the Back Pay Act is not a necessary basis for the Board's award of back pay, this suggests the Board is free to disregard OPM's regulations and award back pay subject to some undefined, broad plenary power to award back pay inherent in &#x00A7; 1204. This would violate the statutory language and this court's precedent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC has asked the Board to "consider all remedies appropriate with...a finding [of discrimination] under the Rehabilitation Act, including reconsideration of back pay." <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320080101 at 7. We note first that the Board may not order the sovereign to expend funds from the public fisc without an explicit waiver of the sovereign's immunity. <span class="Italic">See Ivery,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 14. Although the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, generally provides such a waiver, 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2), which established the FAA's personnel management system, has the effect of making certain provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code--including the Back Pay Act--inapplicable to FAA employees. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation,</span> 551 F.3d 1372, 137677 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Bennett v.

Although the Board has noted the possibility that it may have been an oversight by Congress to restore Board appeal rights to FAA employees without also restoring the right of a successful Board appellant to be awarded back pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, <span class="Italic">see Ivery,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 14, the doctrine of sovereign immunity will not allow the Board to assume such authority in the absence of the required explicit waiver of that immunity. Accordingly, as the Board noted in its August 6, 2008 Opinion and Order, the appellant, as an FAA employee, is not eligible for back pay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Edwards,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 23 n.6; <span class="Italic">see also Gonzalez,</span> 551 F.3d at 1376-77; <span class="Italic">Ivery,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note, however, that the Rehabilitation Act provides that the remedies set forth in Section 717 of Title VII, including the remedies provided in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(f) through (k), shall be available to any employee aggrieved under the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794a(a)(1). Title 42 of the U.S. Code, section 2000e-5(g)(1) provides that if an agency has intentionally engaged in an unlawful employment practice, affirmative action, which may include back pay, may be ordered. An agency's back pay liability under this section is limited to a period of 2 years prior to the filing of a charge with the EEOC, and may be reduced by interim earnings or "amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person...discriminated against...." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not typically award back pay under the Rehabilitation <span id="Page_287"></span>Act; rather, it typically relies on the Back Pay Act as the appropriate authority under which to award back pay because it is a more specific statute that applies to cases arising in the federal employment context and because it is often the more generous of the two statutes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schultz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 8 &#x0026; n.5 (2001). In relying on the Back Pay Act to award back pay, however, the Board has never suggested that it is without the authority to award back pay under the Rehabilitation Act where awarding such pay under the Back Pay Act would be inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., PFR 7-8; <span class="Italic">see also Caronia v. Department of Justice,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 201, 214-15 (1998) (considering whether, under the circumstances, the appellant was entitled to a remedy under the Rehabilitation Act), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Carter v. Department of Justice,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 641, &#x00B6; 25 n.5 (2001). In the present case, back pay may not be awarded under the Back Pay Act. Accordingly, and in light of the agency's discrimination on the basis of the appellant's disability in effecting her removal, we find that the appellant is entitled to back pay pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant may also be entitled to compensatory damages. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA), 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a, compensatory damages were not available in Board appeals. <span class="Italic">See Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 195 (1996). The CRA provides that in an action brought under the Rehabilitation Act against an agency who engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination, the complaining party may recover compensatory damages in addition to any relief authorized under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g). 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2). Compensatory damages awarded under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(2) do not include back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of relief authorized under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-5(g). <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(2). Compensatory damages contemplated by &#x00A7; 1981a include "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses...." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3).</p>
