<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-273"><span class="space">e.</span> Government Services or Funds</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Discipline was sustained for intentional misuse of government manpower through direction of a work crew to perform work on a private project with government tools and materials. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 105, 109-10 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ford v. DOD</span>, 30 MSPR 43, 44-45 (1986) (suspension of one employee, removal of another, for the unauthorized use of government facilities to conduct personal business while on duty). A penalty of not more than a 30-day suspension, rather than removal, was appropriate for minor offenses characterized as theft or unauthorized use of government services, including the failure to pay a $12 locker fee, use of government employees during their lunch break to assist in changing a tire on the appellant's car, and use of a government employee to assist the appellant in doing personal shopping at the base commissary for one or two hours, coupled with two incidents of unauthorized absence from duty totaling seven hours. <span class="Italic">Spisak v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3127). <span class="Italic">Satornino v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3471), noted the dismissal of an employee who received repeated unauthorized treatments from the agency and who was also charged with willful falsification of official government records to qualify for that treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holt v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 198, 201-04 (1994), explained the demotion of a postmaster charged with abusing his authority by using employees to do personal work for him:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the administrative judge did not appreciate the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct. As the Postmaster, the appellant was in charge of the entire facility. He has been found guilty of using Postal Service personnel to perform personal services for him on official time. Thus, he misused his authority as Postmaster for personal gain. This abuse of his position goes to the very heart of his employment relationship with the agency and effectively destroys the trust that the agency must have in every Postmaster. Because the appellant was a supervisory employee, particularly one who occupied a position of great trust, the agency was entitled to hold the appellant to a higher standard of conduct than nonsupervisory employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Walcott v. US Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 277, 284, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is true even though the agency reassigned the appellant to another supervisory position. The difference between a Postmaster's supervisory responsibilities and the trust and confidence necessarily placed in <span id="Page_2804"></span>the occupant of such a position are vastly different than for an EAS-15 Supervisor position in the Postal Service. As the agency notes on review, as an EAS-15 Supervisor, the appellant would be subjected to direct, on-site supervision. His responsibilities and the independent exercise of his judgment and discretion, while still considerable, would be severely limited as compared to that granted a Postmaster.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also gave insufficient weight to documentary evidence and the testimony of the deciding official showing that the agency has imposed similar demotion penalties in two other cases in which the sole charge was using subordinates to perform personal services. Given that the administrative judge did not sustain two of the agency's charges, it is particularly relevant to look at the penalty imposed in this case with those imposed by the same deciding official for similar offenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we note that the deciding official testified that, in two prior instances in which he was also the deciding official, he demoted two supervisory employees...for using postal resources for their personal benefit....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 105, 108-10, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 862 F.2d 321 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table), the Board sustained the removal of an Electrician Foreman who intentionally misused government resources, materials, and manpower by directing subordinate employees to work on a private project while on duty. In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 223, 226-29 (1987), the Board affirmed the administrative judge's decision to mitigate the appellant's removal from his GS-9 Supply Officer position to a demotion to a GS-7 position and a 60-day suspension based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a charge of using Federal employees for other than official purposes while the employees were in a duty status. In <span class="Italic">Super v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 24 MSPR 221, 222-23 (1984), the appeal of an Aircraft Maintenance Manager who was removed based on, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a charge of misuse of assigned personnel, the Board mitigated the removal penalty to a demotion to a nonsupervisory position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of these three cases involved additional sustained charges beyond the sustained charges at issue in this appeal. In addition, each of these three cases involved widely varying aggravating and mitigating factors. Nonetheless, they stand for the proposition that this type of misconduct, using subordinate employees to perform personal tasks while on official duty, is quite serious and warrants significant disciplinary action. In <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 33 MSPR at 229, the Board held that, while the appellant may have had the confidence of his immediate supervisors, his ability to require his subordinates to adhere strictly to agency policy was undermined by his failure to adhere strictly to agency policy. Similarly here, the appellant's ability as a Postmaster to require his subordinates to adhere strictly to agency policy, especially in the areas of time and attendance and conducting personal business on official time, has been seriously undermined by his use of a subordinate employee to conduct personal business on agency time and, to a lesser extent, by his failure to follow agency procedures as to the refund of postage and fees to the bank.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In mitigating the penalty, the administrative judge partially relied on the fact that the appellant committed only a single offense of using subordinate employees to perform personal services while on duty. However, she found that the appellant ordered J.R. Dyer, a subordinate employee who performed personal services for him, to perform additional personal services for Elizabeth Kelley, Superintendent of Postal Operations. The appellant was not charged for this conduct. However, it shows that the appellant was likely prone to compromise the trust that resided in him as a Postmaster.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that it was highly unlikely that the appellant would ever engage in similar misconduct and that he was therefore an excellent candidate for rehabilitation. She did not explain her finding, however, nor did she cite any evidence of the appellant's remorse. As we state above, the appellant was prone to violate the agency's trust in him. Contrary to the administrative judge's unsupported determinations in this regard, we find that the appellant is a poor candidate for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee may be disciplined for improper use of government funds, even if the employee does not benefit from the expenditure. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 500, 505 (1995), sustained a charge of misappropriation of funds for a purpose prohibited by agency regulations (use of about $1,800 in appropriated funds to purchase gifts for military members, employees, or private citizens other than as specifically authorized by law), with an explanation of what constitutes appropriated funds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The government's budget authority consists of three specific forms: appropriations, borrowing authority, and contract authority. <span class="Italic">See Instructions of Budget Execution,</span> Office of Management and Budget, Circular No. A-34, Ch. 21.1, November 1994 (<span class="Italic">Instructions</span>). The "appropriations" form of authority is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appropriations</span>...are authority to incur obligations and make expenditures, including the authority to obligate and expend offsetting receipts and collections (other than borrowing authority), that is provided in appropriations acts and other provisions of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at II-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appropriations do not represent cash actually set aside in the Treasury for purposes specified in the appropriation act; rather, they represent amounts that agencies may obligate during the period of time specified in the respective appropriation acts. <span class="Italic">See A Glossary of Terms Used in the Federal Budget Process,</span> General Accounting Office, (Revised January 1993) at 21. Governmental monetary collections are classified into two major categories, governmental receipts and offsetting collections. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 27. While "governmental receipts" are collections from the public based on the government's exercise of its sovereign powers, such as taxes, fines, and the like, "offsetting collections" consist of "collections from the public that are of a business-type or market-oriented nature," including "collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 27-28. Such "offsetting receipts cannot be used without being appropriated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government's budget totals are comprised of two major fund groups, Federal and trust. <span class="Italic">Instructions</span>, at II-3. The "Federal funds" group comprises "all of the expenditure, receipt, and fund accounts that are not designated by law as trust funds," and includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Intragovernmental revolving fund accounts</span>...[which] record the permanent appropriations and expenditures of collections, primarily from other agencies and accounts, that are earmarked to finance a continuing cycle of business-type operations, e.g., working capital funds, <span class="Italic">industrial funds</span>, stock funds and supply funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Instructions</span> at II-3, (underlining supplied). Therefore, we find that the "industrial fund" at issue in this appeal is "appropriated" within the meaning of AFR-172-1.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the charge was that the appellant misused funds to purchase briefcases for various personnel. Sustaining the adverse action, the Board observed, 67 MSPR at 509:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant's flaunting of agency rules and regulations, both in misappropriating agency funds and in misusing government property, if not checked, would eventually result in disrespect and the undermining of agency goals and objectives, not to mention depletion and waste of the agency's resources. The agency cannot countenance individuals who ignore its mission in order to run their own programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is no evidence of potential rehabilitation in this case. To the contrary, the appellant's petition for review is a continuation of his attempts to rationalize his actions, without acknowledging that they were inappropriate. Indeed, as we have stated, the appellant had been warned 3 years earlier that such actions were inappropriate and impermissible<span class="Italic">. See Perrodin v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 407, 413 (1992) (in assessing the appropriateness of the agency's penalty, the Board may consider the clarity with which an employee was on notice of rules which were violated in committing the offense).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lewin v. DOJ</span>, 74 MSPR 294, 300 (1997), sustained the 30-day suspension of a law enforcement officer who repeatedly diverted officially acquired frequent flyer mileage for trips valued at over $31,000 for himself and his family.
