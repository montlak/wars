<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-61"><span class="space">1.</span> Other Than a Temporary Appointment Limited to One Year or Less</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7511 an "employee" is the individual in the competitive service who has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. [For discussion of the nature of temporary appointments, with reference to OPM regulations, refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-058.html#sec1-59">Time in Nonpermanent Appointment as a Component of Current Continuous Service</a>" and <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/13-3056.Opinion.1-13-2014.1.PDF">741 F.3d 81</a> (Fed. Cir. 2014) (Judge Prost dissenting).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JOHNSON_CHERISE_C_PH_0752_04_0193_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250342.pdf">99 MSPR 362</a>, 364-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-10 (2005), explained that temporary appointments do not carry ordinary Board appeal rights unless the appointments exceed a year and the employee's current continuous service lasts at least a year:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who is separated involuntarily for cause is entitled to appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1) &#x0026; 7513(d), as long as he or she meets the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). That definition provides, in pertinent part, that "employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an individual in the competitive service--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied,</span> 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court ruled that an individual who did not meet the definition of "employee" under subsection (A)(i) because she was serving a probationary period when she was removed nevertheless had appeal rights because she satisfied the definition of "employee" under subsection (A)(ii). The <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> decision emphasizes that subsections (A)(i) and (A)(ii) are separated by the word "or," and states that those subsections should be read as providing "alternative definitions" of "employee." 307 F.3d at 1342. The <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> decision could therefore be read to hold broadly that anyone who meets the literal terms of either subsection (A)(i) or subsection (A)(ii) has adverse action appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The specific issue before the court in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, though, was whether a probationer who met the literal terms of subsection (A)(ii) has appeal rights. The facts of this appeal are the converse of <span class="Italic">McCormick.</span> At the time of her separation, the appellant herein did not have the requisite length of service to satisfy subsection (A)(ii), but she met the literal definition of "employee" in subsection (A)(i) because she was "an individual in the competitive service" "who [wa]s not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment." For the reasons given below, we conclude that <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> should not be read broadly to apply to facts that were not before the court in that case. Accordingly, we hold that a temporary appointee who lacks the requisite length of service to satisfy subsection (A)(ii) does not have adverse action appeal rights merely because he or she meets the literal terms of subsection (A)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that a temporary appointee is an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) <span class="Italic">only</span> if at the time of the action he or she had one year of current continuous service under other than an appointment limited to one year or less. <span class="Italic">Bodus v.

Cir. 1987). In deciding the present case the Board is entitled to rely on its consistent, longstanding interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(A) as it applies to temporary appointees, an interpretation which has never been questioned by the court. Thus, <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 551, 556 (1997) remains good law insofar as it held that the appeal rights of an individual serving under an appointment that does not require completion of a probationary or trial period are governed exclusively by subsection (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(A) is consistent with <span class="Italic">Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 47 F.3d 409 (Fed. Cir. 1995). There, a non-preference eligible in the excepted service argued that he was an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because he fell within that subsection's literal terms.[3] The court disagreed, reasoning that because the appellant did not have the kind of appointment described in section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), he would be considered to have appeal rights only if he had the two years of current continuous service required to satisfy the alternative definition of "employee" at section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). 47 F.3d at 412. Since the appellant lacked the requisite length of service, the court concluded that he did not have appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court noted that the appellant did not point to anything in the legislative history of section 7511(a)(1)(C) to suggest that Congress intended a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The statutory provisions construed in <span class="Italic">Forest</span> provide that a non-preference eligible in the excepted service is an "employee" with appeal rights if he is an individual--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or (ii) who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). Mr. Forest was a non-preference eligible in the excepted service, and was "not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service" when he was separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Forest</span>,[4] the appellant does not have the type of appointment referred to in section 7511(a)(1)(A)(i), since as a temporary appointee she was not required to serve "a probationary or trial period." Thus, just as in <span class="Italic">Forest</span>, the appellant must have the requisite current continuous service (one year) specified in the definition of "employee" at subsection (A)(ii). Lacking that, the appellant has no appeal rights. The appellant does not point to anything in the legislative history of section 7511(a)(1)(A) to suggest that Congress intended a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Subsections (A) and (C) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) are similar in structure and wording, so an existing interpretation of subsection (C) may serve as guidance in interpreting subsection (A). <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion is also consistent with <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed.

To conclude in this case that the appellant has appeal rights under subsection (A)(i) because she was "not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment" when she was separated would produce an unreasonable result. Interpreting the statute in this way would mean that every temporary appointee would have tenure, <span class="Italic">i.e</span>., the right to be removed only for cause and a corresponding right of appeal, on his or her very first day of work. We have no reason to believe that such a construction of the law was intended either by Congress or the <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> court.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the intervening temporary appointment means that the appellant did not have one year of current continuous service in other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less because, by statute, service in temporary appointments limited to one year or less does not count towards completion of the one-year current continuous service requirement of section 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Vaught v.

While the Board is empowered by statute to hear appeals of removals from the federal service, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d), 7701(a), the right to appeal an action to the Board is generally limited to persons who meet the definition of "employee" set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). Under the provision relevant here, the term "employee" means:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">i) who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment; or</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed.

However, since <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Board has specifically considered the question of whether an employee serving in a temporary position limited to 1 year or less can qualify as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See Tschumy v.

The Board found that, although the court's decision in <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> could be read to hold broadly that anyone who meets the literal terms of either subsection (A)(i) or subsection (A)(ii) has adverse action appeal rights, the Board would not apply such a broad holding where temporary employees are involved. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8. The Board found that, to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> broadly in such cases would produce an unreasonable result, i.e., every temporary appointee would have appeal rights from the appointee's very first day of work--a result that it had no reason to believe Congress intended. <span class="Italic">Tschumy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 488, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10.

Therefore, a temporary appointee is an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) <span class="Italic">only</span> if at the time of the action he or she had 1 year of current continuous service under an appointment other than one limited to 1 year or less. <span class="Italic">Tschumy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 488, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that, at the time the agency terminated the appellant's employment due to lack of funds, the appellant was employed in the competitive service under a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. <span class="Italic">Dooley</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA-1221-97-0394-W-1. It is also undisputed that the appellant's service from February 1991 to March 1992 was performed under multiple temporary appointments limited to less than 1 year. Because the appellant was a temporary appointee whose service, although greater than 1 year, was under temporary appointments limited to 1 year or less, he was not an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horner v. Lucas</span>, 832 F.2d 596, 596-97 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1987), assessed the effect of prior service in a competitive service position on the tenure of an individual currently serving in a temporary appointment of less than a year:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent Lucas was a painter's helper at the Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville, Kentucky (agency), serving from August 19, 1984 to August 17, 1985 in a temporary position. While in that temporary position, he had an altercation (on March 15, 1985) with another painter's helper while on duty. Considering Lucas a temporary worker not entitled to the protections of an "employee" under the Civil Service Reform Act (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)), his agency removed him (on April 5, 1985) without granting him all the procedural protections of such a statutory "employee"....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the arbitrator erroneously interpreted the statute. Section 7511(a)(1)(A) of title 5 provides that an "employee" (for purposes of the adverse action portion of the Civil Service Reform Act) is described as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment or who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time Mr. Lucas was removed, he held only a temporary appointment.... Nor had he, at that time, served in a non-temporary appointment for which he had completed current continuous employment of at least one year. To be an "employee" the statute mandates that he be serving in continuous employment in a non-temporary appointment <span class="Italic">at the time of the adverse action</span>. Previous service in a non-temporary post, which is followed by new temporary positions, is irrelevant under the statute.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Petitioner's service as a career-conditional employee between 1981-1984 was both preceded and followed by new periods of temporary employment. There was no continuity between the career-conditional service and the subsequent temporary service, including the temporary post from which he was removed in 1985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also confirming this reading are the legislative and administrative constructions. The Senate Report for the Civil Service Reform Act said that the part of the bill which became subsection 7511(a) "provides a statutory basis for the procedural protections and appeal rights now granted employees in the competitive service who are serving under career, career-conditional, or certain other non-temporary appointments" (emphasis added). S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2770. Also, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) chapter 752 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees in temporary appointments limited to one year or less are not covered by the provisions of adverse action law and regulation even when their appointments may inadvertently be extended past one year or when they have served more than a year in two or more temporary appointments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The tenure of an employee serving under a temporary appointment is not augmented to a year of current continuous employment under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A) if the agency places the employee in a leave without pay status for two pay periods because of administrative delay in processing the termination of the appointment. <span class="Italic">Marshall v.
