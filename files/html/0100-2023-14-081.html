<p class="Body-Text">In 2022, the Federal Circuit and the Board (having just reestablished its quorum after a lapse of five years) began redefining the scope of comparator analysis. There had been an earlier effort through Executive Order to narrow the scope of comparators. Executive Order 13,839 of May 25, 2018, issued by President Trump ("Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles"), at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, attempted to direct agencies to consider but not be strictly bound by a comparator analysis. Under the (now-revoked) 2018 Order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2. Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time--particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision--and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2020 OPM regulation, following up on portions of the Executive Order, is earlier noted in this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">President Trump's Executive Order was revoked by President Biden's Executive Order 14,003 (January 22, 2021), <span class="Italic">Protecting the Federal Workforce</span>, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/27/2021-01924/protecting-the-federal-workforce</a>. [Refer to March 5, 2021, OPM <span class="Italic">Guidance for Implementation of Executive Order 14003-Protecting the Federal Workforce</span>, <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protecting-federal-workforce">https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-implementation-executive-order-14003-protecting-federal-workforce</a> as to continuing validity of regulations issued by OPM under the 2018 Executive Orders.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to law made by adjudicators' decisions, earlier discussion reviewed <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), determining that "the fact that two employees come from different work units and/or supervisory chains remains an important factor in determining whether it is appropriate to compare the penalties they are given.... [i]n most cases, employees from another work unit or supervisory chain will not be proper comparators"). [Refer to "Disparate; Comparable Penalties" for discussion of <span class="Italic">Singh</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Traditionally, and until its decisions in <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. DHS</span>, 114 MSPR 100, 2010 MSPB 85 (2010) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), except to the extent the decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009)), and <span class="Italic">Lewis v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 657, 2010 MSPB 98 (2010) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), except to the extent the decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and <span class="Italic">Facer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 836 F2d 535 (Fed. Cir. 1988)), <span class="Italic">post,</span> the Board often narrowed the disparity analysis by narrowing the relevant work force to the group of employees working for the appellant's supervisor. There were exceptions involving broader comparisons. Decisions starting in 2010 broaden or clarify the prior analysis from the level of the first level supervisor or work unit to the work unit encompassed at the decisionmaker's level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2020, OPM issued a regulation (since dropped) seeking to narrow the comparator analysis, 5 CFR 752.202 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Employees should be treated equitably. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time. An agency should consider appropriate comparators as the agency evaluates a potential disciplinary action. Appropriate comparators to be considered are primarily individuals in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, who engaged in the same or similar misconduct. Proposing and deciding officials are not bound by previous decisions in earlier similar cases, but should, as they deem appropriate, consider such decisions consonant with their own managerial authority and responsibilities and independent judgment. For example, a supervisor is not bound by his or her predecessor whenever there is similar conduct. A minor indiscretion for one supervisor based on a particular set of facts can amount to a more serious offense under a different supervisor. Nevertheless, they should be able to articulate why a more or less severe penalty is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2022, OPM revised its regulations to delete subsection (d). 87 Fed. Reg. 67765 (Nov. 10, 2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law decided before 2010, to establish disparate treatment, "an appellant must first demonstrate that differing penalties were meted out for similar offenses occurring in his own unit"; "[h]owever, a comparison to employees in other work units may buttress a finding of disparate treatment if it is first evidenced in an appellant's own unit." <span class="Italic">Catau v. DHHS</span>, 13 MSPR 230, 232 (1982). In <span class="Italic">Gooch v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 90, 92 (1986), appellant was removed for striking her supervisor. Her defense included evidence that other employees engaging in physical assaults received penalties less severe than removal. The Board dismissed the disparity defense: "the agency alleged that the comparison employees were not in appellant's work unit and did not work under the appellant's supervisor...." <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 343, 354 (1991) (reviewing similar offenses by another employee in the appellant's work unit; noting that the agency had the burden to demonstrate significant differences in mitigating circumstances, but noting that the consistency of a penalty is only one factor to consider relative to mitigation); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 501, 506 (1991) (discounting a disparity argument when the appellant and a comparison employee were in different departments, with different deciding officials); <span class="Italic">Combs v.

VA</span>, 21 MSPR 1, 3 (1984) (AJ properly precluded an appellant seeking to show union animus through disparate treatment from introducing evidence of work practices in areas of the hospital other than the appellant's department). The Board reiterated in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 438, 444 (1987), that "employees identified to establish a claim of disparate treatment must be in the same organizational unit." <span class="Italic">See Gaskins v.

<p class="Body-Text">To narrow the scope of the disparate penalty analysis even further, the Board appeared to suggest in <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 54 MSPR 619, 629 (1992), that the focal point of examination is at the level of the proposing official rather than that of the relatively elevated deciding official who would usually have responsibility for a larger group of potential comparators:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge nevertheless found that all of the twelve comparison employees were similarly situated to the appellant...because the deciding official, Mr. Shaddick, in his capacity as the official overseeing the operation of the agency's field offices was, in essence, the "reviewing official" for all of the cases. This was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that virtually every agency with regional or field offices will have an official whose position requires that he or she oversee their operations. That is not to say, however, that all regional and field employees presumably work under the direct supervision of that official, and so, can be considered comparison employees for purposes of analyzing a disparate treatment claim. Such a broad holding would effectively negate the well-established rule that employees in different work units and who work for different supervisors are not similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Canevari</span>, 50 MSPR at 318; <span class="Italic">Gooch</span>, 30 MSPR at 92-93.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 99 MSPR 604, 607 &#x00B6; 7 (2005) ("To be similarly situated, employees must have the same supervisor."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 484, 490-93 (1994) (a comparator did not work in the same organizational level for the same supervisor).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One Federal Circuit case seemed to ignore the Board's effort to narrow the scope of comparable offenses to a universe limited by the boundaries of a particular work unit. In <span class="Italic">Sekerak v. R.R. Retirement Bd.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3061), involving charges of misuse of a government vehicle, the court remanded the removal case back to the Board for consideration of a suspension. The court observed that other cases involving other agencies imposed suspensions for vehicle misuse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009), questioned, but did not decide, whether a disparity analysis is confined to employees within a single chain of command. The case involved two individuals in an SSA organization who were involved in a scheme to prepare fraudulent tax returns. One employee, Appellant Williams, was fired, and another employee, Edwards, was fired but there was a question of whether Edwards was reemployed. The court returned the appeal to the Board with the observation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2386"></span>The fact that the supervisor who gave this testimony did not directly supervise Edwards does not justify treating his testimony as irrelevant. While the fact that two employees are supervised under different chains of command may sometimes justify different penalties, in this case the administrative judge has not explained, and the record does not reveal, why the different chains of command would justify the agency treating Edwards, the perpetrator of the tax fraud, more favorably than Williams, who merely had participated in it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The comment in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> was taken to heart by the Board in <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. DHS</span>, 114 MSPR 100, 108-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22, 2010 MSPB 85 (2010) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), except to the extent the decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009)), involving a federal air marshal in one geographical area whose discipline was apparently harsher than what was received by air marshals who committed similar offenses in another geographical area. <span class="Italic">Woebcke,</span> sustaining the AJ's penalty mitigation, said that the agency must justify the apparent disparity despite distinctions in chains of command:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition, the agency contends further that the administrative judge improperly compared the appellant's discipline with invalid comparators in the New York Field Office and ignored evidence that two FAMs in the New York Field Office who committed similar misconduct were terminated. The agency's file contains sanitized copies of the decisions removing two FAMs for solicitation of prostitution in about February and March 2008 while on an international mission. However, the appellant raised an allegation that the agency treated him disparately by submitting sanitized copies of 6 decisions giving 14-day suspensions to FAMs who were charged with conduct unbecoming for solicitation of a prostitute in about February 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately as compared to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Vargas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). As noted above, the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses is only one of the factors to be considered under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> in determining the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Defense,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 546, 552, <span class="Italic">affd,</span> 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983). Where an employee raises an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8 (2009); <span class="Italic">Woody v. General Services Administration,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 486, 488 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge carefully considered the consistency of the penalty imposed on the appellant with the penalties imposed upon other employees for the same or a similar offense. The administrative judge found that the appellant learned through discovery that about 9 or 10 months after the appellant's misconduct, and before the agency selected the penalty for the appellant, a number of FAMs had traveled to Germany, gotten drunk and solicited prostitutes. She found the FAMs who had solicited prostitutes in Germany, who were not team leaders, had received 14-day suspensions for their misconduct based on the charges of conduct unbecoming and not being prepared for duty, which are similar to the charges of conduct unbecoming and a missed mission that the appellant received. The administrative judge noted that the agency only removed the team leader involved in the incident in Germany and removed him based on charges in addition to conduct unbecoming and not being prepared for duty. The administrative judge distinguished that case with her finding that the record established that the FAM who was removed was a team leader who had additional charges brought against him. She found the appellant was not a team leader on his assignment to Hawaii.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, the appellant has raised an allegation of disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees and the agency has failed to prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Lewis,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8. Further, the administrative judge's consideration of the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees from another office is consistent with the recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration,</span> 586 F. 3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009). In that decision, the court held that, although the fact that two employees are supervised by different individuals may sometimes justify different penalties, an agency must explain why differing chains of command would justify different penalties. <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 586 F.3d at 1368. The court's finding specifically criticized the finding by the administrative judge deciding Williams's appeal that treating employees disparately is not relevant when the employees are in different chains of command. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the administrative judge here properly considered disparate penalties in comparison to specified employees and correctly substituted a 14-day suspension for the removal penalty. Where, as here, the administrative judge has made credibility determinations based on the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), and the Board discerns no sufficiently sound reason to overturn these determinations under <span class="Italic">Haebe,</span> we will not second guess the administrative judge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next considered is <span class="Italic">Boucher v.</span> <span class="Italic"> USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 640, 647-651, 657-62 &#x00B6; 20-29, 2012 MSPB 126 (2012) (dissent by Member Robbins reprinted below) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), to the extent that the disparate penalty analysis should extend beyond the same or similar offenses). Reduced to the essentials, the appellant, a mail handler in Huntsville, was on lunch break when she was arrested, then convicted, and removed by the plant manager, Mr. Hyde, for unlawful possession of a controlled substance. On appeal the appellant argued that the penalty was unreasonable because an agency employee was indicted a few years earlier for bringing contraband into a correctional facility while off duty, leading to a settlement through the agency plant manager, Mr. Miller, of the employee's grievance of the ensuing indefinite suspension by a return to work with back pay. It was the agency's contention that the appellant's conduct differed from the comparator because it occurred at least in part on agency property and it resulted in publicity. The administrative judge mitigated the penalty to a 90-day suspension, and on appeal the Board affirmed the mitigation through a comparability analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is "enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors." <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15 (2010).[4] If she does so, the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We overrule Board cases such as <span class="Italic">Reeves v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 201 (2011) and <span class="Italic">Bencomo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 621 (2011) to the extent that they cite <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> for the proposition that "there must be a <span class="Italic">great deal</span> of similarity, not only between the offenses committed and the proposed comparator, but as to other factors, such as whether the employees worked in the same unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time." (emphasis added). This quotation from <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> appears in the context of the Board's discussion of its framework for analyzing disparate penalty claims as it existed prior to our reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the behavior of Mr. McCainey and the appellant are not substantially similar for several reasons. First, the appellant and Mr. McCainey were charged with possession of different controlled substances, as the appellant was charged with possession of both cocaine and marijuana, whereas Mr. McCainey's misconduct involved only marijuana. Second, the appellant's misconduct occurred while she was still on duty, her arrest took place near agency property, and she possessed illegal drugs while on government property. Mr. McCainey's misconduct and arrest took place while he was off duty and did not occur near the worksite. Third, the appellant's misconduct was publicized, as her arrest was reported on television and in the newspaper. Mr. McCainey's arrest did not garner any publicity. Fourth, the appellant's misconduct took place more than three years after Mr. McCainey's and her conviction occurred more than five years after Mr. McCainey's guilty plea. Fifth, Mr. Hyde was the deciding official in the appellant's removal whereas Mr. Miller decided to bring Mr. McCainey back to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant and Mr. McCainey had different first-line supervisors, they worked under the same plant manager at the time of their offenses and worked at the same post office. While the fact that two employees are supervised by different individuals may sometimes justify different penalties, an agency must explain why differing chains of command would justify different penalties. In this case, the agency has not shown why the different chains of command would justify no penalty for Mr. McCainey, but removal for the appellant. Further, both individuals were charged with comparable offenses. Although the appellant was charged with possession of a more serious drug than Mr. McCainey, his offense was a more serious act, in that he attempted to smuggle marijuana into a prison facility. Although there were several years between the offenses committed by Mr. McCainey and the appellant and there were variances regarding publicity and the type of drug involved, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency has failed to explain, by preponderant evidence, why Mr. McCainey received no discipline, but the appropriate penalty for the appellant was removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2387"></span>In his dissent, the Member states that he would find that the appellant failed to show that the charges and circumstances surrounding her charged behavior are substantially similar to those of Mr. McCainey, and he also questions developments in Board case law on disparate penalties in cases such as <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). As the Member recognizes, the impetus for the Board's approach in these cases was our reviewing courts' decision in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the court rejected an administrative judge's determination that a comparator employee was not similarly situated to the appellant for purposes of a disparate penalties claim simply because the employees were supervised under different chains of command. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368. The court stated that, although a difference in supervisors may sometimes justify different penalties, the administrative judge did not explain, and the record did not reveal, <span class="Italic">why</span> the difference would justify the difference in penalties in that case. 586 F.3d at 1368-69. The court remanded the appeal with instructions to the Board "to develop, as fully as possible," the facts relating to the agency's actions concerning the comparator employee; make findings and conclusions about those issues; and based on that augmented record and those findings and conclusions, reconsider the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Lewis, Woebcke</span> and <span class="Italic">Villada</span> follows from, and is entirely consistent with, the court's direction to the Board in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> to analyze disparate penalty claims on the basis of a fully-developed record. As stated above, under that framework, the agency's burden to prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment between employees is triggered by the appellant's initial showing that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15. The appellant clearly made that initial showing here. Nonetheless, as stated above, the agency has consistently maintained that the circumstances surrounding their charged behavior were not substantially similar, and it has failed to offer any persuasive explanation of <span class="Italic">why</span> Mr. McCainey's conduct did not warrant any discipline at all, whereas the appellant's misconduct warranted removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The approach the Member advocates in his dissent will not, in our opinion, promote full development of the record on disparate penalty claims, and in fact would discourage it. Indeed, the Member's approach would reward agencies for ignoring this <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor altogether. For example, the Member notes that the agency placed McCainey on emergency suspension but reinstated him with back pay for the period of the suspension pursuant to the terms of a grievance settlement. He concludes that because it is "not clear" whether the deciding official knew about the McCainey settlement or what the terms of that settlement were, this alone justifies a difference in treatment, as long as the penalty in this case is otherwise reasonable under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Member also argues that it is inappropriate to ask the agency to explain why it treated McCainey the way it did, because evidence that the agency settled some other case is inadmissible for purposes of assessing the reasonableness of the penalty in this one. Because the agency did not make this contention in the context of this appeal and the appellant has not had the opportunity to address it, we decline to consider it <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> for the first time on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Certainly, whether a deciding official knowingly treated similarly-situated employees differently is a relevant consideration in determining whether a penalty is reasonable, but it is not the only relevant consideration. Further, whether this consideration justifies a difference in penalties depends upon the facts and circumstances, which can only be discerned on the basis of a fully-developed evidentiary record. An agency cannot, however, justify its penalty determination by leaving the record unclear on the question whether the deciding official knew if that penalty was consistent with those imposed on employees for the same or similar offenses. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 586 F.3d at 1368 (under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, agencies are <span class="Italic">required</span> to consider, in determining an appropriate penalty for employee misconduct, the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses). Indeed, a deciding official's failure to consider this <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor could result in the agency's penalty determination being entitled to no deference at all. <span class="Italic">See Bivens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 458, 461 (1981) (an agency's determination of an appropriate penalty is not entitled to deference when the deciding official does not consider any of the relevant mitigating circumstances). Here, as the Member acknowledges, it is not clear whether the deciding official knew about McCainey, the settlement of his grievance, or what the terms of that settlement were. Further, it is by no means certain that the agency would be required under the Member's approach to present any evidence to clarify these issues. That is, because the Member does not believe the appellant met her burden of showing that she and Mr. McCainey are similarly situated, he implicitly concludes that the agency's burden to prove--or even articulate--a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment was never "triggered."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Member also states in his dissent that the <span class="Italic">Villada-Woebcke-Lewis</span> trilogy attempts to promote a universal consistency in penalty setting, whereas, in his view, the Civil Service Reform Act's scheme for employee discipline should tolerate localized or organizational differences, so long as the penalty in any particular case is reasonable and consistent with <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. The Member also expresses his concern that the foregoing cases might force an agency to "go easy" on an employee who committed serious misconduct because of the unwarranted leniency of some other manager in the past. We disagree with the Member's characterization of the Board's holdings in these cases. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Villada, Woebcke</span> or <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> forecloses an agency from proffering evidence that a difference in treatment of employees was attributable to local or organizational differences, or that a penalty for a certain offence was too lenient in the past. In this regard, we note that <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> recognizes as a relevant consideration "whether the agency began levying a more severe penalty for a certain offense without giving notice of a change in policy." 115 M.S.P.R. &#x00B6; 15, n.4. Because nothing in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> bars an agency from providing its employees with notice of a change in policy imposing a more severe penalty for a certain offense, nothing in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> forces an agency to go easy on employees who commit that offense in the future.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, none of the foregoing concerns are implicated by the facts of this case. The agency makes no attempt here to attribute Mr. McCainey's lack of discipline to unwarranted leniency or to organizational differences. Although the Board may be presented with a future case in which an agency does so, we cannot base our decision on evidence that the agency failed to present or on an argument that it did not make.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find no reason to disturb the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency has not justified a removal for the appellant in light of the lack of penalty for Mr. McCainey, and that a 90-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty under the circumstances of this case....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISSENTING OPINION OF MEMBER MARK A. ROBBINS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the law of the case doctrine does not preclude reexamination of the reasonableness of the penalty, I believe the administrative judge erred in mitigating the appellant's removal to a 90-day suspension. Where, as here, all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board will review the agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Singletary v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553, &#x00B6; 9 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 155 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). In making this determination, the Board must give due weight to the agency's primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency, recognizing that the Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility, but to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised. <span class="Italic">Singletary</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. The Board will modify or mitigate an agency-imposed penalty only where it finds the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the penalty clearly exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Singletary</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 553, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The February 18, 2010 decision letter and the testimony of the deciding official in the appellant's removal, Plant Manager Roger Hyde, as summarized in both the initial decision and the remand initial decision, show that the deciding official properly considered the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in imposing a penalty of removal. Mr. Hyde testified that due to the notoriety generated by the appellant's arrest for committing a felonious act while at work, the agency could no longer employ the appellant, as the fact that her arrest was publicized on local television news broadcasts and in local newspapers created a negative image for the agency. Mr. Hyde stated that he lost confidence in the appellant's ability to perform the duties of a postal employee and her actions had a direct impact on agency efficiency. Mr. Hyde also considered mitigating factors, such as the appellant's 13 years of government service and the absence of any past disciplinary record, but found that these mitigating factors did not outweigh the seriousness of the offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as the administrative judge correctly found in both the initial decision and the remand initial decision, the appellant committed an extremely serious offense and Mr. Hyde's stated loss of trust in her ability to perform her duties is reasonable. I also agree with the administrative judge's finding that there is little potential for rehabilitation because the appellant continued to deny her involvement with drugs even after she was convicted of possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under current law, to establish an impermissible disparity in penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar to those of at least one comparison employee. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans <span id="Page_2388"></span>Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Archuleta v.

To trigger the agency's burden, there must be enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the "outcome determinative" nature of these factors. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge mitigated the appellant's removal to a 90-day suspension in large part because of how the agency treated another employee, Dock McCainey, after he pled guilty to an off-duty drug-related offense. In &#x00B6; 24 of its opinion, the majority criticizes the agency for not explaining "<span class="Italic">why</span> Mr. McCainey's conduct did not warrant any discipline at all" (emphasis in original). In fact, the agency "placed McCainey on emergency suspension" when it learned that he had been criminally charged. Mr. McCainey filed a grievance, and after the criminal matter was resolved, the agency reinstated him with back pay for the period of the suspension. These actions were taken pursuant to an agreement that settled the grievance. It is inappropriate to ask the agency to explain why it treated Mr. McCainey the way it did, because evidence that the agency settled some other case is inadmissible for purposes of assessing the reasonableness of the penalty in this one. <span class="Italic">Herbert v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 M.S.P.R. 62, 70 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also Wheeler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 13 (2001); <span class="Italic">Cocchiara v. Department of Transportation</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 281, 283 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, even assuming that evidence of how the agency treated Mr. McCainey is admissible for purposes of assessing the reasonableness of the penalty, I do not believe the charges and the circumstances surrounding the behavior of Mr. McCainey and the appellant are substantially similar, for several reasons. First, the appellant and Mr. McCainey were charged with possession of different controlled substances, as the appellant was charged with possession of both cocaine and marijuana, whereas Mr. McCainey's misconduct involved only marijuana. Second, the appellant's misconduct occurred while she was still on duty, her arrest took place near agency property, and she possessed illegal drugs while on government property. Mr. McCainey's misconduct and arrest took place while he was off duty and did not occur near the worksite. Third, the appellant's misconduct was publicized, as her arrest was reported on television and in the newspaper. Mr. McCainey's arrest did not garner any publicity. Fourth, the appellant's misconduct took place more than three years after Mr. McCainey's. Fifth, Mr. McCainey pled guilty to a criminal charge, suggesting a potential for rehabilitation, while the appellant herein continued to dissemble and deny even after she was found guilty by a jury of possession of a controlled substance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these significant differences, I believe, as the administrative judge stated in the indefinite suspension initial decision, that the appellant and Mr. McCainey were not similarly situated, and thus, Mr. McCainey is not a proper comparator for disparate penalty analysis. I also note that there is no indication that the official who decided to settle the McCainey grievance was acting in accordance with agency policy or that he had authority to set agency policy. I therefore disagree with the implication in &#x00B6; 26 of the majority opinion that the agency's decision to remove the appellant was inconsistent with agency policy. Since the penalty of removal is otherwise reasonable, the administrative judge should not have disturbed it.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the McCainey settlement is admissible in support of the appellant's sex discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">see Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-24 (2003), her claim still fails. To prevail on her sex discrimination claim, "all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be 'nearly identical' to that of the comparator employee." <span class="Italic">Ly v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 481 &#x00B6; 10 (2012) (citation omitted). To be considered "similarly situated," a comparator "must have reported to the same supervisor, been subjected to the same standards governing discipline, and engaged in conduct similar to the appellant's without differentiating or mitigating circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant, who bears the burden of proving sex discrimination, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B), has not shown that she had the same supervisor as Mr. McCainey. Furthermore, there are significant differentiating circumstances between the appellant's situation and Mr. McCainey's. As explained above, Mr. McCainey's conduct involved marijuana only, it was off-duty and away from agency premises, and the criminal matter was resolved out of the public eye with a guilty plea suggesting a potential for rehabilitation. The appellant in the present case was arrested near postal premises during the workday for using marijuana and cocaine, her situation was reported in the press, and she continued to deny her involvement with drugs even after she was convicted of possession of a controlled substance. The appellant's case cannot be considered "nearly identical" to Mr. McCainey's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The 2010 shift in the law should be reconsidered.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that among the factors an agency should consider in setting the penalty for misconduct is "consistency of the penalty imposed with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. For decades after <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> was decided, for a disparate penalty claim to succeed the Board required close similarity in offenses between the appellant and the comparator(s), and that the appellant and the comparator(s) worked in the same unit and for the same supervisor. <span class="Italic">E.g., Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 7 (2005); <span class="Italic">Fearon v. Department of Labor</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 428, &#x00B6; 11 (2005); <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 185, 191-92 (1990); <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983). All that changed two years ago, when the Board issued a series of decisions that in my opinion relaxed the test for impermissible disparity in penalties. Under current precedent, established before my presence on the Board, broad similarity in misconduct between the appellant and the comparator(s) is sufficient to shift the burden to the agency to explain the difference in treatment, and the universe for potential comparators is worldwide. <span class="Italic">See Villada</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12; <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I believe there are reasons to question the 2010 shift in the law. The primary basis for the new approach is <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2009), where the court questioned the validity of requiring that the appellant and comparator employee(s) worked for the same supervisor. However, an earlier panel of the court explained that 5 U.S.C. ch. 75 is intended to guard against agencies "knowingly" treating similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Facer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 836 F.2d 535, 539 (Fed. Cir. 1988). It is undisputed that the deciding official in the present case was not the official who agreed to settle the McCainey grievance, and it is not clear that the deciding official herein even knew about the McCainey settlement or what the terms of that settlement were. This alone justifies a difference in treatment, as long as the penalty in this case is otherwise reasonable under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">My concern is that the <span class="Italic">Villada-Woebcke-Lewis</span> trilogy attempts to promote a universal consistency in penalty setting, without identifying any legitimate individual interest or broad value under the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) that is being promoted. <span class="Italic">See Facer</span>, 836 F.2d at 539 (an employee does "not have a legally protected interest in the evenness of a misconduct penalty assessed on him, with that of others"); <span class="Italic">Schapansky v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 477, 485 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("unevenness" in the penalty imposed on employees who committed similar misconduct "is no ground for invalidating" the more severe penalty); <span class="Italic">Villela v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 727 F.2d 1574, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("[a] penalty that is within the authority of the agency is not rendered invalid in a particular case because it is more severe than sanctions imposed in other cases") (quoting <span class="Italic">Jones v. United States</span>, 617 F.2d 233, 238 (Ct. Cl. 1980)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in any given case, the consistency called for under the <span class="Italic">Villada-Woebcke-Lewis</span> trilogy might be rooted in an earlier disciplinary decision that was unwise, meaning that a manager would be forced to go easy on an employee who committed serious misconduct because of the <span class="Italic">unwarranted</span> leniency of some other manager in the past. Nothing in the CSRA suggests that Congress intended for those managers who have a high tolerance for misconduct to wield such influence over how their colleagues manage their own subordinates. The trilogy also raises the specter of agencies now needing to maintain massive databases of past adverse actions to consult whenever setting a penalty. Federal and state criminal systems tolerate differences in treatment; for example, a low-level drug case might be prosecuted in Fargo, North Dakota, while a similar case might be passed up in New York. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States v. Booker</span>, 543 U.S. 220, 256 (2005) ("policies of the prosecutor...vary from place to place"). I think that the CSRA's scheme for employee discipline should tolerate localized or organizational differences too, as the Board held prior to 2010, so long as the penalty in any particular case is reasonable and consistent with <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Conclusion</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I would reconsider the precedents of <span class="Italic">Villada</span>, <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>. Even under that precedent (and assuming that evidence of the McCainey settlement is admissible), the significant differences between the appellant's misconduct and that of Mr. McCainey justify a difference in treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Review of the initial decision in <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> reveals the AJ's observation that while the appellant and the comparator worked under the same plant manager at the time of the respective offenses, the appellant's plant manager changed between the time of her offense and her removal. That fact was not mentioned in the Board final decision. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-07-1000-C-1 (Initial <span id="Page_2389"></span>Decision 5/18/2012). It remains unclear whether the Board was trying to provide a basis of comparison limited to employees in a unit involving a given level, or given identity, of the deciding official. The period of time governing the comparability analysis also remains unclear. But following up on the comment in <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> that an agency may offer evidence that a penalty for an offense was too lenient in the past, <span class="Italic">Dennis v. DHUD</span>, CB-7121-12-0024-V-1 (NP 4/16/2014), stated "that an error in judgment by one deciding official several years ago should not require the agency to impose inappropriately lenient penalties in perpetuity."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mention of <span class="Italic">Woebcke,</span> the Board again addressed the element of comparable employees in a disparate penalty analysis, and expanded the scope of comparators beyond the appellant's work unit, to include at least the scope of the deciding official's organization, in <span class="Italic">Lewis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will review an agency-imposed penalty to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). The Board has articulated factors to be considered in determining the propriety of a penalty, such as the nature and seriousness of the offense, the employee's past disciplinary record, the supervisor's confidence in the employee's ability to perform his assigned duties, the consistency of the penalty with the agency's table of penalties, and the consistency of the penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses. <span class="Italic">Gmitro v. Department of the Army,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 89, &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (citing<span class="Italic"> Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 111 Fed. Appx. 610 (Fed.

Not all of the factors will be pertinent in every instance, and so the relevant factors must be balanced in each case to arrive at the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. The appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately to another employee, without a claim of prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties to be proven by the appellant and considered by the Board in determining the reasonableness of the penalty, but it is not an affirmative defense.<span class="Italic"> Vargas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983). Under the Board's recent precedent, establishing that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar has included proof that the proffered comparator was in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, and was subjected to the same standards governing discipline. <span class="Italic">Von Muller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge's analysis of the disparate penalty issue</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not appear to challenge on PFR the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Brewer was not a similarly-situated employee, and we discern no error with that conclusion, particularly since the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brewer's case occurred over four years before the incident that gave rise to this appeal and the appellant has not alleged that the same proposing or deciding officials were involved....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge made the following determinations regarding the similarity of the circumstances between Mr. Walker's case and the appellant's case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Both the appellant and Mr. Walker were charged with leaving a patient unattended that was on one-to-one observation. [Then-Medical Center Director Patricia O.] Pittman was the deciding official in both cases. However, the proposing officials differed.... More importantly, Ms. Pittman never testified she sustained the charge as stated in Mr. Walker's proposal letter. Instead, Ms. Pittman testified that there were inconsistencies in the proof that gave her concern. Nor does the decision letter state that the charge was sustained. Thus, I find that the charge as stated in Mr. Walker's proposed removal letter was not sustained. Ms. Pittman did sustain the reason stated in the appellant's notice of proposed removal. Consequently, Mr. Walker is not a similarly[-] situated employee when reviewing or making a penalty determination in the appellant's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no basis for the administrative judge's conclusion that Ms. Pittman did not sustain the charge against Mr. Walker or that she sustained a lesser included offense. Ms. Pittman issued two letters to Mr. Walker on January 23, 2009. The first letter, referencing the December 19, 2008 Notice of Proposed Removal, noted that the appellant provided a written reply and an oral response and indicated that a written counseling letter would be issued in lieu of removal. The second letter was the Written Counseling Letter itself. While neither letter used the term "sustain," the Notice of Proposed Removal contained a single charge of Violation of Nursing Service Policy 118-7-2, Suicide and Homicide Observation, and there was no indication that Ms. Pittman did not sustain the charged misconduct. Rather, it is obvious that Ms. Pittman sustained the charged misconduct; otherwise, there would be no basis upon which to issue the counseling letter which specifically referenced the same misconduct described in the proposal notice. Therefore, we conclude that Ms. Pittman sustained the single charge against Mr. Walker.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are several similarities between the circumstances of Mr. Walker's misconduct and the appellant's misconduct. Both were charged with identical misconduct, violation of Nursing Service Policy 118-7-2, and the same removal penalty was proposed for such misconduct. Moreover, the appellant admitted in his testimony that he was assigned to Patient W, that Patient W had to be on one-to-one monitoring, and that he had to be at arms length while observing someone on one-to-one monitoring. Likewise, Mr. Walker admitted that, at the time of his offense, he knew the patient that he was assigned to monitor had to be on one-to-one observation, he was aware of the protocol for suicidal patients, and he knew that one-to-one monitoring meant that he had to be within arms length of the patient.[2] Mr. Walker's misconduct occurred approximately seven months after the appellant's misconduct. Finally, the same agency official, Ms. Pittman, rendered the decisions in the appellant's case and Mr. Walker's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The patient who Mr. Walker was supposed to be observing was found unattended with a monitor cord wrapped around his neck, apparently trying to commit suicide. Thus, the result of his misconduct appears to have been more serious than that in the appellant's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the nature of the misconduct itself was remarkably similar, we recognize that there are some differences in the circumstances of the appellant's misconduct and Mr. Walker's misconduct, namely that the appellant and Mr. Walker did not work in the same work unit at the time of the misconduct, the appellant has not alleged that he and Mr. Walker had the same supervisor, and there were different proposing officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances presented in this appeal, we conclude that the appellant and Mr. Walker are similarly situated for disparate penalty analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, for the consistency of the penalty factor to be considered in a penalty determination, there must be a great deal of similarity, not only between the offense(s) committed by the appellant and a proposed comparator, but as to other factors, such as whether the employees were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time. In the past, the Board has considered some of these factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, as outcome determinative; if the "comparator" was not in the same work unit, there could be no determination that disparate penalties were imposed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Von Muller,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 22 ("With the exception of Hoyle, who was also removed, no other target of the agency's investigation was in the appellant's work unit.... Thus, [deciding official] Norman had no obligation under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> to consider the consistency of the appellant's removal with other disciplinary actions arising from the investigation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has recently indicated that a more flexible approach is warranted under the circumstances presented by this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 586 F.3d at 1366, the court addressed a situation in which the agency removed Mr. Williams for his participation in an income tax fraud "sponsored by" another agency employee, Mr. Edwards. One of Mr. Williams' claims before the administrative judge was disparate treatment because the agency allegedly reemployed Mr. Edwards even though he (Mr. Edwards) was more culpable than the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge rejected the appellant's disparate treatment claim in a footnote, stating: "[t]he testimony regarding Edwards['] return to the workplace is not relevant because Edwards was not in the chain of command of this supervisor and therefore is not similarly situated for purposes of a claim of disparate treatment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368. The administrative judge upheld the removal and the Board affirmed the administrative judge's decision by Final Order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the court stated that the fact that the supervisor that testified did not directly supervise Mr. Edwards did not make his testimony regarding disparate treatment irrelevant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While the fact that two employees are supervised under different <span id="Page_2390"></span>chains of command may sometimes justify different penalties, in this case the administrative judge has not explained, and the record does not reveal, why the different chains of command would justify the agency treating Edwards, the perpetrator of the tax fraud, more favorably than Williams, who merely had participated in it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1368-69. Because the factual record was not fully developed with respect to the agency's actions regarding Mr. Edwards's employment, the court remanded the appeal for further development of the record, for findings on this issue, and for reconsideration and redetermination of the penalty.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> we hold that there must be enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently, but we will not have hard and fast rules regarding the "outcome determinative" nature of these factors.[4] To the extent that <span class="Italic">Fearon</span> and other cases are inconsistent with this analysis, they are hereby modified.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Similarly, consistent with the court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> factors such as whether an agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, whether the difference in treatment was knowing and intentional, whether an agency began levying a more severe penalty for a certain offense without giving notice of a change in policy, and whether an imposed penalty is appropriate for the sustained charge(s) are all relevant considerations but not outcome determinative nor threshold requirements in disparate penalty analysis under <span class="Italic">Douglas.</span> To the extent that <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 423 1111 (2009), <span class="Italic">Quander v. Department of Justice,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 419, 423 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table) and other cases are inconsistent with this analysis, they also are hereby modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This holding is not intended to modify <span class="Italic">Spahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195 (2003), or any other cases that discuss whether employees are similarly situated under Title VII discrimination law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As applied to the instant case, we conclude that there is enough similarity between the nature of the misconduct and the other factors to lead to an inference that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. Because we conclude that the appellant and Mr. Walker are similarly situated, and thus, Mr. Walker is a proper comparator for disparate penalty analysis, the burden shifts to the agency to prove a legitimate explanation for the different treatment meted to the appellant and Mr. Walker. <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Woody,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. at 488. We need not reopen the record because Ms. Pittman addressed this issue in her testimony at the remand hearing. She explained that the difference in penalties was due to certain mitigating factors in Mr. Walker's case, namely the factual inconsistencies in the circumstances surrounding his misconduct, the fact that he had no prior discipline, and her belief that he had not been trained on the one-to-one monitoring policy, having recently returned from a tour in Iraq. (Ms. Pittman further acknowledged in Mr. Walker's Written Counseling letter that the one-to-one monitoring procedures may have been "somewhat lax in the Emergency Room" in the past, and she cited this as an additional reason for issuing Mr. Walker a written counseling instead of a removal). Conversely, she noted that the appellant had prior discipline. Indeed, the record shows that the appellant was previously suspended for 14 days, from April 24, 2005, through May 7, 2005, based on four charges of misconduct, including two charges of disrespectful conduct, one charge of deliberate refusal to carry out a proper order, and one charge of absence without leave. These charges are not related to the charge at issue in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Pittman's explanation could justify a harsher penalty for the appellant than for Mr. Walker, it does not justify the appellant's removal, as compared to the Written Counseling Letter that was issued to Mr. Walker, based on his virtually identical misconduct that occurred only seven months later.<span class="Italic"> See Williams,</span> 586 F.3d at 1368-69. We therefore conclude that the agency failed to prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence, consistent with our prior Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">Lewis,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A 30-day suspension is the maximum penalty for the sustained misconduct</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that Ms. Pittman sustained the single charge against Mr. Walker, Mr. Walker is a proper comparator in this appeal, and the agency did not offer a legitimate explanation for the different penalties meted to the appellant and Mr. Walker, we vacate the RID with respect to its conclusion regarding Mr. Walker as a comparator and the penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 423, 'VII 12-13 (2009) (vacating the portion of the initial decision that affirmed the removal penalty and concluding that "a 30-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty given the penalties the agency imposed on the two comparative employees," <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> a 15-day suspension and a 30-day suspension, respectively). We need not remand the appeal for a penalty determination because the record is fully developed on this issue. Taking into account all of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we further find that the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's misconduct is a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Cf. Murdock-Doughty v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 119, 123-24 (1996) (concluding that a 45-day suspension, not removal, was an appropriate penalty for the appellant's misconduct, which included refusing to comply with proper orders related to patient care).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> was cited, without disapproval, and without discussion of Board decisions after <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, in <span class="Italic">Miskill v. SSA</span>, 863 F.3d 1379, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor at issue here is the "consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offences." 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. To establish disparate penalties, the employee must show "that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar," which includes "proof that the proffered comparator was in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, and was subjected to the same standards governing discipline." <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, 660 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Lewis II</span>).

Dep't of Labor</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 428, 434 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A comparator is an employee that "was in the same work unit, with the same supervisor, and was subjected to the same standards governing discipline." <span class="Italic">Lewis II</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. at 660. There is no strict requirement that employees subject to the same standards governing discipline must always receive precisely the same penalty. But similarly situated employees must be subject to the same criteria, and differences in penalties must depend on specific factual differences between those employees. That consideration is, by its nature, a case-dependent, highly factual inquiry and not amenable to bright-line rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Arbitrator erred by imposing a categorical rule of exclusion, i.e., that similarly situated employees under investigation could not be comparators. It is true that, in some circumstances, an ongoing investigation may be a legitimate basis to exclude an employee as a comparator. But that depends on the factual circumstances. Here, the facts strongly suggest that it was improper to exclude the eight employees as comparators simply because they were under investigation <span class="Italic">at the time of the arbitration</span>. After Ms. Miskill's removal in September 2013, the Agency knew or should have known that there were potential problems with the implementation of time and attendance polices in the DNE unit. Yet the Agency waited to begin its investigation of the eight other DNE employees for almost two years and, in fact, did not initiate an investigation until it discovered that Ms. Miskill was alleging disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Villada v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 268, 273 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 232 (2010) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), except to the extent the decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Williams v. SSA</span>, 586 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2009)), also mentioned in <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, considered the appeal of an equipment mechanic removed for possessing and using marijuana after hours while attending a training course. The drug was used on the grounds of the hotel at the agency's employee development center. Nexus was not at issue. An OIG investigation showed that other mechanics also used marijuana in the same gathering with appellant, but those employees were from different parts of the country. There was some evidence that the other employees returned to work. The Board remanded the appeal, noting <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> and <span class="Italic">Williams</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here appears to be substantial similarity in the conduct in which the appellant and the comparators participated. However, the record is not fully developed as to the circumstances of the discipline, if any, imposed on the comparators and why different chains of command or other factors would justify different penalties. Because the facts necessary to resolve the question of whether the appellant was subjected to a disparate penalty and whether the agency met its corresponding burden to show a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment are not in the record, it is necessary to remand this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A work unit analysis was followed in <span class="Italic">Brantley v. USPS,</span> DA-0752-14-0590-I-3 (NP 4/15/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegation that the agency treated him disparately to another employee, without claiming prohibited discrimination, is an allegation of disparate penalties. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 5 (2010). The appellant has the initial burden of showing that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20, 24 (2012). To "trigger" the agency's burden of production on disparate penalties, the appellant <span id="Page_2391"></span>must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors, such as whether he and the comparator were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time, to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">McNab v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6; 5 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, we discern no evidence or argument on review indicating that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the appellant's misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20, 24. The appellant argued on appeal that he shared a second-level manager with the alleged comparator and that they engaged in similar conduct because they were subject to the same disciplinary standards and arrested for allegedly committing crimes that could result in imprisonment. We find, however, that the nature of their alleged misconduct and other factors lack sufficient similarity for a disparate penalties analysis. The undisputed record reflects that they held different positions and reported to different first-line managers, and that different proposing and deciding officials took different adverse actions against them based on different charged misconduct after their arrests for allegedly committing different felony offenses under vastly different circumstances. The alleged comparator's situation is also distinguishable from the appellant's because he requested and received FMLA leave based on his medical inability to work immediately after his arrest on felony charges of accessory after the fact to an armed robbery with a firearm. According to the sworn declaration of the District Human Resources Manager, the appellant was not entitled to paid administrative leave under agency policy based on his inability to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant does not dispute that the agency proved the charge underlying his indefinite suspension based on his indictment and his admissions in the documents supporting his arrest. In contrast, the alleged comparator received paid administrative leave during an agency investigation after her arrest for aggravated battery, which she claimed was self-defense. After completing its investigation, but before the court decided her criminal case, the agency removed the alleged comparator from her Safety Manager position based on the charge that she assaulted a young woman by throwing bleach in her face. The nature of her alleged misconduct and other factors are not similar to the appellant's, who remains employed by the agency as a Postmaster after his criminal conviction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant failed to meet his initial burden of production, he failed to trigger the agency's burden of proving it had a legitimate reason for the different treatment by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 17. Accordingly, we need not consider the remaining arguments raised by the appellant disputing the evidence and argument submitted by the agency as proof that there was a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment. Moreover, unlike the appellant, the agency removed the alleged comparator before her criminal case for alleged aggravated battery was resolved by the court. The agency did not treat the alleged comparator less harshly than the appellant who remains employed by the agency after pleading guilty to an amended charge of resisting arrest.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "work unit" analysis was broader in <span class="Italic">Marquand v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-14-0636-I-1 (NP 7/7/2016), involving removal for failure to obtain a contracting certification within a set time:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's request for the disciplinary records of agency employees charged with the same or similar offenses as the appellant was overly broad insofar as she requested the records of DOD employees nationwide, rather than DCMA employees in AT&#x0026;L positions. However, we find that the administrative judge disregarded Board precedent regarding disparate penalties and abused her discretion in her discovery rulings by effectively limiting the pool of potential comparators to employees in the deciding official's chain of command during the same time frame as the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15 (2010); <span class="Italic">see Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (2012) (holding that a flexible approach is warranted when considering the consistency of the penalty with those imposed on comparator employees). Specifically, the Board has held that, to trigger the agency's evidentiary burden on disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is "enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the 'outcome determinative' nature of these factors." <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15. If an appellant does so, the agency then must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by preponderant evidence before the penalty can be upheld. <span class="Italic">Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's discovery request relating to potential comparator employees was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Specifically, if she could show that the agency treated her more harshly than other employees for similar misconduct, she would have triggered the agency's burden to explain the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16. In making this finding, we are guided by the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Figueroa v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2013), a removal appeal in which the appellant raised a claim of disparate penalties. During discovery, the appellant requested documentation relating to disciplinary actions imposed on supervisory employees for the same or similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4. The administrative judge denied the appellant's request based on his finding that it did not appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. The Board found that such a result was contrary to its instructions in <span class="Italic">Boucher</span> and <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> and that the administrative judge therefore abused his discretion in denying the appellant's motion to compel discovery. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. Accordingly, the Board vacated the administrative judge's finding that the penalty was reasonable and remanded the appeal for further discovery and issuance of a new initial decision addressing the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the information requested by the appellant also is potentially relevant to one of her affirmative defenses, specifically, her claim that the agency violated her right to due process when the deciding official considered several factors enumerated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), as aggravating factors in determining the appropriate penalty even though the notice of proposed removal does not reference any of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that, when a deciding official receives new and material information by means of an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication, "a due process violation has occurred and the former employee is entitled to a new and constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The record shows that, in determining the appropriate penalty, the deciding official considered the effect of the appellant's failure to obtain DAWIA Level II Certification on "the need for employees similarly situated to meet the condition of employment." Given the deciding official's reference to similarly situated employees in his <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis, further discovery regarding comparator employees might lead to relevant evidence regarding the appellant's due process claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall permit the discovery requested by the appellant regarding DCMA AT&#x0026;L employees for the 5-year period preceding her removal. After the completion of discovery, the administrative judge shall provide the parties an opportunity to submit supplemental evidence and argument into the record. The administrative judge also shall afford the appellant a hearing, if requested, limited to the disparate penalty and due process issues discussed above and shall issue a new initial decision addressing the reasonableness of the penalty and the due process claim discussed above, consistent with this order. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGrath v. Department of the Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 20 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The post-<span class="Italic">Lewis</span> analysis of treatment of comparable offenders has not abandoned the necessity for demonstrating similarity of the comparators' offenses, <span class="Italic">Voorhis v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 538, 552-53 &#x00B6; 32, 2011 MSPB 67 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts in his petition for review that the penalty of removal imposed against him is inconsistent with the agency's treatment of Mr. Rouco, who remains employed as a Supervisor Criminal Investigator and undisciplined, after he was found to have perjured himself in federal district court. Here, there is little similarity between the nature of the appellant's proven misconduct and the nature of Mr. Rouco's alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). While the appellant was charged with making unauthorized queries in federal databases and unauthorized disclosures, misusing his position, and exhibiting a lack of candor in interviews with OPR investigators, the appellant has failed to suggest that Mr. Rouco engaged in similar misconduct, aside from an allegation of lack of candor in potentially committing perjury during the appellant's criminal trial. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to prove his claim of disparate penalties. Further, given the administrative judge's thorough analysis of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and the deciding official's thorough testimony and written statement regarding his consideration of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the penalty of removal is reasonable in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ly v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 118 MSPR 481, 487-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16, 2012 MSPB 100 (2012), considered the knowledge of the deciding official of what was argued by the appellant to be a disparate penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that the charges and the circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 407 (1983)). Other factors may include whether the difference in <span id="Page_2392"></span>treatment was knowing and intentional, whether an agency began levying a more severe penalty for a certain offense without giving notice of a change in policy, and whether an imposed penalty is appropriate for the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15 n.4 (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2009)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant shows that the charges and circumstances surrounding the charged behavior are substantially similar, "the agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment by a preponderance of the evidence before the penalty can be upheld." <span class="Italic">Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (quoting <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6). To trigger the agency's burden, there must be enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly situated employees differently, but the Board will not have hard and fast rules regarding the "outcome determinative" nature of these factors. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's burden has not been triggered here. As noted above, there are differences not only between the offenses committed by the appellant and Mr. Thorne but also in that there is no indication that the appellant and Mr. Thorne were in the same work unit or had the same supervisor. Specifically, Mr. Thorne failed to disclose that he was dismissed from two prior jobs for "not possessing the necessary skills" and as a result of a "cutback in workforce" respectively, while the appellant failed to disclose that she was dismissed from ASQ and FATS for "unfavorable employment or conduct" and was "not eligible for rehire." Furthermore, the deciding official testified that he did not know Mr. Thorne or the circumstances surrounding his failure to disclose or the subsequent decision to issue him a letter of caution, indicating that any difference in treatment between the appellant and Mr. Thorne was not knowing and intentional on the part of the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, there is no evidence that the agency necessarily began levying a heavier penalty without notice, as the record indicates that since 2009 three other agency employees failed to disclose that they were terminated from prior positions and that each of those employees chose to resign following management's recommendation of termination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 120 MSPR 457, 465-66 &#x00B6; 15, 2013 MSPB 100 (2013), comparing discipline of the appellant, who was not a supervisor, and the conduct of a manager, did not mention <span class="Italic">Ly</span> but considered the deciding official's lack of knowledge of past offenses and the supervisor's testimony of what his action would have been as to the manager's conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an agency is not foreclosed from proffering evidence that the penalty for a certain offense was too lenient in the past. <span class="Italic">See Boucher</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 27. The deciding official credibly testified that he considered whether the appellant's penalty was consistent with penalties imposed on others for similar offenses in his penalty determination, and that he was unaware of any similarly-situated individuals. In explaining why the removal penalty was appropriate in the appellant's case, considering his lack of prior discipline and years of service, the deciding official testified that he decided against imposing a lesser penalty because he was not <span id="Page_2393"></span>convinced that the appellant would not engage in the same serious misconduct with his own supervisors in the future. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The deciding official further testified that he was unfamiliar with the Maintenance Manager or the circumstances of his discipline, but that he would have removed the Maintenance Manager if he had been the deciding official in that case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again addressing knowledge of management of comparators offenses, <span class="Italic">Howerton v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-13-0292-I-1 (NP 8/21/2014), rejected appellant's comparability argument when management did not know of offenses of other employees, information about those offenses was not contained in agency personnel files, and, when information about the alleged comparators was brought to the attention of the deciding official (in an unusual way--at the PFR level on a request by the Board from the parties for more information about the comparators, their offenses, and the deciding official's analysis of that information), the deciding official offered valid reasons distinguishing the appellant's offense from those of the alleged comparators:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we believe that the appellant identified individuals who were similarly situated to him in terms of their criminal records but whom the agency treated differently. As such, the burden shifts to the agency to proffer a legitimate reason for removing the appellant, who received no jail time for his off-duty misconduct, while imposing no discipline at all on the comparators, some of whom received jail time for off-duty misconduct that was equally, if not more serious, than his misconduct. We find that the agency has met this burden here. In his affidavit, the deciding official explained that none of the comparator employees identified by the appellant were arrested at work and that he was unaware of their off-duty misconduct until he was presented with information concerning these employees from the appellant. In this regard, we note that the information provided by the appellant concerning these comparators was derived from his search of public court records; there is no indication that any of this information could have been discovered by reviewing the agency's personnel records; and there is no evidence that the comparator employees' supervisors were aware of the comparator employees' off-duty misconduct. By contrast, the deciding official stated that he was directly aware of the appellant's off-duty misconduct because he was arrested on the agency's Mechanicsburg, PA installation during duty hours and in the presence of his coworkers and because his arrest, which involved multiple law enforcement officers, created a "spectacle" on the installation that resulted in an official report concerning the incident and an order barring the appellant from the facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official also stated in his declaration that it appeared from his review of the appellant's materials that the four comparators had lesser-graded offenses than the appellant; that every conviction except one was either a misdemeanor or a summary offense; and that the jail time served by the comparators appeared to be because the four comparators each had DUIs. The deciding official further stated that the agency has never considered a DUI to be as serious of a criminal offense as drug dealing. Thus, whereas the agency has granted work releases to employees who pleaded guilty to DUIs that resulted in incarceration and would potentially grant a work release to an employee involving drug use if the employee enrolled in its alcohol and drug prevention program, the deciding official stated that the agency has never approved a work release request for an employee with a drug distribution conviction and he would not do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the record as a whole, we find that the deciding official conscientiously considered the consistency of the penalty as required by <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. The agency has established that it imposed the same discipline in this case that it had imposed with respect to a nearly identical comparator employee. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record indicating that the difference in treatment between the appellant and the comparators he identified was knowing or intentional or because the agency began levying a more severe penalty for a charged offense without giving notice of a change in policy. Rather, it appears that the lack of discipline in those employees' cases was either because the agency was unaware of the nature of their misconduct, or, to the extent that it was aware, it had reason to believe that the jail time served by these employees was for lesser offenses such as a DUI.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Seay v. TVA</span>, 339 F.3d 454, 479-80 (6th Cir. 2003), departed from the strict identity of offenses and work units to permit practical appraisal of comparable offenses in a civil rights case that was dismissed on summary judgment by the district court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff also argues that the district court erred in dismissing Count 129 (racially disparate treatment regarding Plaintiffs suspension) because genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether TVA engaged in racial discrimination in violation of Title VII by suspending Plaintiff for sixty days when it suspended white violators of the policy for only thirty days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> claim of disparate treatment, a plaintiff must "produce evidence which at a minimum establishes (1) that he was a member of a protected class and (2) that for the same or similar conduct he was treated differently than similarly-situated non-minority employees." <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Toledo Hosp.,</span> 964 F.2d 577, 583 (6th Cir. 1992). Moreover, "the plaintiff must show that the 'comparables' are similarly-situated in all respects, absent other circumstantial or statistical evidence supporting an inference of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Ercegovich v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.,</span> 154 F.3d 344, 352 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 964 F.2d at 583) (internal quotation marks omitted). This means a plaintiff must "prove that all of the relevant aspects of his employment situation were 'nearly identical' to those of [the non-minority's] employment situation." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Commonwealth Life Ins. Co.,</span> 40 F.3d 796, 802 (6th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties dispute whether Plaintiff can satisfy the "similarly-situated" requirement. Plaintiff points to four employees: Danny Seal (no discipline), Tanveer Khalid (no discipline), Guy Kidd (thirty-day suspension), and Roy Mason (thirty-day suspension). Although these employees all misused TVA vehicles and received less discipline, the facts surrounding Seal's, Khalid's, and Kidd's violations differ in relevant respects from the facts surrounding Plaintiffs violation. In the cases of Seal and Khalid, TVA's investigation determined that their respective supervisors had approved their misuses of the TVA vehicles (and therefore those employees were not disciplined because they did not willfully violate the policy), whereas nobody had approved Plaintiffs misuse. Plaintiff has offered nothing to contradict the accuracy of this finding. Kidd used a TVA vehicle to take his wife and neighbor to church on one occasion, whereas Plaintiff received a sixty-day suspension because he misused a TVA vehicle "on two separate occasions." Because of these relevant differences, we do not believe that these three non-protected employees Plaintiff identified are sufficiently "similarly-situated" for Plaintiff to establish his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Plaintiff has also identified Roy Mason, a white employee who had used a TVA vehicle to haul his boat to a lake. The record indicates that Mason's violation was not approved by any of Mason's superiors and <span id="Page_2394"></span>that the violation occurred on two occasions. Despite these similarities, Mason was suspended for only thirty days, while Plaintiff received sixty days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">TVA nevertheless asserts that Mason is not similarly-situated because he and Plaintiff worked in different TVA departments and had different supervisors. It is true that similarly-situated employees ordinarily "must have dealt with the same supervisor, have been subject to the same standards and have engaged in the same conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it." <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 964 F.2d at 583 (citations omitted). However, the "same supervisor" criterium has never been read as an inflexible requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement is particularly problematic here, where a violation such as vehicle misuse does not occur frequently enough to invite such a direct comparison within a compartmentalized organization. <span class="Italic">See Ercegovich,</span> 154 F.3d at 353 (noting that inflexible criteria for establishing the similarly-situated requirement would mean that "a plaintiff whose job responsibilities are unique to his or her position will never successfully establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case (absent direct evidence of discrimination)"). In such cases, we have emphasized the importance of "mak[ing] an independent determination as to the relevancy of a particular aspect of the plaintiff's employment status and that of the non-protected employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 352. Thus, a plaintiff "need not demonstrate an exact correlation with the employee receiving more favorable treatment" so long as the two employees are "similar in 'all of the relevant aspects."' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Pierce</span>, 40 F.3d at 802).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the record indicates that the decision to suspend Plaintiff for sixty days was not made in a vacuum. Several discussions took place, as well as a meeting in which participants included Johnson (Plaintiffs immediate supervisor), Walters (the Labor Relations and Safety Department manager and Johnson's supervisor), a representative from WA's human resources department (which is involved in any type of disciplinary action), and a representative from TVA's legal department. Past discipline for similar misuses was discussed at that meeting. Thus, all of the people involved in the decision-making process, including Plaintiff's immediate supervisor and the department manager, were well aware of the discipline meted out to past violators, including Roy Mason, who had violated the policy on at least two occasions. Moreover, TVA does not dispute that Mason and Plaintiff were "subject to the same standards" or that Mason's conduct included "differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their conduct or the employer's treatment of them for it." <span class="Italic">Mitchell,</span> 964 F.2d at 583. Despite the similar circumstances, Plaintiff was punished for a time period that was twice as long as Mason's. We therefore conclude that Plaintiff has demonstrated that he and Mason were similarly-situated in all relevant respects. Because Plaintiff satisfied his <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case with respect to Count 129, we reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment to TVA on this claim.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). To trigger the agency's burden, the appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time, to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 &#x0026; n.4 (2012); <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 15. However, the Board does not have hard and fast rules regarding the "outcome determinative" nature of these factors. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 15. Once the agency's burden is triggered, the Board will consider whether the agency actually treated similarly-situated employees differently, whether the difference in treatment was knowing and intentional, whether the agency began levying a more severe penalty for an offense without giving notice of a change in policy, and whether an imposed penalty was appropriate for the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15 &#x0026; n.4 (noting that these factors are consistent with the court's rationale in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Social Security Administration</span>, 586 F.3d 1365, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2009)). Again, these considerations are relevant, but not outcome determinative. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 15 n.4.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Raco v. SSA</span>, 117 MSPR 1, 10-11 &#x00B6; 20, 2011 MSPB 87 (2011) (comparing discipline administered as to several employees' offenses involving timekeeping or attendance, mitigating a removal to suspension for some minor credit hour discrepancies, and noting that although the employees "were supervised by different individuals, the agency has not explained how this difference justified a different penalty, particularly because Ms. Brockington was the deciding official in both cases. <span class="Italic">See Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 22."). <span class="Italic">But see Marceau v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-16-0215-I-1 (NP 11/17/2016) ("Specifically, we agree that the appellant's supervisory status, the attenuation between M.F.'s reassignment in 2007 and the appellant's removal in 2015 (approximately 8 years), and the different agency officials involved in both cases provide a legitimate reason for the difference in penalties. We additionally defer to the administrative judge's factual findings that the deciding official consistently imposed removal in similar cases in which he served as the deciding official, and that he considered reassigning the appellant but determined that there were no vacant positions into which the appellant could be transferred.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However it is analyzed, comparability of penalties is but one factor in a mitigation analysis, <span class="Italic">Dennis v. DHUD</span>, CB-7121-12-0024-V-1 (NP 4/16/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors focus on the individual circumstances and offenses of the employee being disciplined. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. Not all <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are pertinent in every case, and selection of an appropriate penalty therefore involves a responsible balancing of the relevant factors in the individual case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The consistency of the penalty with those imposed on other employees for the same or similar offenses is only one factor to be considered in determining the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). Thus, the fact that prior discipline factored differently in one case versus another, without more, does not demonstrate that the law is improperly or inconsistently applied. As such, we find this argument wholly unpersuasive.</p>
