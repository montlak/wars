<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-94"><span class="space">3.</span> Collateral Work Assignment; "Other Duties as Assigned"</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 224 (1987), ruled negotiable a proposal that recognized the right to assign work and that then reflected an agreement that nurses are professional employees whose ability to effectively perform direct patient care functions is affected by assignments comprising preparation and distribution of food trays, general housekeeping, transportation of patients, secretarial duties, and other tasks:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, Proposal 4 merely sets forth a mutual statement that certain tasks are not "ordinarily" a part of the nurses' normal work activity. The language of the proposal does not restrict the assignment of the tasks nor does it impose any criterion whereby management must make attempts to avoid certain assignments or is limited to making assignments only where specified conditions exist....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, while the proposal would require the Agency to agree to a policy or goals, of not assigning certain duties as a normal part of the nurses' work activity, the specific language of the proposal and the Union's statement of position both recognize that "the language simply cannot be used to restrict the Agency's ability to assign duties and work to the nurses."...</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_680"></span>Proposals precluding assignment of work must be distinguished from those pertaining to the manner that the work is assigned. Under <span class="Italic">ACT and Ga. NG</span>, 2 FLRA 581, 582 (1980), there was no preclusion of the negotiability of a requirement that "general cleanup" duties be assigned on an equitable basis. The proposal went to the procedure for assigning work and did not preclude management from acting at all. The intent of the proposal was to ensure fairness and equity in the assignment of general cleanup and grounds maintenance duties, not to obligate management to bargain about whether technicians, individually or collectively, would be required to perform those duties.</p>
<p class="noindent">A flat preclusion of assigned work is not negotiable. In <span class="Italic">ACT and Ga. NG</span>, 2 FLRA 581, 584 (1980), the proposal was that technicians will not be used for grounds maintenance or non-job-related activities and will not be directed to perform assignments outside their position duties without their consent. The prohibition violated management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1999 and AAFES, Dix-McGuire Exch.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished. The latter proposal did not preclude assignment of work outside the position description, but only required the position description to be amended to reflect the assignment. Another, nonnegotiable, proposal sought agreement that employees not be required to move material or equipment other than their personal property during a relocation. Although a proposal to require position descriptions to reflect assigned work accurately is negotiable, a proposal expressly precluding the agency from requiring employees to perform certain duties interferes with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375 (1987) (Proposal 3). Not negotiable was a proposal that prevented management from assigning "additional or incidental duties" to unit employees except in special circumstances or emergencies. Because the proposal precluded management from assigning duties except in the enumerated circumstances, it infringed work assignment. <span class="Italic">New York State Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Brooklyn</span>, 14 FLRA 386 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal prohibiting management from assigning personnel and labor-relations duties to clerical assistants (to avoid having them become confidential employees) was a nonnegotiable restriction on work assignment. <span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 19 and NLRB</span>, 2 FLRA 775, 777 (1980). Also nonnegotiable was a proposal that management make every effort to minimize the assignment of nurses to nonprofessional functions and specifically defined nonprofessional functions. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 468-70 (1987). <span class="Italic">Dist. 1199</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212 (1987), because "[i]n that case we found that the proposal specifically provided that the assignment of nonnursing functions was subject to management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B)." Had the proposal been revised to specifically reserve the right of management to assign work, it would have protected management's right to attend patient care needs and would have been negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 28 FLRA 1172, 1188-90 (1987), reviewed the law concerning proposals seeking to narrow "other duties as assigned" phrases, discussed earlier, appearing in position descriptions. The dispute concerned a proposal that, insofar as possible, employees would not be assigned incidental duties inappropriate to their positions and qualifications. The proposal was nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In <span class="Italic">Vint Hill Farms Station</span>, 16 FLRA 578, 580-81 (1984), the Authority held that a virtually identical provision was nonnegotiable. The Authority found that the provision--which would have required the agency to "avoid, insofar as possible, assigning additional or incidental duties to employees which are inappropriate to their positions or qualifications"--violated management's right to assign work in that it precluded the agency from requiring employees to perform certain duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, SEIU, AFL-CIO and State of Connecticut, Adjutant General Office</span>, 27 FLRA No. 86 (1987), the Authority was presented with two proposals concerned with the assignment of duties to employees, one of which was held to be nonnegotiable and the other negotiable. Proposal 2 would have limited the definition of the phrase "other duties as assigned" in employee position descriptions in order to prevent the agency from assigning menial or lower grade duties which employees were not qualified to perform, whether or not the agency amended the position descriptions to reflect assignments of the proscribed duties. Therefore, we held that the proposal was nonnegotiable, as Provision 8 is in the present case, for having the same effect as Provision 2 in <span class="Italic">Vint Hill Farms Station</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, Provision 3 in <span class="Italic">State of Connecticut</span>...merely required the agency to amend position descriptions to include certain duties where management intended to assign those duties to employees. The Authority reasoned (Chairman Calhoun dissenting) that the proposal would not interfere with management's right to assign work since position descriptions are not themselves assignments of work but merely reflect the duties and responsibilities which an agency has decided to assign to a position. Rather, the decision held that the proposal would assure accurate position descriptions by prescribing a procedure--amending the position description--which management must follow in exercising its right to assign certain duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While not discussed in the <span class="Italic">Vint Hill Farms Station</span> decision, we note here that the qualifying language "insofar as possible" does not remove the limitation imposed on management's exercise of its rights by the provision.... Rather, it would have the effect of subjecting management's determinations--that it is not possible to avoid the assignment of duties which are "inappropriate" to the position and qualifications of employees--to review in an arbitration proceeding. Thus, it would subject to arbitral review the Agency's assignments of work and permit arbitrators to substitute their judgment for management's....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1214 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Training Ctr.</span>, 45 FLRA 1121, 1128-31 (1992), analyzed and rejected as nonnegotiable Proposal 2, seeking agreement that firefighters not be required to perform duty assignments outside their position description, related duties, or regular field of work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 provides that management should not assign firefighters duties that are outside of their position description or that are unrelated to their duties or regular field of work.&#x2003;In this regard, the Union notes that "some of the duties currently assigned to firefighters...are duties that are normally performed by skilled employees under the Federal Wage System."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement.&#x2003;As noted above, to determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority must first determine whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by an exercise of a management right. Further, if the proposal is an arrangement, the Authority then determines whether the arrangement is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposal is "an attempt to ameliorate the adverse consequences of work assignments that are totally unrelated to the subject series, and that inherently present a threat of injury to the firefighters." Based on the Union's statement, we find that the proposal is intended as an arrangement for firefighters adversely affected by the Agency's assignment of duties that are unrelated to their position descriptions and outside of their regular field of work. Accordingly, we find that the proposal constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the proposal constitutes an arrangement, we next determine whether the proposed arrangement is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) or whether it excessively interferes with management's rights under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Union's contention that the proposal is "an attempt to ameliorate the adverse consequences of work assignments...that inherently present a threat of injury to the firefighters." The Agency claims, however, without dispute by the Union, that the Union's proposal is not limited to those duties which present a threat of injury, but "goes well beyond this objective by prohibiting the assignment of <span class="Italic">all</span> duties which are not job related[.]" By its terms, Proposal 2 prevents management from assigning duties to firefighters that are "outside their position description, related duties, and/or regular field of work." Consequently, the Union's explanation of the meaning of the proposal is inconsistent with the plain wording of that proposal. We will not adopt an explanation of a proposal that is inconsistent with the plain wording of that proposal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, as the Union did not file a response to the Agency's statement of position, the Union offers no further explanation to support the contention that the proposal is limited to those "unrelated duties" which inherently present a threat of injury to the firefighters. It is well established that the parties bear the burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a negotiability determination.... A party failing to meet this burden acts at its peril. Therefore, we conclude that the proposal is intended to prevent the assignment of all duties outside the firefighter's position, related duties, or regular field of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the record establishes that Proposal 2 benefits employees by restricting management's ability to assign unrelated duties to the firefighters, the record does not establish that such a benefit would be so significant as to outweigh the burden of the broadly worded limitation placed on management. Specifically, the record contains no evidence as to whether and the extent to which unit employees are assigned duties unrelated to their positions, the nature and frequency of such assignments, or the effect that such assignments have on unit employees and on their ability to perform the regular duties of their positions. Therefore, we conclude that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute and is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA arrived at a different result as to Provision 10 of <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1658 and Dept. of Army, Army Tank-Automotive Command</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1386 (1992), pressing for agreement that "[i]n so far [sic] [as] possible, for other duties as assigned, incidental duties which are inappropriate to an employee's position and qualifications normally will be avoided by the Employer." FLRA concluded <span id="page_681"></span>in <span class="Italic">AFGE 1658</span> that the proposal was an appropriate arrangement. It attempted to limit situations requiring employees to perform work either without the necessary skills or to the neglect of their regular tasks. The benefit to the employees was that they would not be evaluated on the basis of unfamiliar work and they would have more time to perform routine assignments. The agency's ability to assign work was not seriously impaired, because the provision did not preclude assignment of unusual tasks. The proposal required agency compliance "insofar as possible," meaning that, for example, the agency could determine that a particular employee was the best qualified or best suited to perform incidental duties without violating the proposal.</p>
