<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-105"><span class="space">a.</span> Harmful Error Analysis: Lack of Proper Advance Notice, Other Procedural Error</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that a probationer is terminated under the regulatory authority to terminate probationers and a formal suitability determination is not involved, what process is due a probationer terminated for preappointment reasons? Under 5 CFR 315.805(a) (2022), if an agency decides to terminate a probationer for preappointment reasons, the agency must give advance notice with reasons stated specifically and in detail. If the basis for the termination is a preappointment criminal record, for example, the agency should state in the notice to the probationer specifically what charges it relied upon and whether they were citations or arrests, as well as the dates of the charges and the places of the charges or misconduct. Lacking specificity, there is no statutory or regulatory requirement that the employee seek clarification of the charges. The agency bears responsibility for providing details in the notice to the probationer. If the appellant is deprived of fair notice of the charges and is hampered, if not obstructed, in his right to respond, the error is substantially prejudicial to the employee's regulatory rights, <span class="Italic">Hibbard v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 6 MSPR 181, 183-84, 6 MSPB 160 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in order for the agency's action to be reversed, the procedural error must be harmful. The burden of proving harmful procedural error is placed on the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(l)(A); 5 C.F.R. 1201.56(b(l); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 1 M.S.P.R. 505 (1980). Under 5 C.F.R. 1201.56(c)(3), the appellant is required to show that "based on the record as a whole the error...caused substantial harm or prejudice to his...right." Because, as we previously determined, the agency's lack of specificity and detail deprived appellant of his right to fair notice of the charges against him and of his right to properly respond thereto, we find that the agency's error was substantially prejudicial to appellant's right under 5 C.F.R. 315.805. <span class="Italic">See Money v. Anderson</span>, 208 F.2d 34, 37-38 (D.C. Cir. 1953); <span class="Italic">Burkett v. United States</span>, 402 F.2d 1002, 1004-1007 (Ct. Cl. 1968); <span class="Italic">Massman v. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 332 F. Supp. 894, 899-900 (D.D.C. 1971). We therefore find that the petition fails to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. 1201.115.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another appeal decided long ago and under a regulatory definition of harmful error more favorable to the employee determined that the total failure to follow the procedures required for termination of probationers can justify reversal of <span id="Page_153"></span>the termination for preappointment reasons. Although the agency contended that it would have terminated the appellant even if she was provided her procedural rights under 5 CFR 315.805, <span class="Italic">Padilla v. EEOC</span>, 18 MSPR 121, 126-27 (1983), involving removal of a probationer based on conditions arising before appointment (an irregular but not statutorily void appointment), concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the agency's total failure to follow any of the procedures of 5 CFR 315.805 in effecting appellant's probationary termination from the competitive service impaired her ability to defend against the action and otherwise affected the outcome before the agency so as to constitute harmful error. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 MSPB 489, 492-93 (1980). <span class="Italic">Cf. Baracco v. Department of Transportation,</span> 15 MSPR 112, 123 n.9 (1983), and the cases cited therein, where the Board recognized that an agency's complete failure to provide any of the procedural protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in effecting an adverse action constitutes harmful error. Although the agency contends that it would have terminated appellant even if she had been afforded her procedural rights under &#x00A7; 315.805, an agency action appealable to the Board may not be sustained based on how the agency might have acted had it followed proper procedures. <span class="Italic">See Horne v.

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions after <span class="Italic">Hibbard</span> and <span class="Italic">Padilla</span> have not equated deficiencies in the notice of probationary termination for preappointment reasons with automatic reversal under a harmful error analysis. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. DOJ</span>, 34 MSPR 281, 283 (1987), presented an appeal by a probationer discharged for giving a negative response to the question on his job application of whether he was previously fired or quit after being told he would be fired. The exact nature of the termination notice was unclear from the Board's decision, but the Board implied the deficiencies would be assessed under the harmful error rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge stated that the appellant was unaware of the "real reasons" for his termination because he did not address them specifically in his response to the charges, the record shows that, on the day following his receipt of the advance written notice, he was given access to the investigation report regarding the circumstances surrounding his previous firings.... In addition, the appellant filed a detailed response to questions presented to him by the agency in its inquiry concerning his background investigation.... We find, therefore, that the record does not support the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency committed harmful procedural error by failing to provide the appellant with an advance written notice setting forth the reasons for its proposed action "specifically and in detail."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the question of whether the agency committed harmful error. An employee terminated during the probationary period based on an alleged error in the appointment process is entitled to the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. <span class="Italic">Keller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency admitted below and in its petition for review that it did not provide the appellant with the written notice and opportunity to respond as required by section 315.805. Accordingly, it is uncontroverted that the agency committed procedural error; the only remaining question is whether that error was harmful to the appellant. Harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that it was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). The burden is on the appellant to show that the error was harmful. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that, had the agency provided the appellant with written notice and an opportunity to respond, he likely would have convinced the agency that he was sufficiently qualified for appointment to the position of Optometrist. In reaching this conclusion, however, the AJ relied primarily upon evidence outside the record, of which he took official notice. This evidence consisted of the appellant's medical licensure in Oklahoma and the Oklahoma statutory scheme for licensure of Optometrists. The Board or an AJ may take official notice of certain facts that are matters of common knowledge or matters that can be verified. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64. While the appellant's license to practice medicine in Oklahoma may be verified, the effect of an Oklahoma statutory scheme is something that may be subject to reasonable dispute and so should not have been taken as proven. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 13, 14-15 (1983). In addition, while the Board's regulations allow only that "parties may be given an opportunity to object to the taking of official notice," the Board has stated that it regards parties as having a right of refutation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 15 n.1; <span class="Italic">Ketchem v. Department of Transportation,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. 1, 3 (1982). The agency was given no opportunity to refute the facts of which the AJ took official notice. We therefore find that it was error for the AJ to take official notice of these facts without allowing the agency the opportunity to dispute them with evidence. <span class="Italic">See Ketchem,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we must remand the case for further adjudication. In concluding that the appellant was not qualified for the position of Optometrist, the agency relied, in part, on Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 6025.13, which requires that optometrists possess a "current, valid unrestricted professional license." The directive relied upon by the agency was reissued in 2004, however, and requires that all healthcare practitioners "maintain a current, valid, and unrestricted license or other authorizing document, in accordance with the issuing authority, before practicing with the defined scope of practice for<span class="Italic"> like specialties."</span> DoD Directive 6025.13, section 5.2.2.2 (May 4, 2004) (emphasis added).* The record currently lacks any evidence of whether the agency would consider the appellant's medical degree, medical <span id="Page_154"></span>license, and certification to practice ophthalmology to be a license to practice in a "like specialty" such that it would consider him to meet the qualifications of the Optometrist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND the appeal to the Dallas Regional Office for the submission of further evidence on the question of harmful error. If the appellant can show that his qualifications would satisfy the requirements of DoD Directive 6025.13, such that the agency likely would have found him qualified for the Optometrist position, had they given him the required notice and opportunity to respond, the AJ shall find that the agency's error was harmful and reverse the termination. If the appellant cannot make such a showing by preponderant evidence, the AJ shall find the agency's error harmless and shall affirm the termination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trujano v. DHS</span>, DA-315H-13-0116-I-1 (NP 12/18/2013), provides another analysis of harmful error analysis of a procedural defect in a probationary termination involving preappointment conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency relies on pre-appointment reasons, or on both pre- and post-appointment reasons in effecting a probationary termination, the agency must afford the employee the procedures prescribed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, i.e., notice of the proposed adverse action, a right to respond in writing, and notice of a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Jafri v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 216, 220 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). A probationary employee may appeal the agency's action to the Board on the ground that his termination was not effected in accordance with these procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c). In an appeal under section 315.806(c), the merits of the agency's decision to terminate the probationary employee are not before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Hope v. Department of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 7 (2008). Rather, the only issue is whether the agency's failure to follow the procedures prescribed in section 315.805 was harmful error; if there was harmful error, the agency's action must be set aside. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the agency does not dispute, that the agency terminated the appellant, in part, on pre-appointment reasons and that it failed to follow the procedures outlined in section 315.805. These allegations, however, only establish the Board's jurisdiction over the appellant's section 315.806(c) appeal. <span class="Italic">See Keller v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 183, 188 (1996) (The agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 in effecting the appellant's termination constitutes grounds for Board review.). Once the Board's jurisdiction is established, an administrative judge must then adjudicate whether the appellant can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's failure to follow the procedural requirements of section 315.805 was harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Hope</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8; <span class="Italic">Keller</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 183, 188-89. Harmful error, however, cannot be presumed. <span class="Italic">Hope</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 8. An agency commits harmful error only when the record shows that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The burden remains with the appellant to demonstrate harmful error by preponderant evidence.[3] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] ).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that in one of his orders to show cause, the administrative judge advised the agency that it had "the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that its action was proper in all respects." <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 11 at 2 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)] ). This is not true for a claim of harmful error, for which the burden of proof rests with the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge did not conduct a harmful error analysis of the agency's failure to comply with the procedural requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, the initial decision is REVERSED and the initial appeal is REMANDED to the administrative judge for further adjudication of whether the agency's failure amounts to harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Hope</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 11 (remanding appeal for submission of further evidence on the question of harmful error). On remand, the administrative judge should give the appellant an opportunity to reassert his affirmative defenses, should he choose to do so; the record reflects that the appellant withdrew his affirmative defenses after the administrative judge indicated that he would reverse the agency's action for failure to follow the requirements of section 315.805. Similarly, the administrative judge should also afford the appellant an opportunity for a hearing on his claim of harmful error if he wants one. <span class="Italic">See Marynowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 9 (2012).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blount v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 109 MSPR 174, 2008 MSPB 127 (2008) (remanding the appeal to the AJ to determine if there was harmful error in the appellant's termination during probation for what she alleged to be preappointment condition--the failure to file a federal income tax return--as to the postappointment assertion that she made inappropriate use of a cell phone to take photos during an agency training class).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Preappointment conditions governed the termination of a probationer who was charged with felonies, accompanied by some admissions, after his appointment, but the underlying alleged criminal conduct predated his appointment. The question became whether the agency's denial of the preappointment right to notice and an opportunity for response constituted harmful error in <span class="Italic">Fredette v. DHS</span>, PH-315H-15-0136-I-1 (NP 9/14/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant that his termination was based, at least in part, on his alleged preappointment criminal conduct. The termination notice stated that it was not in the agency's best interest to continue his employment because his "admitted conduct," which occurred prior to his appointment, was contrary to agency core values and "fails to demonstrate the integrity and character befitting a federal employee." Furthermore, the agency submitted an affidavit from the deciding official, who stated that, although the appellant informed his supervisor of his arrest at the time that he was charged, the agency did not terminate his employment until it subsequently obtained additional information, including certain details regarding the alleged criminal conduct at issue. Thus, a reasonable interpretation of the evidence of record establishes that the agency terminated the appellant's employment due, at least in part, to the nature of his alleged preappointment conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues on review that the appellant's alleged criminal conduct was merely a preexisting condition that affected his postappointment conduct or performance and, therefore, he was terminated based solely on postappointment reasons. We disagree and find that the cases that the agency relies upon in support of this argument are distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 420, 423, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 837 F.2d 1098 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table), the Board found that a probationer was terminated for postappointment reasons where he was denied a security clearance required for his position, although the basis for denying the clearance was a condition that existed prior to his appointment. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 52, &#x00B6; 8 (2010), the Board found that, even assuming that a probationer's failure to qualify for a government credit card was attributable to his preappointment credit history, his termination for failure to secure approval for the card constituted a postappointment reason for termination because securing the card was a requirement of his position, which he failed to satisfy. In <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 147, &#x00B6; 8 (2013), the Board found that, even assuming that the probationer's postappointment performance deficiencies were caused by a preexisting medical condition, her termination for deficient performance was done for postappointment reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, in the present case, the appellant did not fail to satisfy any requirement of his position as a result of his postappointment admissions and criminal charges, and his performance was not deficient. Instead, the admissions and the criminal charges merely revealed the appellant's alleged preappointment criminal conduct, which was the basis for his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Justice</span>, 524 F. App'x 660 (Fed. Cir. 2013), to be more analogous in this regard. In <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, while an individual was serving a probationary period for a Cook Supervisor position, the Bureau of Prisons Office of Internal Affairs (OIA) issued a report concluding that he had committed misconduct in a prior position as a Correctional Officer. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 524 F. App'x at 661-62. Thereafter, the agency terminated his employment based upon the misconduct at issue in the OIA report. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 662. Although the probationer's preappointment misconduct was not substantiated until the postappointment issuance of the OIA report, the court found that the Board correctly concluded that he was terminated for preappointment reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 663-64. Similarly, here, although the appellant's postappointment alleged admissions and criminal charges revealed his alleged preappointment misconduct, he was terminated based on the underlying alleged misconduct, which is a preappointment reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was terminated for preappointment reasons, he was entitled to the procedural protections set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. It is undisputed that the agency did not provide the appellant with these procedural rights, which include advance notice of the termination, an opportunity to respond, and consideration of the response. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805. Therefore, the relevant inquiry is whether the agency's failure to follow these procedures was harmful error. <span class="Italic">Hope</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established, however, that harmful error cannot be presumed; an agency error is harmful only where the record shows that it was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. Further, the burden is on the appellant to show that the procedural error was harmful. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3). Because the administrative judge found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this appeal, the record is not developed on the issue of whether the appellant met his burden of establishing that the agency would not have terminated him had it provided him with advance notice of the termination, an opportunity to respond, and consideration of his response. On remand, the administrative judge shall provide the appellant with notice of what is necessary to establish harmful error and afford the parties the opportunity to present evidence and argument on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_155"></span>In <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 12 MSPR 206, 207 (1982), the appellant asserted that the agency should have extended the time for him to reply to the proposed removal during probation because he had difficulty securing documentation. The regulation, 5 CFR 315.805(b), requires a reasonable time not to "compile evidence" but only to respond to charges and provide supporting affidavits. The case was not complex; the appellant did not demonstrate that the five-day period granted for the reply was unreasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keller v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 183 (1996) (involving the appeal of a probationer terminated based on an agency allegation that the appointment was secured by nepotism).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pope v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 476, 477-80 (1994), considered the appellant's assertion that the agency failed to provide reasonable time to answer a termination proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency appointed the appellant to the competitive-service position of Housing Management Specialist, under its outstanding Scholar Program, effective April 5, 1993. The appellant was required to complete a one-year probationary period that began on the effective date of her appointment. On November 4, 1993, the agency notified her that it was terminating her appointment, effective that day. The termination notice stated that the appellant's performance was unacceptable, and further stated that the agency had recently learned that she "w[as] not even eligible" for an Outstanding Scholar appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely petition for appeal in which she alleged that the agency had terminated her for a pre-appointment reason without affording her advance notice and an opportunity to reply, and that she was "not guilty of any wrongdoing."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to terminate a probationary employee "for reasons based in whole or in part on conditions arising before his [or her] appointment," it must give the probationer "an advance written notice stating the reasons...for the proposed action[,] ...a reasonable time for filing a written answer to the notice" of termination, and written notice of the agency's decision. 5 CFR 315.805. A probationer whose termination "is subject to [section] 315.805" may appeal to the Board "on the ground that his [or her] termination was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of that section." 5 CFR 315.806(c); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the notice of termination provided in relevant part:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">4. <span class="Italic">For these reasons</span> I have decided to separate you during your probationary period from employment with the [agency].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below, through counsel, that it terminated the appellant's appointment solely because of her performance. The agency may not retrospectively recharacterize what the deciding official expressly stated were her "reasons" for the action, however. A reasonable interpretation of the notice establishes that the agency terminated the appellant's appointment "in part," 5 CFR 315.805, because of her alleged ineligibility for an Outstanding Scholar appointment. This is a pre-appointment reason. <span class="Italic">Cf. James</span>, 55 MSPR at 126 (termination of a probationer for alleged falsification of his application for federal employment is a pre-appointment reason). The appellant, therefore, was entitled to the procedures for terminating a probationer for pre-appointment reasons<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 315.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant did not receive advance notice of her termination and a reasonable time to file a written answer. Rather, she received the termination notice after the decision to terminate her had been made, and on its effective date. Because the appellant's termination was "subject to [5 CFR &#x00A7;] 315.805," and because her termination "was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of that section," her appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. 5 CFR 315.806(c)....</p>

Department of the Army</span>, 19 MSPR 571, 575-76 (1984); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 18 MSPR 121, 126-27 (1983); 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's suggestion, whether the agency's failure to follow the appropriate procedures denied the appellant minimum due process is irrelevant. The appellant, as a probationer, was not a public employee who can only be removed for cause, and thus, her right to pre-termination "process" is not based on the Constitution. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 535, 538-39, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985). Instead, her pre-termination procedural rights are based entirely on 5 CFR 315.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This distinction is critical. If the appellant had had a constitutional right to pre-termination minimum due process, then the agency's complete failure to afford her any advance notice of her termination and a right of reply would preclude our sustaining the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681 (1991). We will not presume that the agency's failure to follow the prescribed regulatory procedures was harmful error, however. <span class="Italic">Cf. Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 682-83 (the Board will not presume that an agency's failure to follow prescribed statutory procedures for removing a nonprobationary employee was harmful). The appellant herein must show, therefore, that the agency's procedural error was "likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 685 (quoting 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] ).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the current record, we cannot determine whether the agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth in 5 CFR 315.805 constituted harmful error. The parties did not submit argument and evidence on the issue of harmful procedural error, nor did the administrative judge determine whether there were factual issues requiring an evidentiary hearing for resolution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appeal is remanded to the Washington Regional office for a determination of whether the agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 in effecting the appellants separation constituted harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-315H-13-0286-I-1 (NP 7/11/2014), discerned no harmful error as to the time allowed for the employee to respond to the probationary termination notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, even though the appellant was provided three calendar days to respond to the termination action, he failed to file a response or seek an extension of time to respond to the termination action. Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805(b) does not require that the agency provide a specific period of time for an appellant to respond to a notice of termination. The regulation merely requires a "reasonable time" for the appellant to respond to the charges. <span class="Italic">See Banghart v. Department of the Army</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 9 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 137 F. App'x 350 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Newton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant against whom an agency takes an action based on an allegedly unlawful appointment is not deprived of the procedural rights to which he would be otherwise entitled unless the appointment violates an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee is not qualified for appointment in the civil service. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Torres v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 47 MSPR 421, 422 (1991); <span class="Italic">Travaglini v.

Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 18 MSPR 142, 145 (1983). An employee terminated during the probationary period based on an alleged error in the appointment process is nevertheless entitled to the procedural requirements of 5 CFR 315.805<span class="Italic">. Padilla v. EEOC</span>, 18 MSPR 121, 126 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency terminated the appellant during his probationary period for pre-appointment reasons, i.e., his appointment was the result of actions which the agency believed violated 5 USC 3110(b), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_156"></span>A public official may not appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement, in or to a civilian position in the agency in which he is serving or over which he exercises jurisdiction or control any individual who is a relative of the public official. An individual may not be appointed, employed, promoted, or advanced in or to a civilian position in an agency if such appointment, employment, promotion, or advancement has been advocated by a public official, serving in or exercising jurisdiction or control over the agency, who is a relative of the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 USC 3110(b) prohibits a public official who exercises jurisdiction or control over the agency from appointing or advocating for appointment a relative of such official, there is nothing in this statute to indicate that such an appointment violates an absolute statutory prohibition that would render an employee so appointed unqualified for the civil service. <span class="Italic">See Torres</span>, 47 MSPR at 422; <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span>, 23 MSPR at 419-20; <span class="Italic">see also Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d at 1563-64; <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 18 MSPR at 145. Thus, the appellant here, who was terminated for pre-appointment reasons, and whose allegedly unlawful appointment was not subject to an absolute statutory prohibition, was entitled to procedural rights under 5 CFR 315.805<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 315.806; <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, 18 MSPR at 126.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who is terminated for pre-appointment reasons during his probationary period is entitled to the following procedural rights: (1) Advance, written notice stating the reasons, specifically and in detail, for the proposed action; (2) a reasonable time for filing a written response to the notice of the proposed action and for providing affidavits in support of his response, as well as consideration of his response by the agency in reaching its decision; and (3) written notice at the earliest practicable date, delivered to the employee at or before the agency's action is to be effective, informing him of the reasons for the action, his right of appeal to the Board, and the time limits in which he must submit his appeal. 5 CFR 315.805(a)-(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant was entitled to the procedures set forth at 5 CFR 315.805(a)-(c). The agency, however, merely notified the appellant in writing on March 27, 1995, that his appointment as WG-7 Maintenance Worker was cancelled because it was void under 5 USC 3110, that it did not appear that he had appeal rights to the Board, but that, in the event he wished to appeal, it was providing him with the applicable regional office address, the time limit for filing his appeal, and an appeal form. The agency did not provide the appellant with any of the remaining procedural rights under 5 CFR 315.805, including his right to respond to the termination notice, to submit supporting documentation, and to have the agency consider his response in reaching its decision. Therefore, the agency's failure to follow the procedures set forth at 5 CFR 315.805 in effecting the appellant's termination constitutes grounds for Board review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 815.806(a), (c); <span class="Italic">Padilla</span>, 18 MSPR at 126. Thus, we find that the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that his appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swango</span>, 59 MSPR at 241; <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 54 MSPR at 53.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of establishing that the agency's failure to provide him with his procedural rights under 5 CFR 315.805 constituted harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 476, 479 (1994). In an appeal under 5 CFR 315.806(c), however, the merits of the agency's decision to terminate a probationer are not before the Board. Rather, only the issue of whether the agency's failure to follow the procedures prescribed in 5 CFR 315.805 was harmful error is presented; if there was harmful error, the agency's action must be set aside. <span class="Italic">Pope</span>, 62 MSPR at 479.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that, on April 3, 1994, the appellant was appointed to the WG-7 Maintenance Worker position by Mr. Meadows and placed under the second-level supervision of Mr. Lang, his father-in-law. Further, the relationship between a father-in-law and son-in-law is included in the statutory prohibition of 5 USC 3110(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 3110(a)(3). It is also undisputed, however, that Mr. Meadows, who hired the appellant, was Mr. Lang's superior, rather than Mr. Lang's subordinate and, thus, Mr. Lang had no official authority over Mr. Meadows, including the authority to direct him to appoint or employ the appellant or to advance his employment. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. Department of the Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 621, 625 (1984) (the appellant's conversations with a public official in which the appellant inquired of job opportunities and, upon that official's request, forwarded his daughter's SF-171, did not constitute advocacy under, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 5 USC 3110, where the public official was not a subordinate of the appellant and there was no evidence that the appellant spoke in favor of, recommended, commended, or endorsed the employment of his daughter; moreover, even if the appellant's conduct revealed an interest in securing or facilitating his daughter's consideration for employment, his conduct was not improper because the public official concerned was not lower in the chain of command than the appellant); <span class="Italic">cf. Welch v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 37 MSPR 18, 22 (1988) (the appellant's stated intention of hiring his son and his order directing a subordinate employee to prepare a written justification for the temporary appointment of his son violated 5 USC 3110(b)); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. United States Postal Service</span>, 11 MSPB 106, 12 MSPR 471, 475 (1989) (the appellant Postmaster's letter urging the agency to allow his daughter to take the civil service exam and, if her grade was sufficient, to replace another employee could be construed as advancement or advocacy of appointment of a relative to a civil service position in violation of 5 USC 3110), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has asserted that Mr. Lang was in no way involved in his appointment, employment, or advancement as a WG-7 Maintenance Worker. Moreover, even if Mr. Lang had discussed, but not advanced or advocated, the appellant's employment with Mr. Meadows, Mr. Lang's conduct would not have been in violation of 5 USC 3110(b) because he was in a lower level of command than Mr. Meadows. <span class="Italic">See Alexander</span>, 24 MSPR at 625. Thus, the mere fact that Mr. Lang certified the position description for the WG-7 position, or was the appellant's second-level supervisor, does not indicate that he appointed or employed the appellant or advanced or advocated his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because, however, the agency did not afford the appellant an opportunity to respond to the charge in the termination notice, it did not consider the appellant's assertions below that: His appointment was not made in violation of 5 USC 3110(b); Mr. Meadows was a longtime acquaintance; the appellant completed item 47 on the SF-171 consistent with Mr. Meadows's direction; the appellant was unaware of the purpose of that item; Mr. Lang was in no way involved in his employment; and neither the appellant nor Mr. Lang attempted to hide their family relationship. We note that the appellant requested several witnesses to testify in his behalf at his requested hearing. Because the agency did not afford the appellant an opportunity to respond to its termination notice, the appellant could not have provided the agency with affidavits from these witnesses or other documentation in his defense for the agency's consideration in reaching its decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.805(a)-(b). Thus, we find that the appellant has shown that, if the agency had afforded him his procedural rights, he could have presented evidence that would likely have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it reached. In this regard, we find that the agency would have considered the appellant's contentions and evidence, made reasonable inquiries into exonerating facts and circumstances he would have brought to its attention, and likely concluded that its termination action was not legally supportable. Therefore, we find that the agency's failure to provide the appellant his procedural rights under 5 CFR 315.805 constituted harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Padilla</span>, 18 MSPR at 126-27.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keller</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">McKee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-315H-12-0763-I-1 (NP 10/31/2013), remanding a probationer's appeal to determine if it should be reversed for harmful error in the reply process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that: (1) the appellant's termination was based on a pre-appointment reason; and (2) the agency did not follow the procedures of section 315.805 when it terminated the appellant. We discern no basis to disturb these findings. The agency terminated the appellant for a pre-appointment reason; namely, on July 17, 2012, it discovered his "failure to provide accurate information" on his Standard Form 86 (SF-86). <span class="Italic">See James v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 124, 126 (1992) (termination for alleged falsification of employment forms is a pre-appointment reason). Further, under section 315.805, the agency was required to provide the appellant with notice of the proposed adverse action and allow him "a reasonable time" to respond to the notice. However, the appellant's termination became effective on the same date the termination notice was issued, and the notice did not provide any right of reply. Based on the foregoing, we VACATE the initial decision insofar as it dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested a hearing. As the appellant notes on review, the administrative judge did not hold the requested hearing. Because we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we must remand the appeal because the appellant is entitled to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (2006) (once an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction, he has a right to a hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the appellant will bear the burden of establishing that the agency's failure to comply with section 315.805 resulted in harmful error, in that it "is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error," thus causing "substantial harm or prejudice" to his rights. <span class="Italic">Keller</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 188-89; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] . If there was harmful error, then the agency's action must be set aside. <span class="Italic">Keller</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 189. In the initial decision, the administrative judge found that the agency's failure to afford the appellant the procedural protections of section 315.805 did not result in any harmful error because the agency "had another valid post-appointment reason to terminate the appellant." Namely, the agency claimed that it also terminated the appellant because, given his previous incarceration, he would not have been able to obtain a <span id="Page_157"></span>security clearance. However, the agency admits that this reason was not included in the termination notice. We find that the administrative judge should not have considered this <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> post-appointment reason in concluding that the appellant failed to establish harmful error because the Board has held that an agency may not retrospectively recharacterize the expressly stated reasons for an action. <span class="Italic">See Pope v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 476, 478 (1994). Thus, the administrative judge shall reassess, after conducting a hearing on remand, whether the appellant has met his burden to establish harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Banghart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 94 MSPR 453, 456-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11 (2004), reached a different result, although following the same route as <span class="Italic">Keller</span>, when an employee was removed for preappointment reasons without the procedural protections of notice of the reasons for the action and an opportunity to respond. Harmful error was not established; the termination was not disturbed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency relies on pre-appointment reasons or on both pre-appointment and post-appointment reasons in effecting a probationary termination, it must accord the appellant the procedures under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, i.e., notice, a right to answer, and a final decision<span class="Italic">. See Jordan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 388, 394 (1994). In an appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c)),[1] the merits of the agency's decision to terminate the probationer are not before the Board. <span class="Italic">Corbett v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 431, 435-36 (1981); <span class="Italic">Steele v. General Services Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 368, 372 (1981). Rather, the only issue is whether the agency's failure to follow the procedures prescribed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 constituted harmful error; if there was harmful error, then the agency's action must be set aside<span class="Italic">. See Pope v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 476, 479 (1994). To prove harmful procedural error, the appellant must show that the error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error<span class="Italic">. See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ reversed the agency's action and ordered the appellant reinstated to his former position. The AJ found that, at the time the agency issued the removal action, the appellant had a motion pending with the New Jersey court to dissolve the restraining order which precluded him from carrying a firearm, and, within 19 days after his removal, the restraining order had been officially dissolved. She further found that, if the agency had given the appellant a notice of proposed removal on March 13, 2003 (the day before the notice of removal was issued), with a right for his response to be considered, he would have been able to notify the agency of the circumstances surrounding the restraining order and the fact that he had a pending motion with the court to dissolve the restraining order. She further surmised that it was highly likely that the court order would have been dissolved during or near the end of the appellant's response period but before the agency's final decision was rendered. She also surmised that, if the court order had been dissolved during the appellant's response period, the pre-appointment reasons the agency gave for the termination and the post-appointment reasons, which the AJ characterized as "not being able to carry a weapon," might no longer have been valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant presented before the Board several documents which the AJ found were "likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." He introduced a copy of the restraining order issued in 1992 precluding the appellant from carrying a firearm issued at the request of his then-wife. He included a copy of an affidavit in which he maintained that he was unaware that the order was still in effect after his divorce was finalized in 1995, and that, when he learned the order was still effective, he initiated action to vacate the order on January 3, 2003. He also presented a copy of his motion to vacate the domestic violence order and amend his divorce judgment dated January 2, 2003, and a copy of an order from the New Jersey court which dissolved the restraining order effective April 3, 2003. With regard to the pre-appointment reasons for the appellant's termination, the AJ merely made speculative findings that, had the appellant been allowed to respond to the agency's removal action, the removal action probably would not have been effected before the appellant's restraining order was vacated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's findings are without merit. To the contrary, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805(b) does not require that the agency provide a specific period of time for an appellant to respond to a notice of termination. The regulation merely requires "a reasonable time" for the appellant to respond to the charges and to provide supporting affidavits<span class="Italic">. See Newton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 206 (1982) (three-day period for the appellant to respond to the charges was found to be reasonable and not evidence of harmful error by the agency). As noted previously, the agency notified the appellant that he was being terminated on March 13, 2003, but the court did not dissolve the restraining order until April 3, 2003. Therefore, even if the agency had complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, the appellant did not establish that it was likely that the restraining order would have been dissolved before the agency rendered its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in finding that the agency would have likely reached a different conclusion if the agency had complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, the AJ mischaracterized the nature of the agency's post-appointment reason for terminating the appellant during his probationary period. The termination letter indicated that the post-appointment reason for the appellant's termination was his failure to bring the restraining order to the attention of management even after attempting to have the order vacated. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989) (the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis). The evidence indicates that the appellant was aware of the restraining order after his divorce became finalized in 1995 and that he proceeded to initiate action to vacate the restraining order in January 2003. However, in January 2003, the appellant was already serving his probationary period for his appointment to the Police Officer position. The appellant did not tell the agency that the restraining order existed; thus, even if the order had been dissolved before the agency terminated him, this would not have altered the fact that the appellant failed to inform the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Majette v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 419, 425 (1983) (where an employee is entrusted with a dangerous instrumentality, such as a gun, incidents which reflect negatively on his judgment in using that weapon are relevant to job performance and may form the basis for an adverse action; misrepresentation when confronted by authority involves dishonesty). Under the circumstances, the appellant appears to have planned not to disclose this negative information to the agency at all or only after the restraining order was vacated by the New Jersey court. Therefore, he has shown a lack of trustworthiness toward the agency<span class="Italic">. See Crawford v. Department of Justice,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 234, 237 (1990) (a law enforcement official holds a position of great trust and responsibility and must therefore conform to a higher standard of conduct than non-law enforcement employees) (citing <span class="Italic">Quander v. Department of Justice</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 419, 421 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 180 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 153, 156 (1982) (the highest degree of professional conduct and ethics is reasonably to be expected of a law enforcement officer)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the appellant established that the agency should have complied with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 and that it was likely that the restraining order that precluded him from carrying a firearm would have been vacated prior to the date on which the agency would have made its decision to terminate him if it had complied with this section, the appellant did not establish that it was likely that the agency would have excused the fact that the appellant had failed to inform the agency of this matter nor that it was likely that the agency would not have terminated him during his probationary period based on such failure. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the agency's failure to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 constituted harmful error, and we reverse the initial decision and sustain the appellant's termination.</p>
