<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-65"><span class="space">c.</span> Arbitrator Reserves Ruling on a Remedy</h5>
<p class="noindent">If the arbitrator rules that the grievance has merit but retains jurisdiction pending attempts by the parties to work out a remedy, the award is interlocutory, not final, for purposes of exceptions, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB and SPORT ATC Org</span>., 65 FLRA 1013, 1013-14 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Because the Arbitrator found that the Agency changed the rest policy past practice before it had satisfied its bargaining obligations, the Arbitrator stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Agency and the Union shall attempt to fashion a remedy regarding the case of any bargaining unit employee who, [during the relevant time period], declined overtime as a result of the change in past practice or worked overtime or an irregular shift but was...denied administrative leave [consistent with the rest policy].</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 24. The Arbitrator retained jurisdiction "in the event the parties are unable to resolve issues regarding implementation of the remedy[,]" but noted that her jurisdiction would expire if extension of her jurisdiction was not requested by a specified date. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">...</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority "ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.11. Thus, the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 65 FLRA 603, 605 (2011). Consistent with this principle, the Authority has held that where an arbitrator declines to issue a remedy, directing instead that the parties attempt to develop an appropriate remedy on their own, the award does not constitute a final decision to which exceptions can be filed. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Navajo Area Indian Health Serv.</span>, 58 FLRA 356, 357 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Navajo</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1231-32 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Interior</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that it was undisputed that employees were adversely affected by the Agency's failure to follow the rest policy, directed the parties to "attempt to fashion a remedy" for affected employees, and retained jurisdiction in the event the parties were unable to resolve the remedy issue. Consequently, consistent with the decisions cited above, the award is not a final decision. <span class="Italic">See Navajo</span>, 58 FLRA at 357; <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 55 FLRA at 1231-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions cited by the Agency are inapposite.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">SSA </span>and <span class="Italic">Prisons</span>, the arbitrators specified the nature of the awarded remedies, but directed the parties to confer concerning the details of those remedies, such as the exact amount of costs to be recovered, <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 60 FLRA at 32, and the number of backpay claims of affected employees, <span class="Italic">Prisons</span>, 63 FLRA at 133. Here, by contrast, the Arbitrator did not specify the type of remedy to which the affected employees were entitled and merely direct the parties to agree on the details of the awarded remedy; rather, the Arbitrator left the entire nature of the remedy up to the parties to decide. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award is not a final decision and, thus, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator in this case, the parties stipulated the issues to be resolved as including the alleged violations of law and the parties' agreement, as well as the appropriate remedy. The Arbitrator declined to issue a remedy, ordering instead that the parties discuss and attempt to resolve the issue of an appropriate remedy, and retaining jurisdiction for the purpose of determining a remedy if the parties were unable to agree. Consistent with the well settled precedent set forth above, we find that the Arbitrator's award--which did not resolve the issue of an appropriate remedy--is not a final decision and thus, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find nothing in the Agency's exceptions demonstrating an "extraordinary situation[&#8197;]" warranting interlocutory review. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926; <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 55 FLRA at 1232.

<p class="noindent-1">...The Arbitrator did not make a final disposition as to a monetary remedy. Instead, he asked the parties to consider whether monetary compensation was appropriate, and he specifically retained jurisdiction to assist in resolving any disagreements with respect to a monetary remedy. As the issue of a monetary remedy has been postponed, the award does not constitute a final award subject to review. Although the Union argues that the remedy issue was not submitted to this arbitration, the Arbitrator specifically stated that the parties did not agree on the issues submitted to arbitration, and the Arbitrator did not frame the issues to preclude consideration of a monetary remedy. Any dispute that the Union has with the Arbitrator's addressing the issue of remedy must await a final award and does not operate to convert this award into an award subject to review. Accordingly, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The same result occurred in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 60 FLRA 333, 334 (2004):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator's initial award after the first part of a bifurcated process, resolved only the issue of whether the grievants were entitled to receive premium pay and other entitlements when they were excused from work on a holiday due to hazardous geological/weather conditions. The award does not resolve all the issues submitted to the Arbitrator. The fact that the Arbitrator declined to resolve the remedial aspects of the award, pursuant to the parties' agreement to bifurcate the proceedings, does not convert the initial part of the award into a final award. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 58 FLRA at 746. As such, the award is not final and complete because it does not resolve all the issues submitted to the Arbitrator, i.e., determine the specific monetary remedies owed to individual employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the award is not final, we find that the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory. Further, we find that the exceptions do not raise a plausible jurisdictional defect warranting review at this time.

<p class="noindent-1">An arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted to arbitration is not a final award subject to review.[16] An award is not final, and exceptions are considered interlocutory, when the arbitrator has declined to make a final disposition as to a remedy.[17] Consistent with this principle, the Authority has repeatedly held that where an arbitrator declines to issue a remedy, directing instead that the parties attempt to develop an appropriate remedy on their own, the award does not constitute a final decision to which exceptions can be filed.[18] However, an award is considered final, and exceptions to the award are not interlocutory, where an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction solely to assist the parties in the implementation of awarded remedies, including the specific amount of monetary relief awarded.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union does not allege that extraordinary circumstances exist. Rather, the Union contends that the award is final and the exceptions are not interlocutory because the Arbitrator resolved all of the submitted issues and all that remains are backpay calculations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree.&#x2003;The Arbitrator sustained the grievance and found that the LPNs and other clinic employees were not paid the proper locality pay. And he awarded one of the remedies the Union requested--an audit to determine the extent of the underpayments to those employees. But, pending the audit's results, the Arbitrator declined to rule on the "primar[y]" remedy the Union sought--"compensation for members of the bargaining unit." The Arbitrator declined to rule on the appropriateness of a compensation remedy because, "without [the audit results], it is impossible to [a]ward any compensation." Accordingly, the Arbitrator expressly declined, as part of the award, to order a backpay remedy. Rather, he retained jurisdiction so that, based on the audit's results, he could "fashion[&#8197;] a [backpay] remedy" and "for the purpose of resolving disputes concerning a <span class="Italic">possible</span> [backpay] remedy."[25] Consistent with Authority precedent, we find that the award--which does not fully resolve the remedy issue--is not a final decision, and thus, the Union's exceptions are interlocutory.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that there are extraordinary circumstances warranting interlocutory review.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency argues that the Authority should "determin[e] if perceptions of [an arbitrator's] impartiality come into play when an arbitrator rules on arbitrability issues" while retaining jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute. On this point, the Agency notes that an arbitrator has a financial interest in presiding over a prolonged merits hearing. However, the Authority has repeatedly declined to extend interlocutory review to alleged jurisdictional defects that do not preclude arbitration of the grievance as a matter of law.[22] Thus, the Agency has not established extraordinary circumstances warranting interlocutory review.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "[T]he Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In arbitration cases, this means that ordinarily, the Authority will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Ctrs. for Medicare and Medicaid Services, </span>57 FLRA 924, 926 (2002) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>);<span class="Italic"> AFGE National Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, </span>47 FLRA 525, 530 (1993);<span class="Italic"> Navy Public Works Ctr., San Diego, Cal.</span>, 27 FLRA 407, 408 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted does not constitute a final award subject to review. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 57 FLRA at 926; <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1246 (1990).

<p class="noindent-1">Based on the parties' arguments, the Arbitrator set forth the issues as follows: "Was there just cause for the 14-day suspension imposed on the grievant and, if not, what should be the remedy?" The Arbitrator has not rendered a final award on the entire dispute submitted for arbitration because the award made no final resolution regarding the issue of the remedy. Although the Arbitrator sustained the grievance, finding that the grievant's 14-day suspension was not for just cause, he retained jurisdiction over the matter. In the award dated February 18, 2004, the Arbitrator stated that he was unable to determine from the record whether the grievant was entitled to back pay, and requested additional submissions from the parties on the matter of<span class="Italic"> </span>back pay within 21 days of their receipt of the award. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated that after his "receipt of the parties' arguments and copies of all authorities on which they rely, a determination will be made as to whether the grievant can proceed under the Back Pay Act or on any other basis." Accordingly, the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction to consider "to a point of proper exhaustion, the grievant's prayer for an award of back pay, with interest, and recovery of her attorney fees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reflects that, on April 16, 2004, the Agency submitted a brief to the Arbitrator on the matter of back pay, and it appears that the Union responded to the Agency's submission. In a submission dated May 3, 2004, the Agency replied to the Union's response. Consequently, the issue of the remedy is still pending before the Arbitrator. Applying our precedent to this case, we find that the award is not a final decision because it does not contain a complete resolution of the remedy issue. Thus, the Agency's exceptions are interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's exceptions neither allege nor establish a plausible jurisdictional defect, the resolution of which would advance the ultimate disposition of the case. In this regard, we note that the few cases in which the Authority has granted interlocutory review have involved jurisdictional issues that arise pursuant to a statute.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., United States Dep't of Defense, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, St. Louis, Mo., </span>57 FLRA 837, 837 n.2 (2002) (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by pay statute); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash., </span>55 FLRA 1230, 1232 (2000)) (grievance validity, arbitrability determined by statutes covering bargaining unit status and classification exclusion). There is no such issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 66 FLRA 696, 698 (2012) ("where parties agree to bifurcate the arbitration process into initial merits proceedings and subsequent proceedings on appropriate remedies, an arbitrator's award that sustains a grievance on its merits but postpones the issue of appropriate remedies is not a final award subject to review.&#8197;...the parties' agreement to a bifurcated process could not convert the remand award, which expressly postpones a decision on appropriate remedies into a final award subject to review").</p>
<p class="noindent">If an award resolves the merits disputes and directs a specific remedy, the award is final and cannot be challenged through a later award resolving specific remedial disputes, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 810, 813-14 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, unlike the cases cited by the Agency, the record was sufficient for the Arbitrator to determine that a make-whole remedy was appropriate. He resolved all three issues submitted to him for arbitration: (1) he found a contractual violation; (2) he did not find a ULP; and (3) he found that employees should be made whole and reimbursed for any transit subsidy they were improperly denied, "up to the maximum non-taxable amount" allowed. Thus, while the initial award did not detail the implementation of the remedy, the Arbitrator issued a make-whole remedy that specifically included retroactive reimbursements.[60] Further, the award did not contemplate the introduction of some other measure of damages and record evidence was not required.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See e.g., CREA</span>, 64 FLRA at 490.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, to the extent the Agency argues that the supplemental award modifies the initial award, it is mistaken. The supplemental award only specifies how the parties are to implement the remedy. Although the Agency contends that the initial award failed to resolve "two overarching legal issues"--first, how the Agency could legally pay the denied transit benefits retroactively up to the non-taxable amount, and second, how cash payments may be a viable remedy--the Arbitrator did, in fact, resolve those issues, rejecting the Agency's arguments in the initial award. He found that there was no legal impediment to the award because, among other reasons, the remedy would concern retroactive, as opposed to prospective, transit subsidies. He further stated that a strong argument could be made that a voucher was not "readily available" in this case. The supplemental award did not modify the initial award. The Arbitrator merely clarified it and determined that a cash reimbursement was the best implementation option for the make-whole remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may reserve to himself the ability to sort out some disputes of the parties, and the award is not interlocutory if it decides the substantive dispute and the remedy, as in the context of a dispute over official time documentation requirements and entitlements, <span class="Italic">CREA and Library of Congress</span>, 64 FLRA 486, 489-90 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "[T]he Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." In arbitration cases, this means that the Authority normally will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, W. N.Y. Healthcare Sys., Buffalo, N.Y.</span>, 61 FLRA 173, 174 (2005). An award that postpones the determination of a submitted issue does not constitute a final award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1246 (1990). Accordingly, when an arbitrator declines to issue a remedy or directs the parties to develop an appropriate remedy on their own, the award is not a final decision to which exceptions can be filed. <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Health</span>, 58 FLRA at 357. However, if an arbitrator imposes a remedy and retains jurisdiction simply to assist the parties in the details of its application, this is not enough to render the award or exceptions interlocutory. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base, Air Force Materiel Command, Albuquerque, N.M., </span>62 FLRA 121, 123 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Kirtland</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Kirtland </span>decision, above, is most closely applicable to the instant case. Here, the issues submitted to the Arbitrator were: "Whether, since September 2006, the Union's officials have reported their official time for Union representational activities consistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and the statute, specifically 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71; [a]nd, if not, what shall be the remedy?" The Arbitrator decided both of these issues. He ruled that the official time reports did not comply with either the Agreement or the Statute, and as a remedy he ordered the Union to retroactively reconstruct its reports, supplementing them with additional information as detailed in the award. The Arbitrator retained jurisdiction to review the revised reports, but he spelled out what the consequence would be if the revised reports were still inadequate: any time claimed as official time would have to be converted to Leave Without Pay or Annual Leave, or the affected Union officials would have to elect between those alternatives. Thus, while the award leaves room for further disputes over compliance, "there is no indication that the Arbitrator or parties contemplated the introduction of some new measure of damages." <span class="Italic">Kirtland, </span>62 FLRA at 123.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although paragraph 6 of the award provides that the Arbitrator "shall make a determination of whether any of the reports continue to be inadequate or lacking in sufficient detail and also determine what the consequences should be of submitting inadequate official time reports," paragraphs 4 and 5 of the award indicate that the revised reports are to be submitted to the Agency and that the Arbitrator will become involved again only if a dispute remains concerning the adequacy of the revised reports. Thus, the award advises the Union as to what level of detail it is required to provide on its official time reports and what the remedy will be for any revised reports that do not meet that standard. To constitute a final decision, an award must impose a remedy, as the Arbitrator does here, but it need not anticipate all disputes that might conceivably arise during compliance. <span class="Italic">Kirtland, </span>62 FLRA at 123. Accordingly, we find that the exceptions are not interlocutory.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">An award is final for the purpose of filing exceptions when it completely resolves all of the issues submitted to arbitration.[47] The mistaken belief that a final award is not yet final will not excuse a party's failure to file timely exceptions.[48] While an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted is not a final award subject to review, an arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction to assist with the implementation of any awarded remedies,[49] or to resolve questions regarding attorney fees,[50] does not prevent the award from being final.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator stated that there were two issues to resolve in the original award: (1) did the Agency violate the parties' agreement, "under the statutory criteria in 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7114," when it denied the Union's information request; and (2) "[i]f so, what is the proper remedy?" By finding that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and awarding a remedy, the Arbitrator, in the original award, completely resolved all of the issues submitted to arbitration. And although the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction, he did so only with regard to implementation of the remedy and a Union request pertaining to attorney fees. These factors support a conclusion that the original award was final, and the Agency's claims do not support a contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support its claim that the original award is not final, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, National Distribution Center, Bloomington, Illinois</span> (<span class="Italic">IRS Bloomington</span>)[52] and <span class="Italic">U.S. Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span> (<span class="Italic">PTO</span>).[53] Both decisions are distinguishable from this case. In <span class="Italic">IRS Bloomington</span>, the Authority found that an award was not final because the issue of remedy was before the arbitrator and the arbitrator did not grant a remedy.[54] But here, in the original award, the Arbitrator resolved all of the issues before him, including remedy. In <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, the Authority found that an arbitrator's interim award in which the arbitrator "expressly declined to issue a final decision until the parties submitted additional evidence and had another opportunity to solve their differences," was not a final award.[55] But here, in the original award, the Arbitrator did not request additional evidence, and did not delay issuing a final award before giving the parties another opportunity to resolve their differences. Accordingly, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS Bloomington</span> and <span class="Italic">PTO</span> is misplaced.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator resolved all of the issues submitted to arbitration because he found that the Agency violated its rules and regulations by failing to assign overtime to the grievant, and he identified a remedy for the violation. Specifically, he "propose[d]" that the grievant "be given some make[-]up overtime," and retained jurisdiction to "determine that question in the event that the parties [could not] come to any agreement on it." While the Arbitrator phrased the remedy in terms of a proposal, he did not direct the parties to negotiate an alternative remedy, and the award does not indicate that he or the parties contemplate the introduction of some new measure of damages. Therefore, taking the Arbitrator's remedial discussion in context, we find that he awarded make-up overtime, directed the parties to attempt to agree to the amount of that overtime, and retained jurisdiction solely to assist the parties if they could not reach such an agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support its claim that the award is interlocutory, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of HUD</span> (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>)[22] and<span class="Italic"> U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, Small Business/Self-Employed Business Division, Compliance Area 6</span> (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>).[23] In <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, the arbitrator did not make a final disposition on the merits of the grievance. And in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the arbitrator declined to issue a remedy and instead directed the parties to negotiate one. In contrast, the Arbitrator here made a final disposition on the merits, expressly identified and awarded make-up overtime as a remedy, and left to the parties only the determination of the amount of make-up overtime that the grievant would receive. Therefore, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">HUD</span> and <span class="Italic">IRS</span> is misplaced.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.11, the Authority ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals.

<p class="noindent-1">While the Arbitrator indicated that damages were to be addressed at a later date, he also found that backpay was owed.

<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we construe the Arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction as intended only to assist the parties in computing remedies as necessary.[10] This retention of jurisdiction does not render the exceptions to the award interlocutory, and we consider the exceptions.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 43</span>, 64 FLRA 586, 589-91 (2010), determined, when disposition of the remedy was reserved, that exceptions on the merits could be reserved until the award on the remedy, but the decision showed how nuanced the distinction becomes between a merits award that is final, but some aspect of the remedy is left for disposition by the parties and later review by an arbitrator, and a merits award that is not final because the remedy is fully reserved to the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(b) of the Statute provides, pertinent part, that exceptions to an arbitrator's award must be filed "during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party[.]" <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b) ("The time limit for filing an exception to an arbitration award is thirty (30) days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party."). However, absent extraordinary circumstances, the Authority will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award until the arbitrator has issued a final decision on the entire proceeding. <span class="Italic">See id. See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.11 ("The Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1784"></span>There is no dispute that the Agency did not file its exceptions within thirty days beginning on the date of service of the merits award.&#x2003;Consistent with the above-stated principles, if the merits award completely resolved all of the issues submitted to arbitration, then that award was final for purposes of filing exceptions, and the Agency's exceptions are untimely. By contrast, if the merits award did not completely resolve all of the issues submitted to arbitration--and those issues were not fully resolved until the remedy award--then the timeliness of the Agency's exceptions would be judged relative to the date of service of the remedy award. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether the merits award was final for purposes of filing exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award is not considered final--and exceptions to such an award are considered interlocutory--when the arbitrator has not made a final disposition as to a remedy. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>In this connection, where an arbitrator did not make a final disposition as to a monetary remedy, but directed parties to determine whether a monetary remedy would be appropriate, the Authority found that the award was not final. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Customs Serv., Tucson, Ariz.,</span> 58 FLRA 358, 359 (2003). Similarly, the Authority found that an award was not final where an arbitrator found the record "inadequate and/or insufficient" to effect an appropriate remedy and directed parties to "meet for the purpose of [e]ffecting an agreement on an appropriate financial arrangement" to settle the matter. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv.,</span> 38 FLRA 587, 587 (1990). The Authority also found that an award was not final where an arbitrator found that an agency violated a collective bargaining agreement by changing employees' schedules and, without determining whether any employees were entitled to overtime, directed the parties to review the affected employees' work schedules to make that determination. <span class="Italic">See Phila. Naval Shipyard,</span> 33 FLRA 868, 868-69 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, an award was considered final--and exceptions were not found interlocutory--where an arbitrator awarded a particular monetary remedy and left to be determined only the specific amounts to be awarded. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base, Air Force Materiel Command, Albuquerque, N.M.,</span> 62 FLRA 121, 123 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss and then-Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md.,</span> 58 FLRA 498, 499 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, before the Arbitrator, the Union requested, among other things, that "affected employees be[&#8197;] made whole with back pay and lost benefits." As discussed previously, with regard to this request, the Arbitrator "note[d] that there was some anecdotal testimony that favoritism was being shown after a new policy was unilaterally implemented and that some employees who wished to stay may have been able to work while more senior employees volunteered to leave[.]" However, he stated that "this testimony was not sufficiently developed to fashion a meaningful remedy." Accordingly, he directed the parties to "enter negotiations on this matter...with the purpose of effecting a remedy[,]" and if disagreement remained after 120 days, then "an additional hearing will be scheduled...to receive evidence on this issue, following which a remedy award will be made." Consistent with these findings, the Arbitrator stated, in the "Award" section of the merits award, the following: "The Agency and the Union are directed to commence negotiations on an <span class="Italic">appropriate make-whole remedy</span> for any employee affected.... If the parties are unable to resolve that matter within 120 days...an evidentiary hearing will be scheduled to decide that matter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Stated differently, in the merits award, the Arbitrator did not find that make-whole relief was appropriate and merely direct the parties to negotiate over the details of such relief. Rather, he found that the record was insufficient to determine whether any such relief was appropriate. Thus, this situation is akin to the situations discussed above where the Authority found that an award was not final and that exceptions were interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the decisions cited in the Authority order and by the Union, both <span class="Italic">OPM,</span> 61 FLRA at 361, and <span class="Italic">Mare Island,</span> 52 FLRA at 1474-76, involved situations where arbitrators awarded a remedy in their first awards and merely provided the details of the remedies in their second awards; as discussed above, that is not the situation here. Further, <span class="Italic">Portsmouth,</span> 15 FLRA at 181-82, involved a situation where an arbitrator issued an award, retained jurisdiction, and subsequently responded to the parties' requests for clarification by reiterating findings from his award; unlike the instant case, it did not involve an arbitral direction to negotiate over a remedy and a retention of jurisdiction in the event that the parties did not agree to such a remedy. Finally, in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-45,</span> 55 FLRA 789, the arbitrator found, in his first award, that the agency violated the parties' agreement in "spirit[,]" but summarily "denied" the grievance without granting a remedy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 790. The arbitrator later issued an amended award in which he granted the grievance in part and provided a remedy directing the agency to comply with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency then filed an exception challenging only the finding from the first award that the agency had violated the "spirit" of the agreement, and the Authority found the exception untimely because the alleged deficiency arose only from the original award. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 791-93. Thus, in <span class="Italic">NAGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local R4-45,</span> the arbitrator's first award effectively was final at the time it was issued; here, by contrast, the case was still open when the Arbitrator issued the merits award. For these reasons, the decisions cited in the Authority's order and by the Union are inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that, in the merits award, the stipulated issue before the Arbitrator did not expressly include an issue as to what the appropriate remedy should be. However, before the Arbitrator, both the Union and the Agency made arguments regarding what an appropriate remedy should be. Accordingly, we find that the issue before the Arbitrator in the merits award included an appropriate remedy in the event that a violation was found and that, consequently, the merits award did not resolve all of the issues that were before the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the merits award did not become final until the Arbitrator issued the remedy award, and that the time limit for filing exceptions did not begin until the issuance of the remedy award....</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions on the merits of an award were timely as to an award that resolved the remedy through retained jurisdiction after an earlier award decided the merits, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv. and AFGE Local 407</span>, 67 FLRA 489, 490 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award is final when all the issues submitted for arbitration are completely and unambiguously resolved.[11] An award is final "where an arbitrator has retained jurisdiction solely to assist the parties in the implementation of awarded remedies."[12] However, an award is not final when the arbitrator has not made a disposition as to a remedy.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, although the Arbitrator "retain[ed] jurisdiction to resolve remedy issues," he did not order a remedy as part of the merits award. Accordingly, the merits award did not become final until the Arbitrator issued the remedy award, and therefore, the time limit for filing exceptions did not begin until the issuance of the remedy award. Thus, the Agency's challenges to both the merits award and the remedy award--which were filed within thirty days of the issuance of the remedy award--are properly before us.</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions were timely filed after an award finally resolving the parties' dispute rather than after an award that remanded the case to the parties to sort out a remedy, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions filed to an arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all of the issues submitted to arbitration<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</span>, 57 FLRA 924, 926 (2002) (HHS). In other words, the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an arbitration award until the arbitrator has issued a final decision on the entire proceeding<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Consistent with this principle, the Authority has repeatedly held that where an arbitrator declines to issue a remedy, directing instead that the parties attempt to develop an appropriate remedy on their own, the award does not constitute a final decision to which exceptions can be filed<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Navajo Area, Indian Health Service</span>, 58 FLRA 356, 357 (2003) <span class="Italic">(HHS, Navajo Area); HHS, </span>57 FLRA at 926.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to this case, the parties stipulated the issue to be resolved as "what disposition, including remedy...shall be made of the grievance...." In the initial award, the Arbitrator did not render a final award on the entire dispute, because the Arbitrator did not fashion a complete remedy. Instead, the Arbitrator ordered the parties to discuss and attempt to resolve a significant part of the remedy and retained jurisdiction for the purpose of resolving the remedy issue if the parties could not do so. Therefore, consistent with Authority precedent and contrary to the Union's assertion, the Arbitrator's initial award was not a final award. The award did not become final until the Arbitrator issued the May 23, 2003 award resolving the entire dispute. Accordingly, as the Agency's exceptions were filed within 30 days of the final award, they were timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an arbitrator resolved that an employee's performance appraisal was improper and remanded the rating to the agency for reevaluation according to the arbitrator's instruction, the award was not interlocutory when the arbitrator retained jurisdiction to entertain concerns about compliance, <span class="Italic">DHS, ICE and AFGE Local 511</span>, 66 FLRA 880, 883 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations pertinently provides that "the Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.11. Thus, the Authority ordinarily will not resolve exceptions to an <span id="page_1785"></span>arbitration award unless the award constitutes a complete resolution of all the issues submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Med. Ctr., Carswell, Tex.</span>, 64 FLRA 566, 567-68 (2010). Consequently, an arbitration award that postpones the determination of an issue submitted does not constitute a final award subject to review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 567. However, an arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction to assist with the implementation of any awarded remedies does not prevent the award from being final. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep't of Def.

<p class="noindent-1">After concluding that the Agency violated OPM regulations, the Arbitrator remanded the grievant's annual rating to the parties so that the Agency could reevaluate the grievant in accordance with his instructions. Although the Arbitrator retained jurisdiction to "entertain any concerns about compliance," the award contains no indication that the Arbitrator did anything more than retain jurisdiction to assist with implementation of his awarded remedies. Consistent with the foregoing, we find that<span class="Italic"> </span>the award is final and that the exceptions are not interlocutory. Accordingly, we resolve the exceptions.</p>

Where an arbitrator awards particular monetary remedies and leaves to be determined only the specific amounts to be awarded, the arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction to assist the parties in their computations of those remedies does not render exceptions interlocutory. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base, Air Force Materiel Command, Albuquerque, N.M.</span>, 62 FLRA 121, 123 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss and then-Member Pope dissenting in part on other grounds). In addition, it is well established that, under the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations, an arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction for the purpose of considering requests for attorney fees does not automatically render an award non-final. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., Nogales, Ariz.</span>, 47 FLRA 1391, 1392 (1993), <span class="Italic">recons. den. </span>48 FLRA 938 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the remedy award, the Arbitrator determined the remedies and retained jurisdiction only to assist in determining the specific amounts to be awarded to individual employees and to address any future Union request for attorney fees. Consistent with the above-cited precedent, we conclude that the Agency's exceptions are not interlocutory.</p>
<p class="noindent">When the arbitrator decided the merits and directed a remedy (back pay) but left it to the parties to attempt to sort out, through conference or otherwise, the details of the payments, the award was final, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 1302</span>, 64 FLRA 1168, 1169-70 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.11 of the Authority's Regulations provides: "The Authority...ordinarily will not consider interlocutory appeals."

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award resolved all issues submitted to arbitration. Specifically, and as relevant, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency owed "affected" Officers ten minutes of overtime per shift because it violated the FLSA and the parties' agreement. Like <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>the only matters left unresolved are the amount of overtime, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, backpay, and which Officers are entitled to it. <span class="Italic">See IRS, </span>63 FLRA at 159. Thus, the award is final. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(award was final even though arbitrator retained jurisdiction to assist parties in determining the amount of backpay and expenses).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the award is not final because the Arbitrator ordered the parties to meet and determine the appropriate amount of backpay does not lead us to a different conclusion. As the above precedent establishes, an award is final even where the arbitrator retains jurisdiction to assist the parties in determining the proper amount of backpay. <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 63 FLRA at 159.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Trident Refit Facility and IAM Local 2783</span>, 65 FLRA 672, 674 (2011), involving an award of environmental differential pay (and later resolving a dispute between the parties as to the amount of entitlement) explained the distinction between an award that determines a remedy and reserves authority to resolve disputes over calculations (a final award) and an award that leaves the parties the task of sorting out the remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award is considered final for purposes of filing exceptions when it fully resolves all issues submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Wash., D.C., </span>60 FLRA 333, 334 (2004). When an arbitrator orders a remedy but retains jurisdiction to assist the parties in the implementation of that remedy, all submitted issues are considered resolved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, USP Admin. Maximum (ADX), Florence, Colo.</span>, 64 FLRA 1168, 1170 (2010) (award was final where arbitrator ordered backpay in initial award but retained jurisdiction to assist parties in determining the amount of backpay), <span class="Italic">reconsid. denied </span>65 FLRA 76; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 63 FLRA 157, 158-59 (2009) (same). However, where an arbitrator orders the parties to determine the remedy that should be awarded, the award is not considered final. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of HHS, Navajo Area Indian Health Serv.</span>, 58 FLRA 356, 357 (2003) (award was not final because arbitrator declined to issue remedy, and instead directed parties to determine the appropriate remedy); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 1230, 1231-32 (2000) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing precedent establishes that the Arbitrator's Merits Award was final for purposes of filing exceptions. The Arbitrator awarded a remedy of EDP and ordered the parties to determine the specific amount of EDP owed. Thus, the only issue left unresolved by the Merits Award was the amount that the grievants should recover. Because this was the only unresolved issue, the Merits Award constituted a final award for purposes of filing exceptions to it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOJ</span>, 64 FLRA at 1170 (award was final where it awarded a remedy of backpay, but left unresolved the amount of backpay that should be paid to the grievants).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's statement that the Merits Award would not become final until he certified the amount of EDP owed does not alter our conclusion. An arbitrator's characterization of an award does not, by itself, demonstrate whether the award is final. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 355, 357 (2005) (finding that arbitrator's statements in award did not establish whether award was final).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Merits Award was final for purposes of filing exceptions.&#x2003;The Agency, therefore, was required to file any exceptions to that award no later than thirty days after it received the award. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b). The Merits Award was issued and served upon the parties in May 2010. The Agency filed its exceptions with the Authority on October 8, 2010, well beyond the thirty days set forth in &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute. Three of the five Agency's exceptions challenge the Arbitrator's conclusion, in his Merits Award, that the grievants were entitled to EDP.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that, under Authority precedent, where an arbitrator issues a subsequent award that modifies the original award, the time limit for filing exceptions begins upon service of that subsequent award on the excepting party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 131, 132 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). The Agency does not assert that the Remedy Award modified the merits award. Our review of the Remedy Award likewise does not establish that the Arbitrator modified his Merits Award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In the merits award, the Arbitrator resolved the issues submitted: whether the Agency suffered or permitted bargaining-unit employees to work in excess of eight hours per day in violation of the FLSA and the parties' agreement, and if so, what would be the appropriate remedy. The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the FLSA, ordered a remedy, and retained jurisdiction to assist in implementing the remedy. Because the only remaining issue was the amount of the remedy, the merits award constituted a final award for purposes of filing exceptions to that award.[19] And the Union was required to file any exceptions to that award within thirty days after it received the award.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BOP Dublin</span>, 71 FLRA at 1174 (citing <span class="Italic">Pope AFB</span>, 71 FLRA at 339; <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. Citizenship &#x0026; Immigr.

<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1786"></span>Exceptions were timely as to an award that resolved a remedy when the exceptions addressed only the remedy and not the earlier, underlying merits award, in an overtime case, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 66 FLRA 737, 737-39 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the merits award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 18, Section P of the CBA when it failed to: (1) distribute and rotate overtime opportunities fairly and equitably; and (2) retain overtime records for a two-year period. The Arbitrator ordered the parties to meet within thirty calendar days of his decision to determine to whom and in what amount the Agency owed backpay for its violations. He retained jurisdiction to assist the parties with any disputes.<span class="Italic"> </span>When the parties were unable to mutually agree on which employees were due backpay or the amount owed to them, they requested the Arbitrator's assistance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Agency's exceptions challenge the merits award and not the remedy award. As the period for filing exceptions to the merits award expired, the Union asserts that the Agency's exceptions are untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The time limit for filing exceptions to a final arbitration award "is thirty (30) days after the date of service of the award." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.2(b). An award is final when an arbitrator orders backpay, even if the arbitrator directs the parties to meet and determine the appropriate payment of backpay, and retains jurisdiction to assist the parties in resolving any dispute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, USP Admin. Maximum (ADX), Florence, Colo.</span>, 64 FLRA 1168, 1170 (2010), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 65 FLRA 76 (2010). Thus, the merits award is final.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the merits award's finality does not establish that the Agency's exceptions are untimely. The situation here is analogous to when a party seeks clarification of an award, and the arbitrator in rendering the clarification "modifies [the] award so as to give rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div. &#x0026; Portland Dist.</span>, 60 FLRA 595, 596 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>). In such a situation, the filing period begins with service of the modified award. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the question here is whether the remedy award gave rise to the deficiency alleged in the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the remedy award, the Arbitrator found that the Union provided sufficient evidence to determine which employees would have been available for the overtime assignments, and, for the first time, he ordered the Agency to pay a $200,000 lump-sum payment divided equally among the affected employees. In its exceptions, the Agency claims that the lump-sum award is "legally insufficient, speculative, and must be set aside."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the deficiency claimed in the Agency's exceptions--the lump-sum award's legal sufficiency--arises only from the Arbitrator's remedy award, the period for filing exceptions began with service of the remedy award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 60 FLRA at 596. As there is no dispute that the Agency filed its exceptions within thirty days of service of the remedy award, we find that the Agency's exceptions are timely.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award resolved an overtime dispute, directed a remedy, and left resolution of disputes over implementation of the remedy until compliance proceedings. FLRA did not suggest that exceptions to the substance of the award were interlocutory. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 215 and SSA OHA, Falls Church</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-092.html">60 FLRA 461</a> (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB Region 9 and NLRBU</span>, 66 FLRA 456, 458-59 (2012) (interpreting somewhat unclear award to determine the arbitrator resolved grievance and reserved jurisdiction to sort out remedy; exceptions were not interlocutory); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, AFMC Albuquerque and AFGE Local 2263</span>, 62 FLRA 121, 123 (2007) (award was not interlocutory that resolved all issues submitted to arbitration but retained jurisdiction to permit arbitrator to assist parties in computation of remedies directed by award).
