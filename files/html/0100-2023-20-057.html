<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-56"><span class="space">5.</span> Improper Preference, Promotion; 5 USC 2302(b)(6)</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;grant any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for employment (including defining the scope or manner of competition or the requirements for any position) for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302(b)(6), there is no requirement that an unauthorized promotion result in an advantage, only that the purpose be to give an advantage. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DeFord</span>, 28 MSPR 98, 104 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Avery v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 212, 215 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2003) (regulation implementation challenge: 2302(b)(6) could only apply to the employment prospects of an individual, not to a group of people equally affected by the manner that an agency applied OPM veterans preference regulations); <span class="Italic">Weir v. OPM</span>, 62 MSPR 91, 94 (1994) (regulation implementation challenge: 2302(b)(6) is not implicated in regulations creating distinctions among groups of individuals; the statute is violated when the prospects of a specified person are injured or improved by an unauthorized preference). It is not a defense that the responsible official did not know the promotion was improper. Under 5 USC 2302(c), the responsible official has an obligation to ascertain the requirements for a lawful personnel action. <span class="Italic">DeFord</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 28 MSPR at 104 ("Not only did DeFord's manner inhibit opposition, but also it is highly improbable under all the circumstances that DeFord would have listened to or heeded advice that the promotion was improper."). Section 2302(b)(6) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. DHS</span>, 122 Fed. Appx. 476, 479 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Lee,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LEE_RICHARD_F_CB_1215_08_0014_T_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_W_CONCURRENCE_499275.pdf">114 MSPR 57</a>, 60, 65-66, 68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 21, 24, 2010 MSPB 89 (2010) (rev'd as to Diane Beatrez, the second respondent in the <span class="Italic">Lee</span> case, <span class="Italic">sub nom</span> <span class="Italic">Beatrez v. MSPB</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 298 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)), explained the nature of an unwarranted preference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), Board case law requires that the Special Counsel establish an intentional or purposeful taking of a personnel action in such a way as to give a preference to a particular individual for the purposes of improving his prospects. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 561, 570 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 39 F.3d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). This standard is consistent with the plain text of the statute, which specifies that the preference must be given "for the purpose of providing the improper advantage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6). It is the preference itself that is prohibited and not the type of action used in granting the preference. <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 570. In other words, it is possible to violate section 2302(b)(6) using hiring authority and recruitment vehicles that would be acceptable under other circumstances. The Special Counsel bears the burden of proving that a respondent has violated section 2302(b)(6), and the Special Counsel must do so by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the respondents violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) turns on whether they <span class="Italic">intended</span> to afford preferential treatment to Woodson. <span class="Italic">See Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 570.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lee</span> determined that &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) can reach conduct that aids and abets another who is violating that statute, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 32-35:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We acknowledge here that the strongest evidence of intent points not to the respondents, but to CMDR O'Hare. The Special Counsel requested on May 20, 2008, that the Department of Homeland Security impose disciplinary action against CMDR O'Hare, but she retired effective November 30, 2008, before a hearing could be held. Nevertheless, given the rather blatant intention of granting a preference to Woodson that CMDR O'Hare's communications express to the respondents, we also cannot ignore the actions of the respondents, who are HR professionals, in intentionally facilitating an obvious violation of section 2302(b)(6). <span class="Italic">See Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84 (finding that because of respondent Rubenstein's "area of expertise" as a personnelist, "he had the professional responsibility to advise management that using the TLA [(temporary limited appointment authority) to give an improper preference to an applicant for employment] ...was illegal" under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(6) and (b)(11)). We therefore interpret 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) to reach conduct that aids and abets another who is violating the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) here may seem at first glance to conflict with another long-standing tenet of civil service law frequently implicated in insubordination cases. Government employees may not refuse to do work merely because of disagreements with management, and they fail to perform their assigned duties at the risk of being insubordinate. <span class="Italic">Nagel v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 707 F.2d 1384, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Further, the Board has held that an employee does not have the unfettered right to disregard an order merely because there is a substantial reason to believe that the order is not proper; rather, he must first comply with the order and then register his complaint or grievance, except in certain limited circumstances where obedience would place the employee in a clearly dangerous situation, or when complying with the order would cause him irreparable harm. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bowen v. Department of the Navy,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 15 (2009); <span class="Italic">Pedeleose v. Department of Defense,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 508, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 343 Fed. Appx. 605 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 407-08, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). For the subordinate employee, the "obey now, grieve later" doctrine can be a safety net, because the Board has declined to sustain charges of misconduct where the employee has, despite his own misgivings, met his obligation under <span class="Italic">Nagel</span> to perform as directed, and the order he obeyed is found to be an improper one. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Blake v. Department of Justice,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 25 (1999) (holding that one specification of a charge could not be sustained where the appellant's actions underlying the specification had been "taken under the explicit directions of much more highly placed...superiors" at the agency); <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 356, 360 (1985) (holding that the appellant, whose actions were directed by his supervisors, "should not be disciplined in this case because Government employees may not refuse an instruction to do certain work merely because they challenge its propriety"). Indeed, where intent is a relevant consideration in the charge, it should "properly be imputed, not to the appellant, but to the person who issued the order," as it is not the appellant's "responsibility or prerogative to determine the rightness or wrongness" of the order. <span class="Italic">Blake,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts now before us may be distinguished from a typical "obey now, grieve later" situation. There is no evidence that CMDR O'Hare <span class="Italic">ordered</span> the respondents to take actions that would ensure that Woodson appeared on the certificate of eligibles, nor was either respondent one of CMDR O'Hare's subordinates. Instead, the respondents were part of the Coast Guard's headquarters Civilian Personnel Office. Lee was the Command Staff Advisor for the Los Angeles/Long Beach area in the field, and Beatrez, who is now the West Branch Chief and Lee's direct supervisor, was a Washington, D.C.-based HR Specialist in the West Branch at the time. While Lee may have been "the personal point of contact in [the Civilian Personnel Office] with the management officials and employees that he serviced," and "answer[ed] questions from management officials about any issue related to operational personnel," he was nevertheless in the chain of command for the Civilian Personnel Office, as was Beatrez, and not for the Los Angeles REC. As such, neither respondent was a subordinate to CMDR O'Hare. Even if CMDR O'Hare's questions and requests regarding personnel management matters could be construed as orders, the respondents were responsible to a separate organization. Because he was on-site, Lee may have been more susceptible to the influence of local management; however, in his testimony, Kogut repeatedly characterized Lee's role as <span class="Italic">advisory</span>. Kogut testified that Lee "answers questions" and "gives that face-to-face direct contact with" local management. Lee "advised Commander O'Hare and subsequently Commander Hogan on the recruitment process, the hiring process, the announcement process, answered questions from Commander O'Hare with regard to the recruitment process...a typical command staff advisor role." As HR advisors outside of the local chain of command, the respondents should have exercised their independent judgment and challenged local management's fairly obvious efforts to grant a preference to Woodson for the purpose of improving his prospects for selection as the Supervisory Merchant Marine Evaluation Specialist for the Los Angeles REC. <span class="Italic">See Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of our obligation to faithfully uphold the merit system principles as set forth by Congress, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, and to "serve Congress'[s] interest in putting agencies subject to the Civil Service Reform Act...on notice that selections for employment must be made in accordance with law and must not be the result of personal or political favoritism." <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 584. In section 2302(b)(6), Congress set forth the plainest of language prohibiting the granting of a preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment by any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action. Although some may see the respondents as lacking any improper motive or reasonably relying on unquestioned past practices, the Board has spoken before on this issue. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ross,</span> for example, the Board affirmed and adopted as modified the recommended decision sustaining charges that a Personnel Officer and a Personnel Management Specialist engaged in prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4), (5), (6), by manipulating the selection process to place a temporary employee in an open permanent position despite the fact that she was the lowest-ranked candidate on the certificate of eligibles, after management "name-requested" that employee for the position.<span class="Italic"> Special Counsel v. Ross,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 197, 200-03 (1987). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> the Board sustained charges that respondent Rubinstein, a personnelist, had engaged in prohibited personnel practices in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), (11), when he assisted respondent Byrd, the selecting official, in using TLA authority to grant a hiring preference to a politically-connected candidate for a position that was filled under a merit staffing announcement in the hiring at the agency's other locations, because he "should have known that the use of the TLA authority was inappropriate in this case" and "he had the professional responsibility to advise management that using the TLA in this case was illegal." <span class="Italic">Byrd,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. at 577, 583-84. Accordingly, we find that the Special Counsel has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that both respondents violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) when they intentionally assisted CMDR O'Hare in granting an illegal preference for employment to Woodson.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additional definition was provided to the concept of improper preference in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561, 569-70, 577 (1993), involving what the Board considered to be improper use of appointment authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(6), United States Code, Title 5, states that it is a prohibited personnel practice to</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">grant any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for employment (including defining the scope or manner of competition or the requirements for any position) for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, an employee with personnel action authority may give only those preferences authorized by law, rule or regulation. For example, preferences in recruitment and selection are given by Congress to veterans, Indians in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, persons with reemployment rights, handicapped individuals, etc. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, 307, 352, 353, and FPM Chapter 316.4-.7. Ward-Ravenel was not a member of any of these groups and respondents have failed to point to any entitlement to a preference in her case. Thus, the preference given to Ward-Ravenel was not authorized by law, rule, or regulation and was violative of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OSC that the words "not authorized by law, rule or regulation" refer to the preference that is prohibited, not to the type of action used in granting the preference. However, we do not agree with respondents' argument that Ward-Ravenel's preference was "authorized by law" just because the TLA [Temporary Limited Appointment] authority, which respondents used to hire her, is a valid hiring authority. This position is like the suggestion that, because reduction-in-force procedures validly govern separations during a reorganization, using those procedures to discharge an employee for political reasons is also lawful. Although a selecting official does not commit a prohibited personnel practice under this section merely by using a hiring method in good faith that later turns <span id="Page_3733"></span>out to be illegal, it is clear that that same official would indeed violate this section if the purpose in employing that hiring method was to improve or injure a particular person's prospects for employment. That is exactly what happened in this ease.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to find a violation under this section, Board case law requires an intentional or "purposeful taking of a personnel action in such a way as to give a preference to a particular individual for the purposes of improving her prospects for employment." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span> <span class="Italic">Baum v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 13 MSPB 74, 14 MSPR 392, 395 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 727 F.2d 1117 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (Table). The evidence clearly establishes that the intentional actions of respondents Rubinstein and Byrd in using the TLA had no other purpose but to hire Ward-Ravenel. Indeed, we believe the respondents violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) is obvious, because their purpose in using the TLA--to define the scope or manner of competition to enable them to pick Ward-Ravenel for the MPO position--is one of the two examples that the statute gives as violations of that section....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Respondent Rubinstein as a personnelist and Byrd as a selecting official knew or should have known that their use of the TLA authority was improper and was not a legal authority to give a preference to an applicant for employment. Nevertheless, even assuming Rubinstein subjectively believed the position could legitimately be offered as a TLA, the evidence is to the contrary, and use of the TLA was in contravention of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 316.402(a), and therefore unlawful. The conclusion is thus inescapable that the preference given to Ward-Ravenel was illegal by virtue of this use of the TLA which was not authorized by law, rule, or regulation. Rubinstein's subjective belief that the TLA was legally used would be germane only in deciding what penalty was warranted for the legal violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Coffman</span>, 124 MSPR 130, ___&#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21, 51, 54-55, 2017 MSPB 3 (2017), emphasized intent to create a preference, along proof of that intent, when the respondent was charged with improperly manipulating competitive civil service application packages with knowledge that the actions were intended to convert noncareer political appointees to career appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), the Board requires that the Special Counsel establish an intentional or purposeful taking of a personnel action in such a way as to give a preference to a particular individual for the purposes of improving his prospects. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 561, 570 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). This standard is consistent with the plain text of the statute, which specifies that the preference must be given "for the purpose of" providing the improper advantage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6). Thus, whether the respondent violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) turns on whether she <span class="Italic">intended</span> to afford preferential treatment to the three applicants in question. <span class="Italic">See Byrd</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 590. It is not the respondent's actions themselves that violate the law, but instead, the intent behind those actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Special Counsel bears the burden of proving that the respondent has violated section 2302(b)(6) by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Cummings</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 625, 632 (1984); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we state up front that, while the respondent's actions amounted to possible error or negligence, we find that they did not rise to the level of intentionally committing an unlawful hiring practice. Likewise, our decision in this matter does not resolve whether illegal hiring practices did or did not happen. They may have, but the Special Counsel failed to prove that the respondent's actions showed that she intentionally granted an unlawful hiring preference in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Special Counsel that an individual need not be a "mastermind" of the prohibited activity to violate 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6). Nevertheless, as set forth above, the ALJ correctly required the Special Counsel to prove that the respondent intended to grant an authorized preference when she certified the competitive application packages of the three applicants at issue and engaged in other acts related to Applicant A's Schedule A application. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Byrd</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 590. The ALJ did not require the Special Counsel to prove that the respondent was the "mastermind" of the prohibited activity, but merely included in his analysis testimony from J.N. that <span class="Italic">he</span> did not see a lot of evidence that the respondent was the "mastermind of this thing." Despite the Special Counsel's contention that the respondent admitted during testimony that she acted voluntarily and on her own in certifying the competitive applications, this testimony merely reflects the respondent's belief that no one pressured her or told her to sign the certifications, she was accountable and responsible for certifying the packages, and she should have reviewed them more carefully than she did. Such testimony does not demonstrate that the respondent intended to grant an unauthorized preference or advantage, and is consistent with the ALJ's findings regarding C.G.'s apparently suspicious role in the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel's arguments in this case are primarily based upon circumstantial evidence. Proper circumstantial evidence can be relied upon to establish intent. <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 526, 546 (1981). The Board may infer intent when the strength of the evidence warrants such an inference. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, conclusions as to subjective intent may not be based on mere surmise or speculation as to what plausibly could have occurred, and an unlawful intent "is not lightly to be inferred." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the circumstantial and any other evidence relied upon by the Special Counsel is not sufficiently strong to warrant an inference that the respondent intended to grant a preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation when she took any of the actions at issue in this case. Most of the evidence identified by the Special Counsel addresses whether and when the respondent knew, in general terms, that certain individuals within the CBP were interested in hiring the three applicants at issue. By contrast, as the ALJ found, there is little, if any, evidence in the record to show the respondent was aware of any improper actions taken by the IHC in preparing the application packages that she ultimately certified, or knowledge on her part that using the Schedule A authority to hire Applicant A was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nichols</span>, 36 MSPR 445 (1988), considered the circumstances constituting violations of 5 USC 2302(b)(6), prohibiting grants of unauthorized preferences or advantages in personnel actions, based on an allegation that the respondent hired a friend into a position to enable the friend to compete for another position that could only be filled with a candidate already employed by the agency. Legitimate reasons existed for the hiring action. No prohibited personnel practice was found. However, the purposeful and improper classification of a position for purposes of placement of an employee constituted a prohibited personnel practice, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 61 MSPR 559, 570-72 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count five charged respondent Nelson with violating 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) (1988) by giving Brown a preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule or regulation, when she caused the title and series of the GM-201-14 personnel officer position to be changed to a GM-301-14 resource manager position for the purpose of improving Brown's chances for appointment to the position. The statute requires a showing that preferential action was taken for the purpose of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, improving the prospects of a particular person for employment and that the preference was unauthorized by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561 at 570 (1993). The CALJ concluded that OSC established the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. We agree....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nelson challenges the CALJ's finding of an unauthorized preference as improperly relying, in part, on the addition of law enforcement duties to the resource manager position description prior to Brown's appointment. We need not decide whether the law enforcement duties were added before or after Brown's appointment because other evidence clearly shows that Nelson misclassified this position in order to improve Brown's chances for appointment to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CALJ found that the reclassification was improper based on the testimony of John Fitzpatrick, OPM supervisory personnel management specialist, and his own comparison of the position classification standards for series 201 and 301 and the duties of the resource manager position. This comparison showed that the duties of the position description matched the duties in the position classification standard for series 201 and that series 301 was therefore inapplicable because it applies only to positions that "involve specialized work for which no appropriate occupational series has been established."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the issue of Nelson's knowledge of the improper classification, the CALJ found that Sandra Scott, the personnel management specialist, told Nelson in person, and by memo, that the resource manager position could not be classified in the 301 series. The CALJ noted Scott's possible bias against Nelson for an earlier admonishment and her involvement in an earlier misclassification action. He also noted Nelson's denial which he termed "less than emphatic," as well as Nelson's claim that she would not be involved in a misclassification because she had been hired to "clean up a mess" created by a misclassified position. The CALJ, however, found Scott more credible than Nelson because her testimony was corroborated by three other INS and former INS employees.... His conclusions included a detailed response to Nelson's attack on the credibility of Scott, Thompson, and Naughton.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the CALJ's finding that Nelson changed the classification of the former personnel officer position to advantage Brown. The CALJ found that Nelson, "impressed by Brown's performance during his detail to the Southern Region [of INS], reclassified and fashioned the position for his advantage in order that his services might be retained." He noted that Brown would not have qualified for the resource manager position if it had remained classified in the 201 series. He also found...that Nelson directed Cornett to rate Brown qualified. The ranking panel <span id="Page_3734"></span>then relied on Cornett's determination that Brown's experience on detail qualified him for the resource manager position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-12-0312-I-1 (NP 4/26/2013), described an improper preference that led to adverse action under an "unbecoming conduct" charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-14 position of Supervisory Human Relations Specialist based on the charge of conduct unbecoming a federal employee. Specifically, the agency charged that the appellant sent an e-mail to three GS-9 employees outlining a 3-step plan to get them promoted to GS-12. The plan detailed how the appellant wrote the GS-12 position description, would rewrite the employees' resumes to match the upgraded position, and would announce the positions using the GS-12 position description that the appellant wrote as a template. In selecting the removal penalty, the agency relied on the appellant's prior disciplinary record, a written reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency proved the charge. She found that the appellant's actions, rewriting his subordinates' resumes, would have provided them with preferential treatment or an unfair, unauthorized, and improper advantage in subsequent selections for the vacancies....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation of work assignment and unauthorized preferences is briefly touched on in a few Board decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peterson v.
