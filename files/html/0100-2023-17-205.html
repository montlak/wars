<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-203"><span class="space">l.</span> Disqualification of Selectee From Further Consideration; Limitations on Selecting Official, Panel</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Armament Research, Dev. and Eng'g Ctr., Picatinny Arsenal and NFFE Local 1437</span>, 48 FLRA 873, 879-83 (1993), presents an example of an award that lawfully directed an agency to preclude consideration of the selectee during the rerun of a challenged promotion. The decision also noted that the arbitrator preserved (or did not interfere with) management's right to determine not to fill the position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find an award deficient when it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation. For the following reasons, we find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award is deficient and we will deny the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that, by ordering the Agency to remove the selected employee from the disputed position, the award is inconsistent with FPM chapter 335, Appendix A. The provisions of FPM chapter 335 govern promotion and internal placement. Appendix A authorizes the retention of an incumbent employee pending action to correct a procedural violation, but only if certain conditions are satisfied. Specifically, under section A-4(b)(1)(b) of Appendix A, an employee may be retained in a position only if reconstruction of the promotion action demonstrates that the employee could have been selected had the proper procedures been followed at the time of the selection action or if the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) office with geographic jurisdiction approves the retention. The Authority consistently has held that where an arbitrator determines that an agency violated proper procedures in filling a vacant position, the incumbent employee is entitled to be retained in the position pending the corrective action unless it is specifically determined by the arbitrator that the incumbent originally could not have been properly selected....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had violated the merit promotion requirement of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and an Agency regulation. The Arbitrator specifically determined that the selected employee was not qualified for the GS-13 position and, therefore, "could not have been included among the best[-]qualified candidates referred to the [s]electing [o]fficial," because the employee did not possess all of the KSAs established for the position. This determination constitutes a finding by the Arbitrator that the employee originally could not have been selected for the position. Thus, there was no basis under the applicable requirements set forth in FPM chapter 335, Appendix A, on which to retain the selected employee in the position. Consequently, the Agency has failed to establish that the award is deficient as contrary to FPM chapter 335, Appendix A, and this exception is denied. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">New York State Council of the Association of Civilian Technicians and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, New York State Department of Military and Naval Affairs</span>, 46 FLRA 66, 71-73 (1992) (<span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau</span>) (Authority modified award to require the removal of an employee who, at the time of the selection action, did not meet the qualification requirements for the disputed position and could not have been properly selected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(1) and (2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 4.3. The Authority has held that merit system principles are hortatory and are not self-executing and that to establish a finding of a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), a party must show that: (1) the disputed personnel action violated law, rule, or regulation; and (2) the law, rule, or regulation implements or directly concerns merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-78 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Martinsburg, West Virginia</span>, 46 FLRA 631, 636-37 (1992) (union failed to establish that award was deficient under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) because there was no showing that agency had committed a prohibited personnel practice). The Agency fails to show that the Arbitrator has violated merit system principles in any way by preventing the selectee from applying for the GS-13 position. As noted previously, the Arbitrator clearly found that the selectee was not <span id="page_2053"></span>qualified for the position under the KSAs established for the position by the Agency. The award precluding the selectee from being considered in the rerunning of the selection action is consistent with the finding that the selectee was not qualified for the announced position and in no way treats the selectee unfairly or inequitably....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find no merit in the Agency's exception that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, Requirement 4, because it interferes with the Agency's right to select from any appropriate source. We construe the Agency's exception as also contending that the award is contrary to management's right to select employees under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both section 7106(a)(2)(C) and FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, Requirement 4, provide that management has the right in filling positions to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. When an arbitrator is not enforcing a contractual arrangement, management's right to make selections for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when the arbitrator finds a direct connection between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select a specific employee for promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 242</span>, 45 FLRA 437, 443 (1992). In this case, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency should have selected a specific employee. Rather, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had violated merit promotion provisions in its agreement and regulation and, as a consequence, had improperly selected an unqualified employee for the position. The selectee was not a properly ranked and certified candidate for selection by the Agency and, therefore, could not have been selected. Consequently, we conclude that the Arbitrator's award does not interfere with the Agency's right to select employees under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute and FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1-4, Requirement 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find no basis for the Agency's contention that the award is deficient because it limits management's right to select from any available source by limiting management to considering only internal candidates in rerunning the promotion action. We have held that an arbitrator cannot limit an agency's right to select by ordering the agency to make a selection from a specific list of candidates and precluding the agency from making a selection from any available source. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Houston, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1633</span>, 32 FLRA 997, 1001-02 (1988). However, the award in this case does not limit the Agency's right to select in that manner. Rather, the award merely orders the rerunning of the promotion action in accordance with the conditions and requirements that the Agency established and applied in the initial promotion action. Further, the award permits the Agency to consider additional candidates properly found to be qualified for the position. The only restrictions imposed by the Arbitrator are the requirements that the original selectee cannot be considered because he is not qualified for the position and that the employees who originally made the highly-qualified lists be considered. We find nothing in the award in this regard that interferes with the Agency's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because it requires the Agency to establish and fill a position that it no longer desires to fill, we note that the Agency did make a selection for a Chemical Engineer, GS-13 position. The Agency has provided no basis for finding the award deficient with regard to the reannouncement of that position. Consequently, if the Agency intends to retain and fill the position and reannounce a vacancy for that position, then the Agency must comply with the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, if the Agency has abolished the original Chemical Engineer, GS-13 position and does not intend to fill the position, we find nothing in the award that specifically requires the Agency to rerun the promotion action. Stated differently, we construe the award as requiring the Agency to rerun the promotion action only if the Agency determines to fill the same position that was originally announced. We find that, under the award, the Agency is free to elect not to fill the original GS-13 position....</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award was sustained that directed a rerun and exclusion of prior competitors, <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA and NAGE Local R14-52</span>, 56 FLRA 637, 642-43 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has made it clear that an award that orders an agency to rerun a selection action for a particular position affects management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Chicago North District Office and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1346</span>, 56 FLRA 274, 277 (2000) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago</span>). Moreover, the Authority has stated that management's right to select includes the right to determine the qualifications, skills, and abilities needed to perform the work of a position and to determine whether applicants possess such qualifications, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Newport News, VA and National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-2</span>, 56 FLRA 339, 343 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>Is Satisfied</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, with regard to prong I, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the selection requirements contained in Article XXV, Section 6 of the CBA. In order to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BEP, Washington, D.C. and NTEU, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997)], the award must provide a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that if management retains the right to determine the qualifications for assignment of work and whether individual employees possess such qualifications, then the procedure by which one of the qualified employees is assigned such work is negotiable under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. For example, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Dover Air Force Base, 436th Air Lift Wing, Dover, Delaware and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1709</span>, 55 FLRA 935 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Dover Air Force Base</span>). A provision in that case, as interpreted by the arbitrator, provided the agency the right to determine the requisite qualifications necessary to perform the particular work at issue, but required the agency to use the negotiated procedure to select. The Authority stated that such a provision was "clearly in keeping with Authority precedent under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 939.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator enforced Article XXV, which mandates that "Employees selected must meet the requirements of the prospective assignment." The Arbitrator found that the employee selected was not qualified, and that the Grievant was qualified. This is similar to the arbitrator's determination in <span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot</span> that the agency's assignment of work to one employee over another based on the agency's assessment of their relative qualifications was incorrect under the CBA. In that case, the arbitrator was enforcing a provision that required equitable rotation among qualified employees, which provision was found by the Authority to be a section 7106(b)(2) procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 524-25. Likewise, in this case, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA and his finding that the Agency violated it demonstrate that the Arbitrator was enforcing a provision in the parties' agreement that constitutes a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Dover Air Force Base</span>, 55 FLRA at 939. Thus, prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> has been satisfied. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>: the Award Is A Proper Reconstruction</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II, the question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy is a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the CBA. Here, as in <span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago</span>, the Arbitrator did not order that the Grievant be retroactively promoted. Instead, he directed that the selection process be rerun, using the same criteria as used at the time the Selectee was chosen. Ordering an agency to redo a selection action so as to accord with contractual requirements is an action satisfying prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. <span class="Italic">SSA, Chicago</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 215, AFL-CIO</span>, 54 FLRA 1365, 1373 (1998) (prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> is satisfied when an arbitrator orders a rerun of a selection that did not conform to law or a CBA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question remains as to whether the Arbitrator's order that Employee M and the Selectee not be considered undermines the reconstruction requirement of prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. The Arbitrator excluded the two because the Selectee was not qualified, and Employee M had turned down the appointment during the selection that is being reconstructed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's task under prong II is to examine whether the award reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had it complied with the contract provision. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. Management decided to select noncompetitively, thus requiring it to comply with Article XXV Section 6 of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Selectee's exclusion from the rerun selection is consistent with a reconstruction under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. The CBA requirement, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, is that the selection be made from employees who meet the requirements of the assignment at the time of selection. The Authority, like the Federal courts, will accord an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement substantial deference. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 4052, Council of Prison Locals and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Metropolitan Detention Center, Guaynabo, San Juan, Puerto Rico</span>, 56 FLRA 414, 417 (2000); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Oxon Hill, Maryland and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 65</span>, 56 FLRA 292, 298 (2000). The Selectee was determined by the Arbitrator not to be qualified, a factual determination to which we defer. <span class="Italic">See NFFE Local 1437</span>. Because the CBA required that the selection be on a rotational basis from employees who meet the requirements of the assignment, the exclusion of the Selectee from consideration is proper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that Employee M's exclusion from the rerun selection is consistent with a reconstruction under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. Since <span class="Italic">BEP</span> requires that a reconstruction represent what management would have done had it complied with the contract provision, the rerun should properly <span id="page_2054"></span>exclude Employee M as well. She removed herself during the original selection and the Agency moved forward to select another candidate. Eliminating her from consideration in the rerun puts the Grievant, and the selection process, in the same position as would have obtained but for the Agency's violation of the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding and NAGE Local R4-2</span>, 56 FLRA 339, 343-44 (2000) (before arbitrator could direct reconstitution of selection panel and reweighing of selection criteria, it was necessary for arbitrator to identify law or a contract provision that management violated in first promotion action).</p>
<p class="noindent">Conditions imposed on a rerun, including a bar to the selection of the original selectee, were reviewed and generally found acceptable by FLRA, with the exception that the arbitrator could not preclude the selecting officials whose selection action was set aside from participating in the rerun of that action, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, 50 FLRA 88, 92-94 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in this connection, we reject the Agency's assertion that the award abrogates its right to select by barring selection of the selectee. The award neither precludes the selection of any particular individual nor requires that any particular candidate be chosen.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's construction of the award as interfering with its right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute to decide not to fill the position. We construe the award as not requiring the Agency to rerun the selection action if it decides not to fill the position. We conclude, therefore, that the Agency has not shown that the award is deficient on this basis. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1437</span>, 48 FLRA 873, 882-83 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument regarding the portion of the award requiring it to conduct interviews also does not demonstrate that the award is deficient. The Agency does not specify how its management rights are violated by a requirement that, if it chooses to rerun the selection action, it interview certain candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we resolve the Agency's exception to the portion of the award which prevents the selecting official from participating in the rerun of the selection action by determining whether it directly interferes with a management right under section 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and International Federation of Professional and Schedulers Union, Planners, Estimators, Progressmen and Schedulers Union, Local 2</span>, 49 FLRA 1363, 1367 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>).[6] In this regard, an agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) includes the right to determine the employees to whom work will be assigned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368. Awards directly interfering with that right are deficient as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In barring the Agency from designating the previous selecting official from participating in a rerun action, the award prevents the Agency from determining what duties will be assigned to a particular individual and, thereby, interferes with the Agency's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 779 (1992) (proposal barring agency from assigning certain officials to serve on ranking panels directly interfered with right to assign work) and <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board Union and National Labor Relations Board</span>, 42 FLRA 1305, 1308-09 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to</span> <span class="Italic">other matters sub nom. National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (proposal preventing agency from designating certain officials to serve as reviewing officials for performance appraisal purposes directly interfered with right to assign work). As such, this portion of the award is deficient because it is contrary to law, and we modify the award to delete it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;As nothing in the award indicates that the Arbitrator was enforcing a contractual arrangement, the abrogation test set forth in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990)] does not apply here. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span> at 1367-68. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2369 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA 124, 132 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Social Security</span> <span class="Italic">Administration</span>) (exceptions to award barring particular supervisor from reappraising grievant's performance denied where award constituted enforcement of contractual arrangement requiring agency to apply performance standards in a fair and equitable manner).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA v. AFGE, Local 3627</span>, 58 FLRA 739, 742-43 (2003), also precluded an arbitrator from disqualifying a selecting official from participating in a rerun of the selection process, but for reasons different than those in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award violates &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute by requiring the Agency to use a selecting official from outside the regional office. In support, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 50 FLRA 88. In <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, the Authority set aside a portion of an award barring a selecting official from participating in a rerunning of the selection action on the basis that such an award interfered with the agency's right to assign work<span class="Italic">. See </span>50 FLRA at 93-94.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, the Authority established a framework for resolving claims that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Upon finding that an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under Prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Under Prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. An award that fails to satisfy either Prong I or Prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate<span class="Italic">. Soc. Sec. Admin., Boston Reg. (Reg. 1), Lowell Dist. Office, Lowell, Mass.</span>, 57 FLRA 264, 269 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The portion of the award directing the Agency to appoint a different selecting official affects the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., NLRB</span>, 50 FLRA at 93-94. Assuming, without deciding, that this portion of the award satisfies Prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, we find that it fails to satisfy Prong II because it does not reflect a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In directing the Agency to appoint a different selecting official, the Arbitrator found that such an order would "avoid even the appearance of impropriety or predetermination in the third selection process[.]" However, the Arbitrator made no finding, and there is no record evidence, that the parties' agreement or any law, rule or regulation requires the Agency to use a different selecting official when rerunning a selection action. Thus, there is no showing that the Agency would have designated a different selecting official had the Agency not violated the parties' agreement. In rerunning the selection action, the Agency retains the authority to appoint any selecting official it chooses, consistent with its right to assign work under the Statute.</p>
