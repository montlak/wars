<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-56"><span class="space">a.</span> SES Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Special statutory considerations apply to reassignments of members of the Senior Executive Service (SES). Under 5 USC 7543(a) and OPM regulations, an agency may remove an SES member for failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function. The Board touched on the issues arising from an appeal involving a reassignment in <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 31 MSPR 571 (1986), but provided no extensive statutory or regulatory analysis. <span class="Italic">Brennan</span> determined that the appellant's concern about financial hardship resulting from reassignment to the field, coupled with his belief that he could better serve the agency is his current position, did not justify his refusal to accept a directed reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 317.901 (2022). [Refer to Chapter 6 for actions involving "<a href="0100-2023-08-142.html#sec1-141">Senior Executive Service</a>" members.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board addressed reassignment of SES employees with rigor in <span class="Italic">Shenwick v. Dept. of State</span>, 92 MSPR 289, 291-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18 (2002), involving a discharge that resulted from the appellant's failure to report for a reassignment and that, in turn, resulted in a whistleblower reprisal defense. <span class="Italic">Shenwick</span> determined that, consistent with the design of the Senior Executive Service as a mobile group of executives, the agency's initial burden is only to demonstrate that the employee was qualified for the job involved in the reassignment. The employee must then articulate an improper basis for the reassignment, e.g., a prohibited personnel practice. The appellant bears the burden of proving the affirmative defense by preponderant evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a career SES appointee, was employed as an SES-Level 4 Counselor, United Nations (UN) Resources Management in New York City. She filed a timely individual right of action (IRA) appeal alleging that the agency had: (1) failed to renominate her to the UN Advisory Committee of Administrative and Budgetary Questions; (2) rated her performance as "Unsatisfactory" for the 1996 rating period; and (3) reassigned her from her position in New York City to the position of Director, Office of Acquisitions, Bureau of Administration, in Washington, D.C. She contended that the agency's actions constituted reprisal for protected disclosures in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); discrimination based on her political affiliation or perceived political affiliation in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(E); a violation of the merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(8); a violation of the merit system principles contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9); and a violation of her right to petition Congress under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7211....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 9, 2000, the agency issued a decision removing the appellant from her reassigned position in Washington, D.C., effective November 27, 2000. The agency based the removal action on charges of failure to accept a directed reassignment from her SES position in New York City to the SES position in Washington, D.C.; and misconduct (absence without official leave for over 2,000 hours between June 29, 1999, and September 1, 2000, and disobeying three orders to report to work)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the legitimacy of a removal action taken against an employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)]. In a Board appeal from a chapter 75 adverse-action,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee puts the agency in the position of plaintiff bearing the burden of first coming forward with evidence to establish the fact of misconduct, the burden of proof, and the ultimate burden of persuasion, with respect to the basis for the charge or charges. The employee (while denominated appellant) has the advantageous evidentiary position of a defendant with respect to that aspect of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2), "the agency's decision may not be sustained [by the Board]...if the employee or applicant for employment...(B) shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)." The employee bears the burden of establishing that the decision was based on any such prohibited personnel practice<span class="Italic">. See Anderson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 9 MSPB 164, 9 M.S.P.R. 536, 539 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2504"></span>If an adverse action is based on an employee's failure to accept a directed reassignment, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its decision to reassign the employee was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, and based upon legitimate management reasons<span class="Italic">. Umshler</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 630. Evidence showing that its reasons for ordering the reassignment were legitimate, together with evidence showing that the appellant was given adequate notice of the reassignment decision and that she refused to accept the reassignment, is sufficient to establish the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden then shifts to the employee to present rebuttal evidence, although the ultimate burden of proof never shifts from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the employee can show that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire, or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 MSPB 459, 2 M.S.P.R. at 298-99, the Board held that the agency must show that its decision to reassign an employee was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based upon legitimate management considerations in the interests of the service. The Board stated that "an agency discretion to reassign may no more properly be invoked as a veil to effect an employee's separation than may a reduction in force." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at n.8. Thus, the Board's general review of a directed reassignment action is to assure that it is used for legitimate reasons and therefore its focus is on the legitimacy of the reasons for the reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The burdens of proof applicable to directed reassignments of SES members.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Umshler/Ketterer</span> line of cases involved non-SES civil service employees who were removed pursuant to the "efficiency of the service" standard mandated by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. The Board has not previously considered the question of whether that is the standard applicable to the removal of an SES employee for failure to accept a directed reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA or statute), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified, as amended, in various sections of 5 U.S.C.), reveals that Congress intended the SES to be a mobile corps of managers who may be expeditiously reassigned to meet shifting agency priorities. S. Rep. 95-969, at 11 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2733; <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. 95-1403, at 10 (1978) ("Employees in the SES will be subject to...reassignment to meet agency needs."). In <span class="Italic">Mintzmyer v. Babbitt</span>, No. CIV. A. 93-0773 (GK), 1995 WL 25342, at *3 (D.D.C. Jan. 12, 1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 72 F.3d 920 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (Table), that court noted that the "SES...provides greater authority to agencies in managing their organizations including the ability to assign executives where they would be most effective in accomplishing the agency's mission." In <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 5 MSPB 101, 5 M.S.P.R. 19, 22-23 (1981), the Board, in discussing the legislative history of the CSRA, noted that the legislative history evidenced an intent that "members of the Senior Executive Service be subject to fewer protections than non-SES members in order to add management flexibility to the top echelons of the federal government." The Board also noted that "Congress designed the SES for the express purpose of increasing flexibility in the staffing of the top management of government agencies." To that end, we believe that Congress did not require agencies to justify the reassignment of SES employees unless an employee claims that the agency reassigned him for an improper reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute specifically addresses the matter of the reassignment of career SES appointees. It provides that "[a] career appointee in an agency...may...be reassigned to any Senior Executive Service position in the same agency for which the appointee is qualified...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3395(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 317.901(b). The statute further provides that the career appointee must have received written notice of the reassignment at least 15 days prior to its effective date. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3395(a)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 317.901(b)(1). Before a career appointee may be reassigned outside of her commuting area, however, the agency must consult with her "on the reasons for, and the appointee's preferences with respect to, the proposed reassignment...," and, following the consultation, she must receive "written notice of the reassignment, including a statement of the reasons for the reassignment,..." at least 60 days before its effective date. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3395(2)(B)(i); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 317.901(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An SES member who fails to accept a directed reassignment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3395(a)(1)(A) may be removed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7543. The CSRA originally provided that SES employees, like civil service employees, could be removed "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" under section 7543(a). In a 1981 amendment to the CSRA, Congress substituted "misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance" for the "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" standard. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. No. 97-35, &#x00A7; 1704(d)(2), 1981 U.S.C.C.A.N. (95 Stat.) 357, 758. Then, in 1984, Congress amended this standard further to allow removal also for "failure to accept a directed reassignment or to accompany a position in a transfer of function." Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984--Performance Management and Recognition System, Pub. L. No. 98-615, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. (98 Stat.) 3195, 3218<span class="Italic">. See also Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (court referenced sections 7541-7543 concerning SES employees as an example of Congress' ability to limit the coverage of chapter 75 removal procedures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, section 7543(a) does not apply the efficiency of the service standard to SES disciplinary actions, but enumerates particular causes for discipline<span class="Italic">. Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 843. Therefore, in contrast to adverse actions taken against non-SES employees for failure to accept a directed reassignment, the agency is not required to demonstrate before the Board that an SES employee's removal promotes the efficiency of the service in order to support its removal action. Consequently, the agency need not demonstrate that its decision to reassign an SES employee was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based on legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service in order to support its removal of an SES employee for refusing a reassignment. Rather, the agency must only prove that it removed the employee for a cause authorized by section 7543(a), one of which is failure to accept a directed reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the burden of proof appropriate to general-schedule employees removed for failure to accept a directed reassignment under the <span class="Italic">Umshler/Ketterer</span> line of cases is not appropriate to SES members based on legislative intent, the purpose of the SES, and the specific standards for reassignment and removal of SES members. We find, as ruled by the AJ, that the initial burden of proof is for the agency to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the SES member was qualified for the reassignment, as required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3395(a)(1)(A). If the appellant is unable to articulate an improper reason for the reassignment, she has no basis to challenge her removal<span class="Italic">. See Brennan v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 571, 575 (1986) (SES employee's belief that he would suffer financial hardship due to geographic reassignment and that he could better serve the agency in his current position did not justify his refusal to accept a legitimate reassignment). Further, where the appellant alleges that the agency action was based on a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), the appellant bears the burden of proof with respect to this affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7543(b), the Board hears appeals filed by career SES employees disciplined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7543(a) under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, which provides that, even in cases where the agency has supported its decision by the applicable standard of proof, the decision may not be sustained if the employee "shows that the decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B). Section 2302 of Title 5 of the U.S. Code, which enumerates the prohibited personnel practices of the CSRA, includes among "covered positions," with respect to a personnel action, "...a career appointee position in the Senior Executive Service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B). Among the personnel actions identified in this section is "an action under chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). Thus, even if the agency establishes by preponderant evidence that the appellant was qualified for the position to which the agency reassigned her, the Board may not sustain an adverse action based on her failure to accept the directed reassignment if the appellant establishes by preponderant evidence that the agency's action was based on any of the prohibited personnel practices described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(iii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(C)] (the appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, with respect to affirmative defenses).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant argued below that <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 600-01, supports application of the <span class="Italic">Umshler/Ketterer</span> burden of proof applicable to general-schedule employees to removals of SES members for failure to accept a directed reassignment<span class="Italic">. Harper</span> involved the dismissal of an SES employee's appeal from an alleged involuntary retirement as untimely filed. In resolving that case, the Board did not address the specific issue raised by this appeal. However, the Board stated, "When (as here) a retirement involves the agency's use of this discretionary reassignment authority, an appellant may raise the issue of the voluntariness of the retirement by alleging that the reassignment had no 'solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle.'" <span class="Italic">Harper</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 601. The two cases the Board relied on in support of this proposition, <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Administration</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 667 (1993), and <span class="Italic">Rayfield v. U.S. Department of Agriculture</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 244 (1985), both involved non-SES employees, and the Board in <span class="Italic">Harper</span> did not explain why the standard applied in <span class="Italic">Caveney</span> and <span class="Italic">Rayfield</span>, which arose from the efficiency of the service standard, should govern SES disciplinary actions to which the efficiency of the service standard does not apply. Thus, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Harper</span> can be interpreted as providing that the burden of proof applicable to adverse actions taken against non-SES employees for <span id="Page_2505"></span>failure to accept a directed reassignment also applies to adverse actions taken against SES employees, it is hereby overruled.</p>
