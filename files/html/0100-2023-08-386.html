<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-378"><span class="space">13.</span> Damages, Other Benefits</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Donahue v. VA</span>, PH-3330-17-0167-I-1 (NP 7/20/2022), summarized relief available, and limitations on that relief, in a denial of competition appeal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under VEOA, a prevailing party is entitled to the following relief: (1) agency compliance with the statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference that the agency violated; (2) compensation for lost wages or benefits that resulted from the violation; and (3) attorney fees, expert witness fees, and litigation expenses. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c. Further, if the violation was willful and the appellant is entitled to lost wages and benefits, he also is entitled to receive liquidated damages equal to lost wages and benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the above, the Board has recognized that if an agency violated an appellant's right to compete, that appellant is not automatically entitled to the position sought; rather, he is entitled to a selection process consistent with law. <span class="Italic">Washburn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 265, &#x00B6; 13 (2013). If an appellant is selected during the reconstructed hiring process, the agency must pay lost wages and benefits. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-21 (2016), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 711 F. App'x 624 (Fed. Cir. 2017). If the agency must pay lost wages and benefits, it also may be required to pay liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record does not show whether the appellant has been selected for the Budget Analyst position as a result of a properly reconstructed hiring process, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the request for damages is premature. <span class="Italic">See Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 369, &#x00B6; 14 (2011) (recognizing that an agency's obligation to comply with an appellant's veterans' preference rights is an ongoing obligation; damages cannot be determined until after the issue of an individual's entitlement to a position has been decided).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Proceedings to assess damages are conducted under 5 CFR 1201.201 (2022). [Refer to Chapter 16, "Damages Under VEOA, USERRA."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The loss of wages is a condition precedent to recovery of liquidated damages under VEOA, <span class="Italic">Cheathem v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-3330-15-0027-P-2 (NP 9/15/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provision regarding damages states: "[i]f the Merit Systems Protection Board...determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board...shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved. If the Board...determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25(a) (containing virtually identical language).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the appellant did not suffer any lost wages or benefits as a result of the agency's VEOA violation because he was not selected for the position during the reconstructed hiring process. On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge improperly determined that the agency's actions were not willful without allowing discovery or holding a hearing. However, the Board has held that for an appellant to prevail on his request for liquidated damages under VEOA, he must prove that he is entitled to an award of lost wages or benefits because the statutory language provides no means of awarding liquidated damages absent an award of lost wages or benefits. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 12 (2011), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 14 (2016); <span class="Italic">see also Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 369, &#x00B6; 14 (2011). Thus, to the extent the administrative judge failed to provide the appellant an opportunity to prove the agency's actions were willful, any error does not provide a basis for reversal. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (stating that an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA provides for liquidated damages, but those damages are available only for willful violations of that statute. Under <span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 107 MSPR 142, 145-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13, 2007 MSPB 259 (2007), if the agency reasonably relied on the law as it stood at the time it took the action, and the action was permissible under then extant law, the agency's VEOA violation was not willful:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We GRANT the agency's cross petition for review, however, to address an issue of first impression for the Board regarding the standard to be applied in determining whether an agency's denial of an appellant's right to veterans' preference was a "willful" violation of veterans' preference rules. VEOA's remedial provision states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Merit Systems Protection Board...determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board...shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved. <span class="Italic">If the Board...determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The subsection of the statute that defines its terms does not define "willful." Furthermore, the legislative history of the section sheds no light on Congressional intent. Moreover, neither the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit nor any other federal court has explicitly defined the word "willful" as it is used in this subsection. <span class="Italic">But see Pena v. Harvey</span>, Civil Action No. 02-CV-01459-WDM-MJW, 2006 WL 2164483 (D. Colo. July 31, 2006) (district court found a VEOA violation was not "willful," without defining the term, because the selecting official relied upon the advice of an agency personnel specialist that veterans' preference did not apply to the appointment). A fundamental canon of statutory construction is that, in the absence of a statutory definition or clear guidance in the legislative history, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning. <span class="Italic">See Perrin v. United States,</span> 444 U.S. 37, 42 (1979); <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 263 F.3d 1341, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"In common usage, the word 'willful' is considered synonymous with such words as 'voluntary,' 'deliberate,' and 'intentional.'" <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co.,</span> 486 U.S. 128, 133 (1988) (citing Roget's International Thesaurus &#x00A7; 622.7, p. 479; &#x00A7; 653.9, p. 501 (4th ed. 1977)). In addition, the requirement that a violation be "willful" has long been a requirement in a number of different statutes. It is considered a word of many meanings, and its construction is often influenced by its context. <span class="Italic">Screws v. United States</span>, 325 U.S. 91, 101 (1945). For example, in determining the required element of intent in criminal law, an offense may be considered "willful" only if the individual "voluntarily" and "intentionally" violated a "known legal duty." <span class="Italic">Cheek v. United States</span>, 498 U.S. 192, 200 (1991) (discussing the element of "willfulness" in criminal prohibitions against tax evasion). On the other hand, the courts have interpreted a number of civil and administrative statutes to put a slightly different gloss on the requirement to find a violation "willful." For example, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 621, 626(b), has a very similar provision to the one at issue here that provides for the award of liquidated damages for <span id="Page_745"></span>willful violations of the Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that such a violation is "willful" if the "employer either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by the ADEA." <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</span> 469 U.S. 111, 128 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also McLaughlin,</span> 486 U.S. at 133 (adopting <span class="Italic">Thurston</span> for all willful violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 201-219, to include violations of the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 206(d)(3)). In adopting this definition of "willful," the Court identified this test as the "reckless disregard" standard. <span class="Italic">Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. at 126.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that VEOA is a remedial statute. The general principle is that remedial statutes should be construed broadly in favor of those whom it was intended to protect, and to suppress the evil and advance the remedy of the legislation. <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 17 (2007); <span class="Italic">Dean,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 19. Given the purpose of VEOA and the definition for "willful" used in similar remedial statutes, such as the ADEA and the Equal Pay Act, we believe that the <span class="Italic">Thurston</span> "reckless disregard" standard is the most reasonable interpretation of the statute. We therefore find that the "reckless disregard" standard should be applied to determinations of whether violations of VEOA are "willful" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this standard to the instant appeal, we find that the agency's violation of veterans' preference rules was not "willful." The undisputed facts show that agency management official, Mark Fredenberg, District Manager, Montana Field Office, learned in late November 2004 that he would need to fill two vacancies in his office. Fredenberg testified that he contacted Personnel Specialist Joseph L. Eitel, concerning the various hiring authorities available to fill the positions. After their conversation, Fredenberg testified that he decided to use the Outstanding Scholar program to fill the vacancies. Further, although Eitel later informed Fredenberg that he should also announce the positions in a competitive vacancy announcement, the record shows that Eitel did not inform Fredenberg that he must use the competitive examination process to fill the positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its cross petition for review, the agency argues that a finding of reckless disregard of the appellant's veterans' preference rights is unwarranted because the Outstanding Scholar Program was a valid and authorized hiring authority at the time it made the selections in this case. It therefore contends that it believed in good faith that the appointments under the program were a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> exception to the requirement to use the competitive appointment process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. The Outstanding Scholar Program was authorized by a consent decree in <span class="Italic">Luevano v. Campbell,</span> 93 F.R.D. 68 (1981). <span class="Italic">See Dean,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-29. In the 24 years between the approval of the decree and the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, which was 6 months after the selections at issue in this case, no binding authority ever held that using the program's appointing authority violated veterans' preference rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the non-competitive appointment of a non-preference eligible under the Outstanding Scholar Program was expressly authorized by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidance in effect when Fredenberg recommended the appointments in this case.<span class="Italic"> See Dean</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 34 (discussing the 2003 edition of OPM's <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook</span>). Further, notwithstanding Fredenberg's agreement to issue an open competitive announcement, there is no evidence that he did not genuinely believe that he still had the discretion to recommend the Outstanding Scholar applicants for appointment instead of recommending selections from the competitive certificate of eligibles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 17 (2001), <span class="Italic">vacated,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 293 (2003), <span class="Italic">vacated,</span> 429 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2005), OPM expressly argued that hiring officials possess precisely the kind of discretion exercised by Fredenberg in this case. It was not until Dean that the Board rejected OPM's contention. Thus, the evidence does not support a finding that Fredenberg's violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights was knowing and intentional, or that it was made with reckless disregard for the appellant's rights. <span class="Italic">See Kolstad v. American Dental Association,</span> 527 U.S. 526, 536-37 (1999) (the reckless disregard standard is not met in cases where the employer reasonably believes that its discrimination under Title VII satisfies a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> exception to liability). Accordingly, we REVERSE the ID's finding that the agency's violation of veterans' preference rules was willful.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that VEOA is a remedial statute and, as such, should be "construed broadly in favor of those whom it was intended to protect, and to suppress the evil and advance the remedy of the legislation." <span class="Italic">Weed v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Merit Systems Protection Board (in a proceeding under section 3330a)...determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board...shall order the agency to comply with such provisions and award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved. If the Board...determines that such violation was willful, it shall award an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.25(a) (containing virtually identical language). The first sentence thus provides for an award for any loss of wages or benefits suffered as a result of an agency's violation of an individual's veterans' preference rights, while the second sentence provides an award of backpay,[4] as liquidated damages, when the violation is willful. However, this provision does not explain how to calculate an award of liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The term "backpay" in the context of a VEOA appeal is not to be construed to have the same meaning as the term of art "back pay" under the Back Pay Act, because VEOA appeals are not governed by the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our statute is similar to other labor and employment statutes that provide for an award of liquidated damages, and we look to those statutes for guidance. For example, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) applicable to the private sector,[5] and the provisions of USERRA applicable to the states and the private sector, all permit an award of liquidated damages, and each concludes that liquidated damages is in addition to an award of non-liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 216(b), 260, 626(b), 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(d)(1)(C). In fact, these other statutes provide an explicit means for calculating an award of liquidated damages, namely that the amount of liquidated damages awarded is <span class="Italic">equal to an additional award of non-liquidated damages</span>.[6] 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 216(b), 626(b), 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I), 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii); 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(d)(1)(B)-(C<span class="Italic">); cf. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston</span>, 469 U.S. 111, 125-26 (1985) (double damages under the ADEA); <span class="Italic">Bankston v. State of Illinois</span>, 60 F.3d 1249, 1254 (7th Cir. 1995) ("The FLSA presumptively authorizes the district court to award liquidated double damages against employers who violate the FLSA.") (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">Traxler v. Multnomah County</span>, 596 F.3d 1007, 1015 (9th Cir. 2010) (double damages under FMLA); <span class="Italic">Serricchio v. Wachovia Securities, LLC</span>, 606 F. Supp.2d 256, 265 (D. Conn. 2009) (double damages under USERRA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The provisions of FMLA applicable to the federal government do not provide for liquidated damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6381-6387.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The ADEA provides that liquidated damages are payable only in cases of willful violations and are to be calculated in the same manner as under the FLSA, which in turn provides for unpaid minimum wages or unpaid overtime compensation and "an additional equal amount as liquidated damages." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 216(b), 626(b). USERRA states that liquidated damages for a willful violation are to be awarded in an amount equal to the amount of lost wages or benefits awarded. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323(d)(1)(B)-(C). The FMLA provides for an award of liquidated damages in "an additional amount...equal to the sum of" any wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost by reason of the violation, except that an employer may escape liability for liquidated damages if it shows that its actions were taken in good faith and the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that its actions did not violate FMLA. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2617(a)(1)(A)(i)(I), 2617(a)(1)(A)(iii). Like FMLA, the FLSA, as amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act, allows employers to escape liability for liquidated damages upon a showing of good faith and reasonable grounds to believe that its actions did not violate FLSA. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provisions of the FLSA, ADEA, USERRA and FMLA discussed above are different than our VEOA damages provision because these statutes use consistent terms and directly relate an award of liquidated damages to a calculation of non-liquidated damages. The VEOA damages provision, by contrast, uses two different terms to describe an award of non-liquidated damages and liquidated damages, lost wages or benefits, and backpay, respectively. We have reviewed the legislative history of VEOA and we could not find any explanation to account for this difference in terminology.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any legislative guidance, and given the similarities between VEOA and the other labor and employment statutes like the FLRA, ADEA, USERRA and FMLA, we adopt the construction of these statutes, and we hold that the term "backpay," for an award of liquidated damages under VEOA, is equal to an additional award of non-liquidated damages ("lost wages or benefits"). In other words, we find that our VEOA statute provides for an award of lost wages or benefits for an ordinary violation and an additional amount, equal to the award of lost wages or benefits, for a willful violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the appellant to prevail on his request for liquidated damages under VEOA, however, he must prove, among other things, that he is <span id="Page_746"></span>entitled to an award of lost wages or benefits, for our interpretation of the statute contains no means of awarding liquidated damages in the absence of an award of lost wages or benefits<span class="Italic">. Cf. Greene v. Safeway Stores, Inc.</span>, 210 F.3d 1237, 1245-46 (10th Cir. 2000) (jury award of unrealized stock option appreciation in an ADEA case was not unpaid wages or unpaid overtime compensation and therefore was not subject to doubling as liquidated damages); <span class="Italic">Persky v. Cendant Corporation</span>, 547 F. Supp.2d 152, 164-66 (D. Conn. 2008) (liquidated damages are directly based on a plaintiff's economic damages). We therefore proceed to an analysis of his entitlement to lost wages or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's entitlement to an award of lost wages or benefits.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3330c(a) provides that, when the Board "determines that an agency has violated a right described in section 3330a, the Board...shall...award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved." An award for lost wages or benefits thus includes two requirements, that the agency must have violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights, and that the appellant must have lost wages or benefits as a result of the violation. The first requirement has been met here, as the Board has twice found that the agency violated the appellant's preference rights. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 9. Where, as here, the agency conceded that it would have selected the appellant but for its violation of his veterans' preference rights, the second requirement also may have been met if the appellant suffered lost wages or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's previous decisions specifically forwarded the appellant's claims for lost wages, benefits and liquidated damages to the regional office for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. at 357. However, as noted by the appellant on petition for review, the administrative judge did not discuss the appellant's claim for lost wages and benefits in the initial decision. This was error. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify and resolve all material issues of fact and law). Therefore, remand is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court recently provided guidance on the proper parameters for an award of lost wages or benefits under such circumstances. In <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, 587 F.3d at 1318, the Federal Circuit held that "Mr. Marshall is entitled to the lost wages or benefits pursuant to &#x00A7; 3330c from the June 2004 selection date that violated his veterans' preference rights until such time as he is placed in the position at issue or declines the position at issue."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal is unusual because the agency argued below that, once it learned of <span class="Italic">Dean</span> and the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) suspension of its use of the OSP, "it immediately went into negotiations with Appellant to settle the case and make him whole[,] subject to any requirements and offsets." Indeed, the parties do not dispute that such offers were made and declined, with the appellant contending that the agency's offers were inadequate.[7] After the Board ordered the agency to reconstruct the selection process for a second time, the agency selected the appellant for the GS-7 Contract Specialist position and, on March 11, 2009, it offered him that position, but the appellant declined the offer. <span class="Italic">See</span> X-1 File, Tab 4 at 2 (the agency's offer of the Contract Specialist GS-1102-07 target GS-11 position, which noted that his start date would be "no later than 11 May 2009," and that, if he successfully completed the required training and career assessment boards, he could be eligible for promotion to the GS-9 and GS-11 levels), Tab 5 at 3 ("I recommend we wait until the (MSPB) [sic] render[s] their decisions in each one of my appeals, or the Air Force and I discuss settlement with the Administrative Judge who will render the decision in my appeals."). As discussed above, the Board previously found that the agency's 2009 offer complied with its prior Opinion and Orders.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;For instance, on June 20, 2007, the agency sent correspondence to the appellant, confirming that an offer regarding the GS-7 Contract Specialist position was issued two weeks earlier and that the offer included backpay and the "normal increases [he] would have received during the period [he] did not work and while [he was] on military duty." On August 30, 2007, the agency indicated that the appellant had not responded to the offer. In an October 19, 2007 letter, the agency confirmed the appellant's declination of the job offer and training start date. On October 23, 2007, the appellant sent a letter to the agency, stating that he did not agree to the agency's settlement offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While <span class="Italic">Marshall</span> directs that the appellant's claim for lost wages or benefits properly terminates when he declined the agency's offer, this appeal presents unique circumstances and, as a result, we do not believe that it is appropriate to use the agency's 2007 offer as the end point for an award of lost wages or benefits. Although we did not have the benefit of the court's guidance in <span class="Italic">Marshall</span> when we first ordered the agency to reconstruct the selection process, the fact remains that the agency's failure to properly reconstruct the selection process following the Board's April 15, 2008 reconstruction order constituted an ongoing VEOA violation based on the law that was in effect at the time. We therefore find that the appellant's entitlement to lost wages or benefits, if any, extends from the date of the agency's original 2005 nonselection until March 11, 2009, when the agency offered the appellant the GS-7 Contract Specialist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his calculation of damages on remand, we expect that the administrative judge will make findings regarding several outstanding issues, including when, if at all, the appellant would have been entitled to grade, step and/or pay increases after the retroactive starting date. The administrative judge shall also instruct the appellant to provide records of his income, if any, and his efforts to obtain other employment during the relevant time period, as well as proof of any relevant expenses that should be offset in an award of lost wages or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge correctly found that the agency's violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights during the initial selection process was not willful.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the appellant to prevail on his request for liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a), he must prove that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights and that the violation was willful. With respect to the September 2005 nonselection, this first element is satisfied because we already concluded that the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights when it used the OSP during the original selection process. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 3; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 9. As to the second element, the Board has held that a violation is willful, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a), when the agency either knew or showed reckless disregard for whether its conduct was prohibited. <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency claimed that, at the time that it made the selections, around September 13, 2005, <span class="Italic">see Williams,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 567, &#x00B6; 2, it was unaware of the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision, which had been issued a few weeks earlier, on August 5, 2005. In fact, the agency claimed that it did not know of the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision, or its implications, until January 3, 2006, when OPM first informed agencies that it was temporarily suspending its use of the OSP hiring authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record supports the agency's assertion that it did not know of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Dean</span>, or the impact of this decision on its use of the OSP, at the time of the appellant's original nonselection. The agency provided evidence that, on December 23, 2005, the Department of Defense issued a Memorandum to military agencies, including the Department of the Air Force, indicating that in light of the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision, OPM was temporarily suspending its use of the Outstanding Scholar appointment authority and OPM was advising each agency to determine its own appropriate course of action in regard to that decision. In response to OPM's direction, the Department of Defense indicated that it was also suspending its use of the Outstanding Scholar appointing authority. This Memorandum was sent, via e-mail, to the military agencies on approximately January 3, 2006. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3-4. We agree with the administrative judge that, because the agency did not know about the <span class="Italic">Dean</span> decision, or its implications on the propriety of the OSP, its failure to select the appellant in September 2005 was not a willful violation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). Thus, the appellant is not entitled to an award of liquidated damages for this violation of his veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">There is a question as to whether the agency willfully violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights after the Board ordered it to reconstruct the selection process in April 2008, and thus, whether the appellant is entitled to an award of liquidated damages.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is unusual because the agency stipulated that it would have hired the appellant but for its improper use of the OSP, we gave the agency an opportunity to remedy its original violation when we directed it to reconstruct the selection process for the GS-7 Contract Specialist position, consistent with the appellant's veterans' preference rights, on April 15, 2008, but the agency's first reconstructed selection process was not proper. Rather, it was only after we issued a second reconstruction order that the agency properly reconstructed the selection process, selected the appellant for the GS-7 Contract Specialist position and offered him that position.[8] Below, the administrative judge did not analyze the appellant's request for liquidated damages after the Board's first reconstruction order, nor did he question the agency regarding the outcome of the first reconstructed selection process, considering its prior stipulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We do not view the agency's failure to select the appellant <span class="Italic">per se</span> as a VEOA violation, but rather, its failure to properly reconstruct the selection process, consistent with our prior Opinion and Orders and the law in effect at the time, is the ongoing VEOA violation for which we are concerned. We base our rulings in this appeal on the Board's statutory authority to remedy violations of any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c, and not on the Board's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2) to enforce compliance with Board orders and decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of these issues is critical to a determination of whether the agency's violation of the appellant's veterans' preference rights, after <span id="Page_747"></span>our April 15, 2008 reconstruction order and up until March 11, 2009, was willful. For instance, the agency's obligation to comply with the appellant's veterans' preference rights did not end at the time of the original nonselection, but rather, it was an ongoing obligation, and thus, it is appropriate for the administrative judge to consider this subsequent timeframe in his analysis of willfulness. Moreover, the outcome of the agency's first reconstructed selection process appears to conflict with its prior stipulation, and thus, this conflict may be evidence of the agency's intent to willfully violate the appellant's veterans' preference rights. Conversely, the agency's 2007 offer to the appellant may be evidence of its intent to comply with the appellant's veterans' preference rights, and would warrant against a finding of willfulness, notwithstanding the appellant's apparent dissatisfaction with the terms of that offer. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate to remand this issue to the administrative judge so that he may take evidence and argument and make findings regarding the agency's willfulness during this time frame.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the AJ awarded Mr. Williams wages and liquidated damages. His PFR challenging the assessment of damages was denied, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-3443-06-0118-B-1 (NP 10/26/2012). The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. 608, 609-11 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2005, Williams applied to the Department of the Air Force ("Air Force") for the position of Contract Specialist, GS-1102-07, target GS-11 (the "GS-7 position"). <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 407 Fed. Appx. 421, 422 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Although he was a ten-point preference eligible veteran, Williams was not selected for the position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Williams was subsequently called up to active duty in Iraq in January 2006, and served until February 2007. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams filed a complaint alleging that the Air Force had violated his veterans' preference rights under the VEOA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 422. In June 2007, the Air Force stipulated that the selection process it had used to fill the GS-7 position in 2005 was improper, and that Williams should have been selected. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 2008 M.S.P.B. 91, &#x00B6; 3. After protracted proceedings, the agency offered Williams the GS-7 position on March 11, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 2011 M.S.P.B. 19, &#x00B6; 5. Williams rejected the offer, however, contending that he was entitled to be hired at a higher grade level. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 407 Fed. Appx. at 422. The Board then dismissed Williams's claim for employment as moot in view of Williams's refusal to accept the GS-7 job offer. The Board remanded the question of Williams's entitlement to compensation for lost wages and benefits. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 356, 357 (M.S.P.B. 2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In November 2011, pursuant to the remand, the administrative judge ("AJ") issued an initial decision awarding Williams lost wages and benefits from November 14, 2005 (the date on which the individuals selected in place of Williams began working) through March 11, 2009 (the date on which the agency offered him the GS-7 position). <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, No. AT-3443-06-0118-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 7, 2011) (initial decision). To determine the amount of lost wages, the AJ constructed a hypothetical employment history. Because Williams was called to active duty in the middle of the period of hypothetical employment, the AJ was obligated to take into account when constructing this history the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 ("USERRA"), 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-35, which requires that a returning veteran be treated comparably with coworkers who remained continuously employed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Williams would have begun his employment in November 2005 at GS-7, he would have been eligible for promotion to GS-9 after working for 52 weeks at GS-7 and completing 1,696 hours of training, and eligible for further promotion to GS-11 after 52 weeks at GS-9 and another 1,696 hours of training. The AJ assumed that Williams would have completed his training-hours requirement as promptly as possible while at the agency. The AJ apparently found that Williams could not have received the necessary training while away on active duty from January 2006 to February 2007. The AJ therefore concluded that Williams would have been eligible for promotion to GS-9 in December 2007, after one year of working at the agency, and eligible for further promotion in January or February of 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams sought review before the Board, challenging both the sufficiency of the March 2009 job offer and the AJ's calculation of damages, and the Board denied his petition. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, Nos. AT-3443-06-0118-B-1, AT-3443-06-0118-C-2 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 26, 2012) (final order). Williams then appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams first challenges the Board's determination that the Air Force's March 2009 offer of the GS-7 position mooted his claim for future employment. Williams asserts that he "was entitled to the GS-11...position [in March 2009 and] not the GS-7...position." He bases his argument on an alleged "discrepancy" between the job offer and the back pay award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that if the Board "determines that an agency has violated a [preference] right..., the Board...<span class="Italic">shall order the agency to comply with [the preference]</span> <span class="Italic"> provisions</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a) (emphasis added). We have held under different facts that "the appropriate remedy [for a VEOA violation] is for [the veteran] to be placed <span class="Italic">in the job for which he applied.</span>" <span class="Italic">Marshall</span>, 587 F.3d at 1317 (emphasis added). In this case, there is no dispute that the only "job for which [Williams] applied" was the GS-7 position. We see no error in the Board's mootness determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams also asserts that in calculating his back pay award, the Board failed to take into account his rights under USERRA with regard to his period of active duty service during the hypothetical back pay period. In particular, he asserts that the Board erred by failing to count that thirteen-month period towards the training-hours requirement for promotion to GS-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides that a returning veteran who has been absent for more than 90 days is entitled to be reemployed "in the position of employment in which the person would have been employed if the [veteran's] continuous employment...had not been interrupted..., or a position of like seniority, status and pay, the duties of which the person is qualified to perform." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(A). The Supreme Court has interpreted the predecessor to USERRA as entitling a veteran to a so called "escalator" promotion only if the promotion "'depend[s] simply on seniority,'" and not on "'fitness and ability and the exercise of a discriminating managerial choice.'" <span class="Italic">Tilton v. Mo. Pac. R.R. Co</span>., 376 U.S. 169, 179 (1964) (quoting <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Mo.-Kan.-Tex. R.R. Co</span>., 357 U.S. 265 (1958)); <span class="Italic">see also Leite v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 2008 M.S.P.B. 141, &#x00B6; 10 (applying <span class="Italic">Tilton</span> to a USERRA claim).In other words, the veteran must demonstrate with "reasonable certainty...that he would have enjoyed advancement" at the earlier time. <span class="Italic">Tilton</span>, 376 U.S. at 180; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.191. The principle that the veteran is only entitled to receive an "escalator" promotion if he or she is qualified for the new position is reinforced by subsection 4313(a)(2)(B) of USERRA, which allows the employer to place the returning veteran in his or her original position "if the [veteran] is not qualified to perform the duties of [the escalator position] after reasonable efforts by the employer to qualify the [veteran]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to become eligible for each successive promotion, Williams would have needed to complete successfully 1,696 hours of training, consisting of "a combination of 'on the job' training and classroom training." <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, No. AT-3443-06-0118-B-1, slip op. at 3 &#x0026; n.1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 7, 2011). This training-hours requirement was "independent" of the time-in-grade requirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4. Because the promotion to GS-9 depended on successful completion of this training requirement, independent of the time-in-grade requirement, Williams has not demonstrated that, had he been hired and had he not been called to active duty, he would have received the promotion to GS-9 in November 2006 based "'simply on seniority.'" <span class="Italic">See Tilton</span>, 376 U.S. at 179. Furthermore, Williams has not refuted the agency's showing that he could not have been "qualified to perform the duties of" the GS-9 position, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4313(a)(2)(B), until he completed his training requirement, or that it would have taken him about 44 weeks longer to complete that training requirement after his return from active duty.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Williams cites section 4316(a) of title 38, which provides that a returning veteran is "entitled to the seniority and other rights and benefits determined by seniority that the [veteran] had on the date of the commencement of [military] service...plus the additional seniority and rights and benefits that [the veteran] would have attained if [he or she] had remained continuously employed." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(a). Since his appeal concerns promotions, rather than seniority or "rights and benefits determined by seniority," section 4313 is the relevant section in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence therefore supports the Board's conclusion, for purposes of calculating a back pay award, that Williams would have been entitled to a promotion to GS-9 in December 2007, and to a subsequent promotion to GS-11 in January or February of 2009.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In continuing compliance litigation, the Board denied achievement and performance-based awards, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-3443-06-0118-X-2 (NP 12/16/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notable achievement and performance-based time off awards (which the agency states were given some employees), unlike overtime or night work, are highly variable and depend on the individual's performance. Because the appellant never actually worked in the position at issue, or in any other position with the agency, it is purely speculative to assume he would have earned a notable achievement or time off award. Moreover, even if we required the agency to grant him the average of the awards given to other employees, as is commonly done when calculating overtime, he would derive no monetary benefit. Notable achievement and time off awards are not cash awards, nor can they be converted to cash. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.104(f) (a time off award "shall not be converted to a cash payment under any circumstances").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[A] determination of the amount of liquidated damages owed to an individual because of the agency's willful violation of VEOA cannot be determined until the issue of the individual's entitlement to a position has been decided and the right to lost wages or benefits established. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). This is so because the remedy for a willful VEOA violation is liquidated damages equal to the amount of lost wages or benefits. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). The agency's obligation to comply with the appellant's veterans' preference rights is an ongoing obligation. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 22. Thus, while the agency's original violation was not willful because of its good-faith reliance on the Outstanding Scholars Program, <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20; <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 142 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2007), it is possible that the agency's actions could become willful if it fails to meet its ongoing obligation. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21. This cannot be resolved, however, until the agency has come into compliance with the Board's order.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that, contrary to the administrative judge's decision to award him wages but not benefits, he is entitled to "full <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, make-whole relief" because numerous Board decisions, including <span class="Italic">Lodge v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 22 (2007), and <span class="Italic">Dow v. General Services Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 369 (2011), hold that an aggrieved veteran need only sustain either a loss of wages or a loss of benefits to be entitled to <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> make-whole relief. He asserts that a footnote in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 1 n.1, suggesting that a prevailing appellant is entitled to either wages <span class="Italic">or</span> benefits, is <span class="Italic">dicta</span> and should be overruled if it is not dicta because it is inconsistent with legislative intent and analogous remedial statutes. The appellant contends that the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have construed the statutory term "loss of wages or benefits" to be synonymous with "back pay and benefits," and that any ambiguity in the remedial statute must be resolved in favor of the veterans that the statute is intended to protect. He also contends that a House Committee Report prepared when VEOA was under review indicates that a prevailing individual is entitled to "make-whole" relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 682, &#x00B6; 9 (2006). As relevant here, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a), if the Board determines that an agency has violated VEOA, it "shall...award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, relying on <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 1 n.1, ruled that the above statutory language only permits an award of lost wages <span class="Italic">or</span> lost benefits, and awarded only lost wages in this case. However, we note that the word "or" in statutes and regulations is sometimes ambiguous because it is subject to two different meanings, one disjunctive and one conjunctive. <span class="blue"><span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of State</span></span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 514, 518 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">see Maibaum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 10 n.2 (2011) (holding that the word "or" has both an inclusive sense ("A or B [or both] ") and an exclusive sense ("A or B [but not both] ")). Thus, "or" may be interpreted to mean "and" if "more consistent with the legal intent." 1A Norman Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction &#x00A7; 21:14 (7th ed. 2007); <span class="Italic">see Willis v. United States</span>, 719 F.2d 608, 612 (2d Cir. 1983)3 (observing that "or" can mean "and," depending on the context).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the phrase "any loss of wages or benefits" in section 3330c(a) requires the Board to award compensation for both wages <span class="Italic">and</span> benefits if both of those types of losses have been incurred. It is well settled that "the word 'any' has an expansive meaning, that is, 'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind.'" <span class="Italic">United States v. Gonzales</span>, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997) (citation omitted). When Congress does not add any language limiting its scope, "any 'must' be read 'as referring to all' of the type to which it refers." <span class="Italic">Tula-Rubio v. Lynch</span>, 787 F.3d 288, 293 (5th Cir. 2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Gonzales</span>, 520 U.S. at 5). Here, reading the phrase as a whole, we find that the Board is required to compensate an appellant for all types of losses that fall within the categories of wages or benefits. In fact, a Board decision and some language in a court decision issued after <span class="Italic">Williams</span> have suggested that both wages and benefits may be recovered in a VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Dow</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 369, &#x00B6; 15 (ordering an agency to pay the appellant back pay and benefits); <span class="Italic">see also Marshall</span>, 587 F.3d at 1317 (finding that a veteran was entitled to receive the difference "between the pay and benefits" he actually earned in his lower-grade Federal position and those he would have earned had an agency not violated his VEOA rights by failing to select him for a higher-grade position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation is consistent with VEOA's purpose of assisting veterans in obtaining Federal employment. <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 841 (Fed. Cir. 2007). VEOA "is an expression of gratitude by the [F]ederal government to the men and women who have risked their lives in defense of the United States." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has recognized that VEOA is a remedial statute and, as such, should be construed broadly in favor of those whom it was intended to protect, and to suppress the evil and advance the remedy of the legislation. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 8. We find that interpreting section 3330c(a) as requiring the Board to award compensation for any loss of wages and benefits serves to advance the gainful employment of veterans and the enforcement of the rights set forth in VEOA. <span class="Italic">See Swentek v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 605, 614 (1997) (observing that it is the Board's task to interpret the words of a statute in light of the purpose Congress sought to serve). By contrast, a more narrow interpretation would, in essence, reward an agency that had violated the dictates of VEOA by permitting it to escape the payment of either wages or benefits, thus placing it in a better position than it would have been in had it complied with the statute from the outset.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in its discussion of the section of the bill that addresses the language at issue in this case, a U.S. House of Representatives Committee Report provides that "[a]n individual who prevails is entitled to 'make-whole' relief." H.R. Rep. No. 105-40, pt. 1, at 18 (1997). When this reference is read in conjunction with the statutory requirement that the Board award compensation for "any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved," it is clear that an award of compensation for the loss of both wages <span class="Italic">and</span> benefits comes closer to making the individual whole than an award of compensation for the loss of either wages or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other statutes with language similar to that set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a) have been interpreted as requiring an award of lost wages and benefits. The Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act (VRRA), which was the predecessor statute to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), <span class="Italic">see Searcy v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2010), provided that a court could "compensate [the person entitled to the benefits of the VRRA] for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by reason of such employer's unlawful action," <span class="Italic">Novak v. Mackintosh</span>, 937 F. Supp. 873, 883 (D.S.D. 1996). Damages under the VRRA were "calculated as back wages and other benefits which the veteran would have received had she been reemployed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the remedial provisions of USERRA also provide "for any loss of wages or benefits." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). The Board has interpreted the language of this provision as entitling an appellant to lost wages and benefits as a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Erickson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 17 (2013); <span class="Italic">Randall v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 12 (2007) (finding that the appellant may be entitled to "lost wages and benefits" if the agency violated USERRA); <span class="Italic">Lee v.

Special Counsel</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 172, &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 328 F.3d 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Here, therefore, we find that the phrase "any loss of wages or benefits," which was construed in analogous earlier statutes, such as the VRRA and USERRA, as meaning any loss of wages <span class="Italic">and</span> benefits, is presumed to have the same meaning in VEOA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 1 n.1, the Board reminded the parties and the administrative judge that VEOA "only permits an award of lost wages <span class="Italic">or</span> benefits" (emphasis supplied). The administrative judge relied upon the footnote in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> in adjudicating this case. Nevertheless, we find that the language in the <span class="Italic">Williams</span> footnote is an incidental or collateral opinion that was not essential to the disposition of the case, <span class="Italic">see Smith v. Orr</span>, 855 F.2d 1544, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (holding that a court is not bound by general expressions of opinion that were not essential to the disposition of prior cases), and includes no analysis supporting its interpretation of section 3330c(a). There is not, for example, any analysis of the context of the language in question, nor is there any mention of the legislative history of VEOA or the Board's interpretation of the comparable VRRA and USERRA provisions. In addition, there is no mention in the <span class="Italic">Williams</span> footnote of a prior Board decision in <span class="Italic">Lodge</span>, a VEOA appeal, in which the Board held that an individual may be entitled to the remedies of back pay and compensation for loss of benefits if it is determined that he would have been hired by the agency in the absence of a violation of his rights. 107 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 15. Accordingly, based on the above analysis, we overrule the footnote in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> to the extent that it is inconsistent with this decision and find that the appellant is entitled to be compensated for any loss of wages and benefits he suffered from September 5, 2006, until October 17, 2012.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant asserts on review that the Board should award him lost wages and benefits through March 29, 2013, when the agency conceded that he would have been entitled to the positions at issue but for its violating his veterans' preference rights. We agree, however, with the administrative judge's determination that the award period ends on October 17, 2012, when the appellant declined the agency's job offer. <span class="Italic">See Marshall</span>, 587 F.3d at 1312, 1318 (finding a veteran entitled to lost wages or benefits from the date of the selection that violated his veterans' preference rights until he was placed in, or declined, the position at issue).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the scope of those benefits, the appellant seeks Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) service credit and Social Security credit for any period of service at issue in this case. The VEOA statute does not define the term "benefits." <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a-3330c. However, the term "benefit" is defined in USERRA broadly to include "privileges of employment," such as "rights and benefits under a pension plan." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2). As set forth above, Congress enacted USERRA before it enacted VEOA, and they are similar remedial statutes. Thus, we construe the term "benefit" to have the same meaning in the two statutes. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant is entitled to lost wages and "benefits" as that term is defined at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2), including CSRS service credit and Social Security credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White v. VA</span>, DA-3330-15-0044-P-2, n.5 (NP 2/24/2023), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA statute does not define the term "benefits." <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a-3330c. However, the term "benefit" is defined broadly in USERRA to include "privileges of employment," such as, among other things, rights and benefits under a pension plan, awards, and bonuses. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2); <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 21. Because Congress enacted USERRA before it enacted VEOA and because they are similar remedial statutes, the Board construes the term "benefit" to have the same meaning in the two statutes. <span class="Italic">Weed</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 71, &#x00B6; 21. Accordingly, we find that the appellant is entitled "benefits" as that term is defined at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA did not extend to a claim pertaining to credit for military service when calculating an employee's annual leave accrual rate for a period that the appellant was simultaneously a federal employee and on military leave from the Air Force, <span class="Italic">Alford v. DOD</span>, 113 MSPR 263, 268 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 32 (2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Alford v. DOD</span>, 407 Fed. Appx. 458 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the statutory provision at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6303, which sets forth the rate at which a civil service employee accrues annual leave based on his years of service, does not stand in some relation to, have a bearing on, concern, and have a connection with veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-16 (2006) (finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), which affords preference eligible veterans the right to compete for a vacancy open to internal and external candidates, is a statute "relating to veterans' preference"). The fact that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6303 sets forth the circumstances in which a retired member of the military may, for purposes of accruing annual leave as a civilian federal employee, receive credit for his active duty military service does not render this statutory provision as relating to, bearing on, concerning, or having a connection with veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Simpkins</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-21 (dismissing the appellant's VEOA appeal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because the FERS statutory and regulatory provisions regarding the payment of interest for veterans who make deposits for post-1956 military service do not stand in some relation to, have a bearing on, concern, and have a connection to veterans' preference rights). Thus, even if, as the appellant contends, the agency erred in processing his annual leave accrual rate for the period during which he was a federal employee and on terminal leave from the military, he has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under VEOA because he cannot prove that the agency's action violates a statute or regulation relating to, bearing on, concerning, or having a connection to veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lewis-Mozejko v. DHHS</span>, DE-3330-21-0185-I-1 (NP 4/19/2023), found no VEOA or other source of Board jurisdiction to review what appellant contended was an incorrect characterization of her veterans preference status on an SF-50 in her OPF. The appellant did not assert that she was denied any opportunity to compete for a position. There was no allegation that the coding on the form related to any personnel action or impacted appellant's wages or benefits. After extensive discussion of statutes relating to veterans preference, the Board concluded: "Nothing in this Final Order is intended to prevent the appellant from filing a request to amend her SF-50 under the Privacy Act, according to the procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(d)(2)."
