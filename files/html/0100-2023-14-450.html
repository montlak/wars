<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-451"><span class="space">8.</span> Bureau of Engraving and Printing</h4>
<p class="noindent">Pay rates for Bureau of Engraving employees were partially negotiable, pursuant to a statutory provision that requires the agency to set pay rates as nearly as possible, consistent with the public interest, with comparable wage rates. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5342(a)(1)(I) and 5 USC 5349(a). <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 121 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 25 FLRA 1082, 1085-87 (1987), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing v. FLRA</span>, 838 F.2d 1341 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (following <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1409 (3d Cir. 1988)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2135 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 43 FLRA 1202, 1206-09, 1213-20 (1992) (negotiable: proposals concerning pay rates and procedures for collection and evaluation <span id="page_950"></span>of wage rate data). The D.C. Circuit questioned the result, however, in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving</span> and returned the case to FLRA for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d 301, 302-04 (D.C. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In March 1991 unions representing six bargaining units at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing submitted a variety of negotiating proposals to the Bureau and announced that they sought to negotiate the "method by which wage rates of their respective crafts are set, adjusted and maintained insofar as permitted by law." The Bureau promptly responded that it would not bargain over the proposals, invoking both the "management rights" exception of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) and the exception for matters "specifically provided for" by statute. The unions appealed to the FLRA, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E) &#x0026; 7117(c), which found the unions' proposals negotiable. <span class="Italic">IAM, Franklin Lodge No. 2135, et al. v. Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, (<span class="Italic">"FLRA Decision"</span>), 43 FLRA 1202 (1992). The Bureau now appeals to this court, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7123(a) &#x0026; (b), relying only on the "specifically provided for" exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute governing the wages of Bureau employees, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5349(a), uses a two-factor formula that looks to the "prevailing rates" of similar private-sector employees and to the demands of the "public interest":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The pay of employees...in [various agencies, including the Bureau of Engraving and Printing] <span class="Italic">shall be fixed and adjusted from time to time as nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates</span>...as the paying authority of each such agency may determine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 USC &#x00A7; 5349(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a recent case, <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-26 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia </span>("<span class="Italic">Langley</span>"), 40 FLRA 118 (1991), the Authority held that wages under a related section of the Prevailing Rate Systems Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5343, met the terms of the "specifically provided for" exception. That provision also states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The pay of prevailing rate employees shall <span class="Italic">be fixed and adjusted from time to time as nearly as is consistent with the public interest in accordance with prevailing rates</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 USC &#x00A7; 5343(a) (emphasis added). The emphasized portions of the provisions are, obviously, identical. Citing a prior FLRA opinion, <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO and Dept. of Defense, Dept. of Army and Air Force, Headquarters, AAFES, Dallas, Texas</span> (<span class="Italic">"Dallas"</span>), 32 FLRA 591, 599-600 (1988) (Member McKee, concurring), the Authority in <span class="Italic">Langley</span> declared that "all aspects of pay-setting under the prevailing rate system are specifically provided for by law and, therefore, are excluded from the definition of conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14)(C)." 40 FLRA at 141.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To come out as it did in the present case, therefore, the Authority had either to distinguish <span class="Italic">Langley</span> and <span class="Italic">Dallas</span> or to reject them and explain the rejection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC</span>, 444 F.2d 841, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1970). It tried to distinguish the precedents, but its distinction does not add up.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The heart of the Authority's distinction was an assertion that &#x00A7; 5343 "'fix[ed]' wages by prescribing...the process of determining wages," 43 FLRA at 1215, whereas &#x00A7; 5349 left "'fixing' to the Agency, within the general parameters of prevailing rates and [the] public interest<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Therefore, the Authority concluded, &#x00A7; 5349(a) gave the Bureau "broad discretion to establish and maintain wage rates<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This treatment of &#x00A7; 5349(a) and &#x00A7; 5343 ignores the fact that both statutes direct the wage-setting agency, in identical language, to look to "prevailing rates" and the "public interest." Although &#x00A7; 5343 spells out more detail of the <span class="Italic">process </span>by which a prevailing rate is to be determined, it does not appear that the detail in &#x00A7; 5343 is likely to affect the substantive determination of "prevailing rate" materially. Section 5343(a)(1)(A), for example, requires a definition of the boundaries of "local wage areas" for employees having "regular wage schedules" and a similar definition for those having "special wage schedules." One would suppose that whatever substantive factors render an employee "regular" or "special" for these purposes would similarly affect any calculation under &#x00A7; 5349(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, while it is perfectly true that the "public interest" criterion of &#x00A7; 5349 gives the agency considerable discretion to override the "prevailing rate" outcome, that discretion appears indistinguishable from the public interest discretion afforded by &#x00A7; 5343. In fact, the cases discussing public interest discretion under various prevailing rate statutes seem to cite each other more or less interchangeably. Thus, <span class="Italic">Bradley v. United States</span>, 870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989), and <span class="Italic">Archer v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States</span>, 18 Cl. Ct. 603, 607 (1989), which the Authority invoked for the point that the public interest provision of &#x00A7; 5349 affords substantial discretion, both rely on <span class="Italic">Nat'l Maritime Union v. United States</span>, 231 Ct. Cl. 59, 682 F.2d 944 (1982), a &#x00A7; 5348 case, and <span class="Italic">Archer </span>relies as well on <span class="Italic">Blaha v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 183, 511 F.2d 1165 (1975), another &#x00A7; 5348 decision. Given the statutes' uniform and careful repetition of the language that we have quoted from &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5343 and 5349 (and which identically appears in &#x00A7; 5348), this interchangeability is hardly surprising. Thus there appears nothing in the public interest discretion under &#x00A7; 5349(a) that differs from that under &#x00A7; 5343. Given the apparent lack of a legally significant distinction here between the prevailing rate aspects of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5349(a) and 5343, the Authority's effort to distinguish the two statutes from each other, and this case from <span class="Italic">Langley</span> and <span class="Italic">Dallas</span>, falls apart.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Authority may of course wish to jettison <span class="Italic">Langley</span> and <span class="Italic">Dallas</span>. That prospect takes us to its brief references to <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA </span>495 U.S. 641. We agree with the Authority insofar as it regarded <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart </span>as implying that when a law confers relatively broad discretion on an agency to determine some aspect of employee pay, that aspect is not "specifically provided for" by statute and is accordingly outside &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(C)'s exception. <span class="Italic">See Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 649-50, 110 S. Ct. at 2048. As a consequence, insofar as the Third Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1409 (3d Cir. 1988), stood for the proposition that &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(C) categorically removed all aspects of wage-setting from potential bargaining, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1418-19, it cannot survive. So too for our own decision in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of Engraving and Printing v. FLRA</span>, 838 F.2d 1341 (D.C. Cir. 1988), which followed <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, so far as it relied on that view.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It does not, of course, follow that the scope of discretion under &#x00A7; 5349 is necessarily broad enough to take prevailing rate wage-setting out from the "specifically provided for" exception. The prevailing rate element appears to be more or less determinate, to some extent in contrast with the public interest factor. In <span class="Italic">Blaha v. United States</span>, 206 Ct. Cl. 183, 511 F.2d 1165 (Ct. Cl. 1975), for example, the court observed that the "'public interest' exception [in &#x00A7; 5348] was written to provide flexibility needed to eliminate anomalies and inequities that might arise from a too literal conformity to industry pay practices<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1170. The prevailing rate concept also is determinate enough to give rise to a monetary claim against the government under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1491; for example, in <span class="Italic">Blaha</span>, the court awarded workers damages when an agency paid wages lower than the prevailing rate figure and failed adequately to explain the reduction it had applied pursuant to its public interest discretion. Thus the agency's range of choice in the prevailing rate phase of the calculation is clearly not as broad as that permitted by the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span> which allowed the government employer freely to adjust teachers' wages and benefits so long as the total cost of educating students was equivalent to total per-pupil expenditures in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 656, 110 S. Ct. at 2052.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority may, however, after careful analysis of the public interest discretion under &#x00A7; 5349 (and, it appears, kindred statutes), conclude that because of that discretion the ultimate wage paid to Bureau employees is not "specifically provided for" by statute. (We would owe the Authority deference on its application of the &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(C) exception, <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart</span>, 495 U.S. at 644-45, 110 S. Ct. at 2046, but not on its interpretation of &#x00A7; 5349(a), <span class="Italic">see NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). Assuming that the public interest discretion is broad enough to render &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)(C) inapplicable to <span class="Italic">that</span> phase of wage-setting under &#x00A7; 5349(a), it will remain for the Authority to mesh the bargainability of that phase--and thus its potential reference to the Federal Service Impasses Panel (see 5 USC &#x00A7; 7119(b)(1))--with the apparent exclusion of the initial determination of the prevailing rate itself.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the requisite relationship exists between the governing statute and the matter in issue, in a long line of cases the Authority has analyzed whether the statute grants the agency discretion over the matter.... Under this analysis, the Authority will find that a matter is specifically provided for, within the meaning of subsection C, only to the extent that the governing statute leaves <span class="Italic">no</span> discretion to the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. and Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 29 FLRA 734, 835 (1987) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>) (Chairman Calhoun concurring in relevant part), <span class="Italic">enforced as to other</span> <span class="Italic">matters</span>, 911 F.2d 743 (D.C.

Conversely, when a statute provides an agency with discretion over a matter it is not excepted from the definition of conditions of employment to the extent of the agency's discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Department of Transportation, United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 191-93 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Merchant Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Academy</span>) (under section 1308(d) of the Maritime Education and Training Act of 1980 the agency has discretion to establish a pay system for employees; therefore, the salaries of those employees are not specifically provided for by statute).[8] Insofar as an agency has discretion, even if that discretion is less than total, it is subject to being exercised through negotiation<span class="Italic">. NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA at 10-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Where the discretion, regardless of its scope, is granted in a manner indicating that Congress intended it to be exercised <span class="Italic">only</span> by the agency--typically referred to by the Authority as discretion which is "sole and exclusive" or "unfettered"--negotiating how the discretion is exercised would be inconsistent with law. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3295 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA 884, 894-99 (1993), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>, 46 F.3d 73 (D.C. Cir. 1995). As noted above, the Agency argues that it has "sole and exclusive" discretion to set wages under section 5349(a); however, we reject that argument below in section IV.B. of our analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This analytic approach is derived from the text and grounded in the legislative history of the Statute.&#x2003;As stated above, by its express terms, subsection C is limited in two respects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the phrase "to the extent that" recognizes that a statute may be specific as to some aspects of a matter and not specific as to others. For example, an agency may be granted discretion over some aspects of a personnel matter while, at the same time, it is granted no discretion over other aspects. <span class="Italic">See Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Underwater Systems Center</span>, 38 FLRA at 487-88. In such case, only that aspect that is specifically provided for will be found to be excepted from the definition of condition of employment; the aspects over which an agency has discretion will not be so excepted. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-52, Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers and U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Texas</span>, 41 FLRA 1057, 1060-62 (1991), <span class="Italic">decision on remand as to other</span> <span class="Italic">matters</span> 48 FLRA 1198 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the term "specifically" also limits the reach of the exception. The dictionary defines "specifically" as "with exactness and precision; in a definite manner." Webster's Third New International Dictionary (ed. 1986). Relying on this ordinary meaning of the words used by Congress, <span class="Italic">see Smith v. United States</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2050, 2054 (1993), subsection C's exception applies to those statutory provisions that are precise in their prescription of what agencies may do. The Authority has found this required precision where a law asserted as the basis for a subsection C exception provides the agency with no discretion. <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 29 FLRA at 835.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the Authority has held in prior decisions that whether a statute "deals comprehensively" with a matter is relevant to determining whether the Statute "specifically provide[s] for" that matter within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C). <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 775-77 (1992) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Wisconsin Chapter and Wisconsin Army National Guard</span>, 26 FLRA 682, 684 (1987)). <span class="Italic">See also International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 13 FLRA 508, 514 (1983) (because Panama Canal Act established a comprehensive statutory scheme of wage determination, rates of basic pay are matters that are specifically provided for by that statute). These decisions do not address whether the statutes in issue leave an agency any discretion to determine the matters in dispute. To the extent that these decisions indicate that the comprehensiveness of a statutory scheme is a sufficient basis on which to find that a matter is specifically provided for, they are inconsistent with the analysis discussed above and the long line of Authority decisions that have applied it. <span class="Italic">See New Orleans District</span>, 3 FLRA at 759-60. For the reasons set forth in this decision, we will no longer find that a matter is within the subsection C exception without explicitly analyzing whether the governing statute leaves any discretion to the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wage Determination Under Section 5349</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On its face, section 5349 does not prescribe the actual pay rates of employees covered by that section. Instead, the statute sets forth a two-factor formula for determining the wages of employees covered by that provision. The statute provides, in relevant part, that the pay of BEP employees shall be: (1) established in accordance with prevailing rates; and (2) adjusted consistent with the public interest. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5349. For the following reasons, we conclude that the Agency has discretion under each of these factors and, as a result, neither phase of wage-setting under section 5349 is specifically provided for by that statutory provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prevailing Rate Factor</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5349 requires that the Agency establish pay rates for covered employees that are "in accordance with prevailing rates." [12] At the same time, it leaves the Agency considerable discretion over the process by which it determines what prevailing rate will guide it. For example, the Agency has discretion to determine whether to conduct a wage survey to establish wage rates and, if it decides to do so, to determine which criteria it will use to assess the comparability of jobs. It is clear from other laws that Congress has effectively removed discretion over certain matters from agencies. <span class="Italic">See, for example</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>. It also is clear that in enacting section 5349, Congress chose not to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Prevailing rates are wage rates that are, among other things, "in line with" wage rates paid by private employers for comparable work, and at a level "so as to attract and retain qualified prevailing rate employees." Prevailing Rate Systems Act, Pub. L. No. 92-392, 86 Stat. 564 (1972) (PRSA), codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5341(3), (4). Employees covered by section 5349(a), including BEP employees, are not subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5341 (section 5341) which sets forth the policy for wage-setting under the PRSA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5342(a)(1)(H) and 5342(b)(2)(A). However, the exclusion of BEP employees from the wage-setting policy in section 5341 does not warrant defining the term "prevailing rate" in section 5349 differently from the definition of that term in section 5341, where, as here, the prescribed meaning is not discordant with common usage so as to generate confusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2A <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span>, &#x00A7; 47.07, at 152 (5th ed. 1992). Accordingly, we adopt section 5341's definition of "prevailing rate" for purposes of interpreting that term in section 5349 of that statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That the Agency has discretion under section 5349 is evident from its past practice....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Public Interest Factor</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also has discretion under the public interest factor in Section 5349. In this phase of the wage-setting formula, pay for BEP employees is fixed and adjusted "as nearly as is consistent with the public interest." Pursuant to this statutory provision, the Agency has discretion to determine when to adjust, and the extent to which it will adjust, prevailing rates....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, it is well established that the Agency has discretion to adjust prevailing rates in the public interest. Consequently, we conclude that the public interest factor under section 5349 is not specifically provided for within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Langley and Dallas</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Langley</span> and <span class="Italic">Dallas</span> addressed wage determinations under section 5343, not section 5349, "both statutes direct the wage-setting agency, in identical language, to look to 'prevailing rates' and the 'public interest.'" <span class="Italic">BEP v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d at 303. Relying on this similarity between the statutory provisions, among other things, the court rejected the Authority's attempt to distinguish its holdings in <span class="Italic">Langley</span> and <span class="Italic">Dallas</span> that all aspects of pay-setting under <span id="page_952"></span>section 5343 were specifically provided for by Federal statute from its holding in <span class="Italic">IAMAW</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span> that pay-setting under section 5349 was not specifically provided for by Federal statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5343 and section 5349 were both enacted at the same time, as part of the same legislation, and both govern the establishment of wage rates for Federal prevailing rate employees. In addition, the public interest factor in both statutes is "identical." <span class="Italic">BEP v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d at 303. No basis is argued or apparent to distinguish the Agency's authority to adjust the prevailing rate in the public interest under section 5349 from the authority of an agency under section 5343 to vary prevailing rates in the public interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees v. Brown</span>, 645 F.2d 1017 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">NFFE v. Brown</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two sections are not identical in all respects, however. Unlike section 5349, for example, section 5343 <span class="Italic">requires</span> agencies to use wage surveys to determine prevailing rates. In addition, unlike section 5349, section 5343 prescribes certain details about how the surveys are to be conducted. Moreover, wage-setting under section 5343 is governed by principles established in section 5341--whose purpose is "to 'set standards of direction, that would control administrative practices and constrain executive discretion"--that are not applicable to wage-setting under section 5349. <span class="Italic">NFFE v. Brown</span>, 645 F.2d at 1024. Therefore, the discretion exercised by an agency under section 5343 to determine prevailing rates is significantly more constrained than that exercised by an agency under section 5349.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, section 5343 does not itself establish all aspects of a process that inevitably determines those rates. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> section 5343 <span class="Italic">with</span> 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 901 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (as held in <span class="Italic">Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools</span>, 45 FLRA at 1191-93, wages for overseas teachers are specifically provided for by 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 901 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. because that statute prescribes a process that inevitably determines those wages).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if prevailing rates derived from wage survey data are "more or less determinate" of wage rates ultimately paid under section 5343, this is not sufficient to come within the specifically provided for exception, because the agency still retains discretion under section 5343. <span class="Italic">BEP v. FLRA</span>, 995 F.2d at 304. As discussed above with respect to section 5349, the public interest factor in section 5343 gives agencies discretion to adjust prevailing rates derived from wage surveys. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE v. Brown</span>, 645 F.2d at 1025 ("the wage surveys made pursuant to &#x00A7; 5343 are nonbinding to this extent: executive officials may exercise discretion, 'consistent with the public interest,' to alter the rates suggested by the survey, provided that they do so within the confines of the principles of wage policy Congress established in [section] 5341").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the prevailing rate factor in section 5343 does not prescribe either the wage rates or every aspect of the process that necessarily determines them. Moreover, an agency has discretion under section 5343 to make public interest adjustments in prevailing rates. Thus, applying the analysis set forth above, it follows that all aspects of setting wage rates are not specifically provided for by section 5343, within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C). Therefore, the conclusions stated in <span class="Italic">Dallas</span> and <span class="Italic">Langley</span>--that all matters pertaining to wage rates for prevailing rate employees under section 5343 are specifically provided for by Federal statute--were erroneous. Some aspects of wage-setting under 5343 may be specifically provided for by that statute; proposals as to these aspects would be excepted from the definition of conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14)(C). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union, Local 200-B and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Syracuse, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 414, 417-18 (1991). However, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Dallas</span> and <span class="Italic">Langley</span> extend to all aspects of pay-setting, we will no longer follow those decisions or others based on the same rationale.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Where law or applicable regulation vests an agency with sole and exclusive discretion over a matter, it would be contrary to law to require that discretion to be exercised through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA at 894-99. The Authority resolves an agency's claim that a matter is not negotiable because it has sole and exclusive discretion by examining the plain wording and the legislative history of the statute being relied on. <span class="Italic">See, for example, id</span>. at 894-95.[24] In the absence of any indication in the wording or the legislative history of section 5349 that Congress intended the Agency's discretion to set wages under section 5349 to be sole and exclusive, the Authority finds that the exercise of discretion under that provision through collective bargaining is not inconsistent with law. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union, Local 200-B and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Syracuse, New York</span>, 44 FLRA 821, 828 (1992). Inasmuch as Congress has specifically determined that collective bargaining concerning employees, terms and conditions of employment "safeguards the public interest[,]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a), we are unable to conclude, as the Agency argues, that collective bargaining concerning the exercise of discretion under this provision would be inconsistent with law or otherwise not in the public interest. <span class="Italic">See also Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and</span> <span class="Italic">Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 102 (1983); <span class="Italic">Patent Office</span> <span class="Italic">Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 814 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;In this regard, the Authority has found that the phrase "without regard to other laws" is a strong indication that Congress intended the agency involved to have sole and exclusive discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Council of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Locals and VA, Washington, D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 923, 933-34 (1994) (<span class="Italic">citing Illinois National Guard v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396, 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the plain wording or legislative history of section 5349 demonstrates that the Agency's discretion under that section is intended to be sole and exclusive. <span class="Italic">Cf. Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1490-91 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA at 892-99. Further, contrary to the Agency's argument, we find the possibility that the FSIP, in fulfilling its mandated role to resolve negotiation impasses, may impose a pay proposal on parties provides no basis for finding that collective bargaining is inconsistent with law. Such action by the FSIP would be wholly consistent with the collective bargaining process established by Congress under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter</span> <span class="Italic">83 and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 414-16 (1990). Consequently, we conclude that the proposals, which require the exercise of the agency's discretion through collective bargaining, are not inconsistent with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Veterans Canteen Service, Lexington, Kentucky</span>, 44 FLRA 162 (1992).</p>
