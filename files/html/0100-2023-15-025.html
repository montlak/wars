<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-26"><span class="space">8.</span> Family Leave</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1993, Congress enacted statutes, affecting both private and federal sector employees, that require employers to grant employees leave or leave without pay for serious illness, for the care of family members and for the birth of a child or an adoption or the provision of foster care to a child of an employee. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act requires some grants of leave, conditions some grants of leave on medical certification, and provides for continuation of certain employment benefits and return rights to the employee who uses the leave granted by statute. The statute permits a qualifying employee to take a maximum of 12 administrative workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 434, 441 (1998). The statute, 5 USC 6381-6387, is implemented by OPM regulations at 5 CFR 630 Subpart L (2022). Employees of the Postal Service are covered by the FMLA and its implementing regulations at 29 CFR Part 825 (2022). The FMLA does not provide an independent basis for Board jurisdiction. "The Board adjudicates claims that an agency failed to comply with the terms of the FMLA in leave-related disciplinary action appeals." <span class="Italic">Lua v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 647, 651 &#x00B6; 12 (2001). [Refer to Carl Bosland's <span class="Italic">Federal Sector Guide to the FMLA and Related Litigation</span> (<span class="blue">Dewey Publications, Inc.</span> 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute provides, in part, at 5 USC 6382:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 6382. <span class="Italic">Leave requirement</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1) Subject to section 6383 and subsection (d)(2) of this section, an employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;Because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and in order to care for such son or daughter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;Because of the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;In order to care for the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent, of the employee, if such spouse, son, daughter, or parent has a serious health condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2463"></span>(D)&#x2003;Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the spouse, or a son, daughter, or parent of the employee is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Armed Forces.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;The entitlement to leave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) based on the birth or placement of a son or daughter shall expire at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of such birth or placement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Subject to section 6383, an employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember shall be entitled to a total of 26 administrative workweeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for the servicemember. The leave described in this paragraph shall only be available during a single 12-month period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (d)(2), during the single 12-month period described in paragraph (3), an employee shall be entitled to a combined total of 26 administrative workweeks of leave under paragraphs (1) and (3). Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the availability of leave under paragraph (1) during any other 12-month period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1) Leave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) shall not be taken by an employee intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule unless the employee and the employing agency of the employee agree otherwise. Subject to paragraph (2), subsection (e)(2), and subsection (b)(5) or (f) (as appropriate) of section 6383, leave under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) or under subsection (a)(3) may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary.

<p class="Body-Text">FMLA does not provide independent jurisdiction over federal employees' claims to the Board. The protections of the statute can be raised in defense to an otherwise appealable action, <span class="Italic">Bogumill v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3195):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Bogumill's only contention in her third appeal, the one before us now, is that her rights under the FMLA were violated when she received less than sixty days' notice of the proposed reduction-in-force. Although the FMLA grants a private right of action to an employee in the private sector who alleges violation of FMLA rights, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 USC &#x00A7; 2617(a)(2) (1994), the FMLA does not afford such a right of action to a federal employee, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6381-6387 (1994). The courts have recognized the distinction between private sector employees and federal government employees with regard to enforcement rights, and have held that no independent right of action is available to federal government employees to enforce their FMLA rights. <span class="Italic">See Mann v. Haigh</span>, 120 F.3d 34, 37 (4th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Keen v. Brown</span>, 958 F. Supp. 70, 72-75 (D. Conn. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because there is no independent cause of action available to a federal employee to assert violations of the FMLA, a federal employee can only raise such asserted violations in connection with actions over which the Board otherwise has jurisdiction. For example, when a federal employee is suspended for twenty days for taking leave without pay, the employee may contest the suspension if the challenged taking of leave without pay is authorized under the FMLA<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gross v. Department of Justice</span>, 77 MSPR 83, 88 (1997). Thus, in order for the Board to have the power to consider an alleged violation of the FMLA, the federal employee must also assert some appealable adverse action taken against the employee in which the alleged violation of the FMLA is implicated.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 85 MSPR 612, 622 &#x00B6; 16 (2000) (directing the AJ to consider an appellant's assertion that an agency AWOL charge violated the FMLA and violated a last chance agreement that would have otherwise waived a Board appeal right from a dismissal for AWOL); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Landahl v.

<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not take action against an employee for FMLA that is properly requested and used, <span class="Italic">Scott v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-10-0198-I-1 (NP 9/8/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, any employee who takes FMLA leave "for the intended purpose of the leave shall be entitled, upon return from such leave--(1) to be restored by the employing agency to the position held by the employee when the leave commenced; or (2) to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6384(a). Because Congress's clear intent when enacting FMLA was to provide job security for individuals who needed to be temporarily absent due to a serious medical condition (whether their own or that of a family member addressed by the FMLA legislation) and the law unambiguously promises this job security, use of FMLA in any calculation to remove an employee is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 11 (2011).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the FMLA, an employee is entitled to 12 workweeks of leave during any 12 month period for, among other events, "a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2612(a)(1)(D). A serious health condition is defined as an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2611(11). For serious health conditions, the agency may require that an FMLA leave request be supported by a certification from a health care provider setting forth (1) the date on which the condition began, (2) the probable duration of the condition, (3) the appropriate medical facts regarding the condition, (4) a statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his position, and (5) for intermittent leave, a statement of the medical necessity for and expected duration of the intermittent leave. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2613(b). "An employee shall provide at least verbal notice sufficient to make the employer aware that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the anticipated timing and duration of the leave." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.302(c). The employee need not expressly assert rights under the FMLA or even mention the FMLA, however. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to have begun the process of requesting FMLA leave around June 12, 2003, but the agency evidently did not receive his supporting medical documentation until July 31, 2003. The appellant testified that the delay in submitting his FMLA paperwork was due to the fact that one doctor refused to sign the paperwork, and because there were delays due to vacations in the office of the doctor who eventually signed it. The appellant's FMLA leave request and medical documentation in support thereof are not part of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency approved the appellant's FMLA leave request as a result of the medical documentation he submitted on July 31, 2003, that approval was for intermittent absences of 4 to 6 days monthly beginning on July 31, 2003. This approved FMLA leave did not cover the appellant's previous unscheduled absences during the period from March 20, 2003, until July 24, 2003, for which the appellant's removal was proposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, of the eleven unscheduled absences for which the appellant's removal was proposed, at least one appears to have been for influenza, not his knee condition. The appellant testified that he "guessed" the remaining unscheduled absences were caused by his knee. However, there is no evidence regarding what the appellant told his employers when he requested those absences. In his testimony, the appellant conceded that the absences in question pre-dated his formal request for FMLA leave, and acknowledged that he had to submit proper documentation to support an FMLA claim. The record before us does not establish that the appellant requested FMLA leave for the absences upon which his August 15, 2003 proposed removal was based, nor that he provided the agency with notice that his unscheduled absences were necessitated by an FMLA-qualifying condition. Accordingly, the appellant has not established, or even argued, that he provided notice sufficient to make the agency aware that he needed FMLA-qualifying leave prior to his July 31, 2003 submission of medical documentation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.302(c). Additionally, it does not appear that the agency interfered with the appellant's FMLA rights in any other respect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis of the 1993 FMLA generally, and as applied to Postal Service employees, is provided by <span class="Italic">Ramey v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 463, 465-69 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the position of Distribution Clerk for failure to satisfactorily maintain a regular schedule owing to the use of unscheduled leave. The agency alleged that during 7 intervals the appellant's unscheduled absences totaled 246.68 hours, and that one absence, on March 2, 1994, involved 8 hours of absence without leave (AWOL).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained the agency's action. He found that the appellant admitted that he was absent as charged, and that the agency therefore proved by the preponderance of the evidence that the appellant was absent without prior approval, and failed to maintain a regular work schedule. He also found that, because the appellant was on notice that unscheduled absences were not acceptable, his absences constituted failure to meet the attendance requirements of his position. Additionally, the administrative judge sustained the March 2 AWOL charge based on the appellant's failure to request leave or to provide evidence of an emergency prohibiting him from requesting leave on that date. Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not <span id="Page_2465"></span>prove that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of race, sex, age, or handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 29 USC &#x00A7; 2601, 5 USC &#x00A7; 6381, gives "eligible" employees of a covered employer the right to take unpaid leave, or paid leave if it has been earned, for a period of up to 12 workweeks in any 12-month period because of the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, because the employee is needed to care for a family member with a serious health condition, or because the employee's own serious health condition makes the employee unable to do his or her job. Under certain circumstances, this leave may be taken on an intermittent basis rather than all at once. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.100. Employees of the Postal Service are covered by the FMLA and its implementing regulations found at 29 CFR Part 825.[1] 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.109. The FMLA was enacted on February 5, 1993, and the Postal Service became subject to its provisions, with respect to its employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, effective February 5, 1994. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.102(a). The FMLA requires that the Postal Service post, and keep posted on its premises, a notice explaining the FMLA's provisions, and that the Postal Service include information regarding FMLA entitlements and employee obligations in written guidance concerning employee benefits or leave rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.300, 825.301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The FMLA covers most federal employees. Non-Postal Service federal employees are covered by the regulatory provisions promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR Part 630, Subpart L.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an adverse action is predicated on the agency's erroneous interference with an employee's rights under the FMLA, such adverse action is in violation of law, and it may not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C). An administrative judge's adjudication of an action not only embraces the provisions of law giving the Board jurisdiction over the action, but includes review of any other relevant provision of law, regulation or negotiated procedures as circumstances warrant<span class="Italic">. See Adakai v. Department of the Interior</span>, 20 MSPR 196, 202 (1984). The employee has the burden of proving that an action is not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fleming v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 302, 308 (1986), the Board held that, the Postal Service may discipline an employee for use of unscheduled approved leave when: (1) leave is not requested in accordance with the agency's leave-requesting procedures; and (2) the employee is on clear notice that unscheduled absences caused by the failure to follow leave-requesting procedures can result in disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See also Wilkinson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 68 MSPR 4, 7-8 (1995) (charges of failing to properly request sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay can be maintained by an agency that is bound by laws and regulations that govern leave administration in the civil service, so long as the employee is on notice of the agency's requirements). When an employee has an unscheduled absence meeting the requirements of FMLA leave, however, an agency's charge of unscheduled absence must be scrutinized in light of the employee's rights and requirements under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Manuel v. Westlock Polymers Corporation</span>, 66 F.3d 758, 760, 763 (5th Cir. 1995) (private-sector employee, terminated for excessive absences under employer's "no fault" leave policy, was entitled to raise FMLA defense). The FMLA therefore may be a relevant and material defense to a charge that requires proof of failure to follow leave procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the appellant's charged unscheduled absences occurred after passage of the FMLA on February 5, 1993, and 5 1/2 occurred after February 5, 1994, the date that the Postal Service became subject to the provisions of the FMLA. At the hearing, counsel asserted that the appellant's serious illness, depression, falls within the meaning of the term illness as used in the FMLA and that the appellant is thus a qualifying employee under the FMLA. He also asserted that the agency did not communicate to the appellant that he had to make his leave request under the FMLA. The appellant maintained that the agency interfered with his right to request and receive FMLA leave, and to be subject to its leave-requesting requirements, by failing to meet its responsibility under the FMLA to post notice of the availability of such leave and to inform him of his rights and obligations under the FMLA in written guidance concerning employee leave rights. Finally, counsel was fully prepared to proceed with the defense at the hearing. After he objected that the administrative judge's ruling prevented him from establishing the factual predicate upon which to establish an agency violation of the FMLA, he represented that he had "ten series of questions" regarding such alleged violation. Because the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency erroneously interfered with his rights to request FMLA leave (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, he is an eligible employee with a "serious health condition" receiving continuing treatment by a health care provider, he requested leave as early as practicable, the agency granted his leave requests, but the agency removed him notwithstanding the FMLA), the administrative judge erred in disallowing him the opportunity to present evidence in support of his assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted in the initial decision that he also disallowed the FMLA defense because the agency could reasonably remove the appellant based solely on the sustained AWOL. The appellant, however, alleged that his AWOL as well as his irregular attendance resulted from his depressive illness. Since the FMLA has its own procedures for both the requesting and granting of leave, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2612-2613; 29 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.112, 825.200 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> 825.302 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> the appellant might have qualified for FMLA leave for the time which has been charged as AWOL. Thus, both the AWOL charge and the charge of failure to follow leave procedures must be examined with regard to the FMLA claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of the FMLA to Postal Service employees was again explored, <span class="Italic">Byrdsell v. USPS,</span> NY-0752-09-0161-I-1 (NP 9/17/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted, both below and on review, that the agency's charge of Failure to be Regular in Attendance cannot be sustained because the agency violated the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) on the dates of his absences. To be eligible for FMLA leave, however, a U.S. Postal Service employee must have been employed by the employer for at least 12 months, and must have been employed for at least 1,250 hours of service during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2611(2); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 635, &#x00B6; 16 (1999); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.110(a). In general, whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of service is determined according to the principles established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) for determining compensable hours of work. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.110(c)(1). Under the FLSA, vacation, holiday pay, sick leave, and unpaid leave are not counted toward compensable hours of work. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(e). Thus, they are not included in the 1,250-hour requirement under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">See Ricco v. Potter</span>, 377 F.3d 599, 604-05 (6th Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 635, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the evidence of record, including a PS Form 3972 (Absence Analysis), the appellant did not have 1,250 hours of service before the unscheduled absences at issue in this case began on November 3, 2007. Instead, it appears that he had 960 hours of full 8-hour workdays, and 221 hours of partial workdays, for a total of 1181 hours worked. Even assuming, however, that the appellant was eligible for FMLA leave for any of the charged unscheduled absences, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant did not show that he provided the agency with updated medical certification supporting any request for leave under the FMLA, as requested by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.308(b) (in all cases, an employer may request a recertification of a medical condition every six months in connection with an absence by the employee).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 states that an eligible employee shall be entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his position. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2611-2619(a)(1)(D) (2000). FMLA may be taken all at once or "intermittently." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.203 (2004).

While this may be the case, this documentation does not specifically explain if the later five absences from April and May of 2001 were actually related to Mr. Warren's medical condition. The Postal Service has the discretion to require specific documentation when an employee requests FMLA to determine if the absence should be covered by FMLA. The Postal Service requested documentation from Mr. Warren to explain these absences and he did not provide it.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiens v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 176 Fed. Appx. 101, 103-05 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), emphasized the need for a proper request for FMLA leave and for proper certification supporting the request:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Wiens argues that the Board failed to take into account her February 26, 2002, request for FMLA leave, and that if she had been granted the 480 hours of FMLA leave at that time rather than the 200 hours which she did receive, she would not have incurred the charges that led to her removal. According to Wiens, her doctor advised her to take leave under FMLA and she submitted the required documentation to support 480 hours of FMLA leave on February 25, 2004. Wiens also contends that the Agency violated FMLA regulations when it approved only 200 hours of FMLA leave rather than the 480 hours she had requested in her FMLA application. In addition, Wiens asserts that the Agency violated her rights by using her FMLA entitlements "in a negative factor." Finally, Wiens argues that her employment records submitted to the Board were "inaccurate" and that "modifications" were made to her attendance records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that the Board properly considered Wiens' request for FMLA leave in determining that her removal was reasonable. The government also argues that the Agency acted properly in addressing Wiens' request for FMLA leave in February 2002 because the doctor did not certify a number of hours for FMLA leave and she did not reapply for more FMLA leave after the 200 hours she was granted had expired. In addition, the government asserts that Wiens was not penalized for leave she took pursuant to the FMLA: her removal was based on excessive AWOL when she was not taking or entitled to FMLA leave. Finally, the government argues that there was no evidence in the record that the Agency's employment records for Wiens were inaccurate or that her attendance records had been modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board did not fail to take into account Wiens' February 26, 2002, request for FMLA leave. The Board specifically considered her request for FMLA leave and found that the specifications of AWOL that led to her removal occurred after she had exhausted the 200 hours of FMLA that was approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the government that the Agency did not act improperly in addressing Wiens' February 26, 2002, request for FMLA leave. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6310.1203(a)(4) provides that eligible federal employees are "entitled to a total of 12 administrative workweeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period for...[a] serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of his or her position." However, an agency may require that a request for leave under &#x00A7; 631.1203(a)(4) "be supported by written medical certification," and also require "subsequent medical recertification on a periodic basis, but not more than once every 30 calendar days, for leave taken for purposes relating to...chronic conditions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 630.1207(a), (j) (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is evidence in the record to suggest that Wiens initially requested 480 hours of leave in her February 26, 2002, application, and the Agency later determined that her request was for 200 hours. However, nothing in the FMLA regulations requires that agencies <span class="Italic">must</span> grant 480 hours of FMLA leave for a 12-month period every time an employee applies for it. Moreover, Wiens' physician did not indicate a number of hours of FMLA leave in his medical certification. Thus, the Agency did not act improperly in granting Wiens 200 hours of FMLA leave, and then requiring Wiens to submit further medical certification for additional leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, there is no merit to Wiens' argument that she was not given notice when she had exhausted the 200 hours of FMLA leave. On March 5, 2002, Wiens received notice that she had been approved for 200 hours of FMLA leave. At the end of that 200-hour period in July 2002, Wiens was informed by her supervisor that she would need to provide a doctor's note in order to be recertified. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(g) (2005) ("Each agency shall inform its employees of their entitlements and responsibilities under [the FMLA regulations], including the requirements and obligations of employees."). Even though Wiens was notified of the requirements for obtaining additional FMLA leave, she failed to reapply or re-certify. Thus, the Agency was entitled to consider Wiens' absences after her FMLA leave expired to be AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject Wiens' argument that the Board violated her rights by using her FMLA entitlements "in a negative factor." Wiens was not penalized for leave she took pursuant to the FMLA. Rather, the Agency removed Wiens based on her repeated occasions of AWOL when she was not taking or entitled to FMLA leave. There is also no evidence to support Wiens' assertion that her employment records were inaccurate and her attendance records were modified. Whether the records were accurate is a credibility determination based on conflicting testimony, and we defer to the trier of fact on that issue. <span class="Italic">See Hambsch v. Dep't of Treasury,</span> 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (credibility determinations "virtually unreviewable" on appeal). Here, there is no evidence in the record that the employment records were inaccurate or that the attendance records had been modified. Therefore, we conclude that the Board's determination that the records were accurate was not "unsupported by substantial evidence."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The FMLA allows an employee to take up to 12 weeks of leave per year (paid or unpaid) for various purposes, including an employee's own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6382(a)(1)(D); <span class="Italic">Dias v.

If FMLA leave for a serious health condition is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee shall generally provide notice of the intention to take leave not less than 30 calendar days before the date the leave is to begin, and shall consult with the agency and make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(a)-(b). If the need for leave is not foreseeable and the employee cannot provide 30 calendar days' notice of the need for leave, the employee shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(c). An agency may waive the notice requirements under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(a) and instead impose the agency's usual and customary policies or procedures for providing notification of leave, but such notification policies or procedures must not be more stringent than the requirements set forth in section 630.1206. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206(e). An employee is not required to specifically invoke the FMLA in requesting covered leave, but must present sufficient evidence to trigger consideration of the absences under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Fairley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 588, 591 (1999).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Each agency shall inform its employees of their entitlements and responsibilities under subpart L, Family and Medical Leave, of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, including the requirements and obligations of employees. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(g). Here, the agency complied with this requirement by notifying the appellant in its command leave policy of the above information relating to the FMLA. The appellant testified that he received the leave policy but did not read the section relating to the FMLA because he did not believe that the FMLA applied to his own serious health condition, as opposed to those of his family. The appellant has not identified any law, rule, or regulation that required the agency to "offer" him FMLA leave for particular absences under the circumstances of this case. Moreover, although the appellant claims that the agency's Letters of Requirement were more stringent than the "FMLA's leave policy," those letters, issued on March 27, 2008 and May 29, 2008, informed the appellant that his leave and attendance record presented a pattern of excessive and/or abusive leave, and implemented leave restrictions and requirements including the submission of medical certificates from a health care practitioner in support of sick leave requests that included the dates of services, a description of the illness or injury, a brief description of the treatment received, the exact dates of incapacitation from work, and the medical practitioner's legible name, address, telephone number, and signature; they did not impose more stringent requirements for providing <span class="Italic">notification</span> of leave than those set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1206. Moreover, to the extent that the appellant may be alleging that the agency imposed more stringent medical certification requirements than those set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b), we disagree. The agency's Letters of Requirement did not, for example, even fully apply those certification requirements by requiring the appellant to submit a medical statement indicating that he was unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1207(b)(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the record shows that the appellant did not request FMLA leave or sick leave, or otherwise present sufficient evidence to trigger consideration under the FMLA for the absences involved in the second specification of the Failure to Follow Instructions charge and the AWOL charge. The agency charged the appellant with Failure to Follow Instructions by failing to request leave or call in on April 14, 2008, and with <span id="Page_2467"></span>AWOL for May 13-15, 2008, May 19-23, May 27-29, June 23-27, and June 30, 2008. The appellant's March 12, 2008 e-mail informed Lingua that he had visited his personal physician who referred him to see a psychiatrist or psychologist for stress management, he had work-induced stress, hypertension, and depression resulting in severe headaches, nausea, and insomnia, and his doctor and he believed that "this is from lack of conflict resolution in defining my future, especially where my career direction is going and the lack of priority that you are taking in meeting with me to work on these issues." Although the appellant wrote that "[n]ow you know why I requested a facilitated meeting and to go on leave from Rick and you in early February because of no progress in working out these issues," he did not request leave or indicate a need for leave in the future.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant ultimately submitted three Verification of Treatment forms from his doctor and one letter from his psychotherapist which showed that the appellant either received medical treatment or followed his doctor's instructions and stayed home on March 5, 2008, March 31, 2008, April 2-3, 2008, April 7, 2008, April 9-10, 2008, April 14, 2008, April 16, 2008, April 21-23, 2008, April 25, 2008, April 28-29, 2008, May 1, 2008, May 3, 2008, May 5-6, 2008, May 8-9, 2008, May 12, 2008, May 16, 2008, June 2-6, 2008, June 9-12, 2008, and June 16-20, 2008. The appellant has identified nothing in the FMLA or OPM's regulations implementing the FMLA that prohibited the agency from requiring him to call in or request leave on April 14, 2008. Moreover, none of the dates for which the appellant was charged AWOL are covered by the medical certificates he submitted. In fact, the appellant <span class="Italic">did</span> make an April 30, 2008 request for "compensatory time off' for vacations for the periods from May 19-29, 2008, and from June 23, 2008 to July 3, 2008. However, these requests were not approved by Lingua. The appellant has shown no error or abuse of discretion in the agency's decision to disapprove these requests for compensatory time off. <span class="Italic">Cf. Benally v. Department of the Interior,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 537, 541 (1996) (annual leave is an entitlement subject to the agency's right to fix the time at which it is taken). Thus, the agency's actions did not violate the FMLA, and the AJ correctly sustained these charges.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The application of the FMLA to an unscheduled absence was analyzed by <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 635, 642-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee has an unscheduled absence meeting the requirements for FMLA leave, an agency's charge of unscheduled absence must be scrutinized in light of the employee's rights and requirements under the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Ramey v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 MSPR 463, 468 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds, Ellshoff</span> <span class="Italic">v. Department of the Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 54 (1997). The FMLA, therefore, may be a relevant and material consideration in determining whether the agency has proved a charge of unscheduled absence if the employee satisfies all of the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave, including that he has been employed for at least 1250 hours of service with a covered employer during the 12-month period preceding the use of the FMLA leave, 29 USC &#x00A7; 2611 (2)(A)(ii), for his unscheduled absences<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The agency submitted copies of the appellant's Absence Analysis for 1994, 1995, and 1996. This evidence shows that for the year preceding the specified absences of "5/30/96," "5/9-5/20/96," "4/24-5/3/96," 4/16-17/96," and "4/8-4/12/96," the appellant did not have at least 1250 hours of service during the 12-month period preceding the use of FMLA leave under the definition of hours worked provided in the FMLA. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Robbins v. Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, Inc.,</span> 896 F. Supp. 18, 20-21 (D.D.C. 1995) (under the FMLA, "hours worked" does not include time paid but not "worked" (paid vacation, personal or sick leave, holidays), nor does it include unpaid leave (of any kind) or periods of layoff; whether the hours are compensated or uncompensated is not determinative for purposes of FMLA's 1250-hours-of-service test). Thus, the appellant does not satisfy all of the eligibility requirements for FMLA leave for these unscheduled absences, and the FMLA does not preclude sustaining the charge of failure to meet the attendance requirements of his position based on those unscheduled absences. Accordingly, we find that the agency proved that the appellant was ineligible for FMLA leave for five of the seven specifications of unscheduled absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was eligible for FMLA leave for the unscheduled absences of "12/29/95" and "12/3-6/96": He had at least 1250 hours of service during the 12-month period preceding the use of the FMLA leave; he testified without contradiction that his unscheduled absences were due to his serious health condition, Meniere's disease; and there is no evidence that the agency requested that the appellant support his need for FMLA leave by a certification issued by his health care provider. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 825.305....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analysis under the FMLA advanced a tad in <span class="Italic">Crutchfield v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 444, 446-48 (1997). The statute does not augment an employee's leave balance: the statute gives an employee the option of using accrued paid leave or requesting LWOP. The statute is applied only to the employee's leave balance at the time the employee's leave request is made; the Board will not speculate on what the employee's leave balance would have been had the employee been entitled to FMLA leave for prior absences and LWOP instead of accrued paid leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sustaining all specifications of the AWOL charge, the AJ found that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying leave without pay (LWOP) for these absences, under the totality of the circumstances. Regarding the appellant's argument below that the agency should have granted her leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) for her absences related to her migraine headaches, the AJ found that she was not entitled to FMLA leave because she failed to place the agency on notice that she suffered from a "serious health condition" covered by the FMLA.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) became effective on August 5, 1993, for non-Postal federal civilian employees, and entitles an eligible employee to take up to twelve weeks of LWOP in any twelve-month period for a "serious health condition," subject to notice and medical documentation requirements under some circumstances. 5 USCA 6381 &#x0026; Historical and Statutory Notes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to an apparent presumption underlying the appellant's argument, the FMLA does not, in itself, augment an employee's leave balance: it merely entitles the employee to approved leave for certain covered reasons and gives the employee the option of using accrued paid leave (annual or sick leave) or LWOP. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 6382(a)(1), (c), (d). Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant was entitled to FMLA leave for the [&#8197;] prior absences, it is just as likely as not that she would have elected to use any accrued paid leave, rather than LWOP, for such absences, so that any entitlement to FMLA leave would not have necessarily affected her accrued leave balance. Thus, in reviewing the propriety of an agency's denial of an employee's request for leave, the Board will take the employee's leave balance as it exists at the time the request is made: we will not engage in speculation as to what that balance would have been if the employee had been entitled to FMLA leave for prior absences and had elected LWOP despite having accrued paid leave.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;After the AJ issued the initial decision in this appeal, the Office of Personnel Management issued final regulations implementing Title II of the FMLA. 61 Fed. Reg. 64,441 (1996). Because the final regulations are effective January 6, 1997, they are not directly applicable to this appeal. We note, nevertheless, that the final regulations state that the employee "shall invoke his or her entitlement" to FMLA leave. 5 CFR 630.1203(b) (1997). The accompanying commentary explains that this requirement is necessary to "eliminate misunderstandings between supervisors and employees" and that "[a]n employee may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to leave under the FMLA for a previous absence from work." 61 Fed. Reg. 64445 (1996). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Manuel v. Westlock Polymers Corp.</span>, 66 F.3d 758, 761 n.2, 762-63 (5th Cir. 1995) (the court applied the interim regulations implementing Title I of the FMLA, which were applicable during the relevant times, but interpreted them in the context of the final regulations to the extent that the latter clarified or shed light on the former).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the appellant's argument that, had she been granted FMLA leave for her current migraine-related absences, she would have had sufficient accrued leave to cover her other current absences for which she was charged AWOL. This argument is similarly without merit. The appellant was charged AWOL for these migraine-related absences because she had no accrued leave at the time. Since she had no accrued leave to use for these absences, whether under the FMLA or otherwise, any entitlement to FMLA for these absences would not have affected her leave balance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not otherwise specifically dispute the AJ's determination that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying LWOP for the nonmigraine-related absences. We therefore find no reason to disturb the AJ's finding that these specifications of AWOL--on September 14-15, 16, 23, 26, October 11-14, 20, and December 1-2, 5, 8--should be sustained. 5 CFR 1201.115(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on petition for review that the AJ erred by finding that her failure to place the agency on notice that she suffered from a "serious health condition" precluded her entitlement to FMLA leave for these absences on September 29, 30, October 24-25, 28, and November l, 4, 7-8, 10, 16, 18, 23. She reiterates her arguments below that she satisfied all of the requirements for entitlement to FMLA leave for these absences. We find it unnecessary to address the merits of these FMLA issues because, even assuming that the appellant was entitled to FMLA leave for these absences, the remaining, nonmigraine-related specifications of AWOL are sufficient to warrant sustaining the charge of AWOL. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stein v. US Postal Service</span>, 57 MSPR 434, 438 (1993) (proof of only one specification supporting a charge is sufficient to sustain the charge). Moreover, the remaining specifications are sufficient to warrant sustaining the penalty of removal, as discussed below.</p>

Instead, she argues, her nine hours of FMLA leave on April 11, 2005 marked the beginning of a first 12-month period, which ended on April 10, 2006. A second 12-month period then began on April 11, 2006, and she was entitled to an additional 12 weeks of leave under the FMLA. Brantley also argues that her approved application for FMLA leave for the period from February 1 to September 30, 2006 shows that the entire period of leave was supported by an appropriate medical certification. Finally, Brantley repeats her argument that she properly followed leave procedures and that the IRS retaliated against her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that Brantley is limited to 12 weeks of leave in any given 12-month period and that Brantley's failure to submit medical documentation after June 6, 2006 prevented her from any entitlement to FMLA leave. The government also points out that there is no record evidence that Brantley <span class="Italic">first</span> took FMLA leave in April 2005, only that she took FMLA leave in April 2005. Finally, the government argues that removal was reasonable given the nature and seriousness of the offenses, their disruptive impact, and a prior demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that Brantley was not entitled to FMLA leave between June 6 and July 28, 2006. Like the Board, we do not rely on the AJ's findings that Brantley had exhausted her FMLA leave as of April 26, 2006. In fact, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 630.1203(c), the 12-month period must begin on the date Brantley first took leave, which Brantley asserts is April 11, 2005. Another 12-month period would then have begun on April 11, 2006, and Brantley would have been entitled to another 12 weeks of FMLA leave any time in that 12-month period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Instead of finding that Brantley was not entitled to another leave period until January 31, 2007, the AJ should have determined that Brantley was entitled to another 12 weeks of annual FMLA leave beginning on April 11, 2006.</p>
