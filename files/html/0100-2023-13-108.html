<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-107"><span class="space">8.</span> Temporary Absence Resulting From Intolerable Working Conditions</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant may be constructively suspended if she is forced out of the work site by intolerable working conditions and can return only when those conditions are abated. The analysis parallels cases involving involuntary retirements, resignations, and downgradings and has some similarity to enforced leave litigation, [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-083.html#sec6-83">Enforced Leave; Constructive Suspension</a>"]. The Board remanded several joined appeals for a jurisdictional hearing in <span class="Italic">Peoples v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 216, 218-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12 (1999), after it determined that several employees left the work site as a result of a coworker's unrestrained bizarre and threatening behavior and based on advice from the agency's EAP counselor that the employees were risking their health by remaining on the job and risking further interaction with their coworker:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 25, 1998, the appellants sought the assistance of the agency Employee Assistance Program counselor with regard to the alleged continuing bizarre behavior of their coworker, James Bailey. The appellants alleged that he "yelled and screamed" at one of them, and wrote letters suggesting that they were "working with the devil." The appellants stated that they feared that Bailey considered himself an "avenging angel" who would carry out judgment on them. The counselor advised them not to return to their work stations. They did not return to their work stations, and at least three appellants apparently have remained away from work since that time. She referred three, Jean Peoples, Patricia Rountree, and Margaret Brown, for psychiatric treatment. She recommended continuing counseling for Audrey Myers. On March 3, 1998, the appellants petitioned for appeal, alleging that they were forced to leave their work stations by intolerable working conditions, and that thus the agency constructively suspended them....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that intolerable working conditions may render a resignation or a retirement involuntary, and thus appealable to the Board as a removal. Intolerable working conditions may render an action involuntary when, under all the circumstances, the working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to leave the workplace. <span class="Italic">See Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 MSPR 574, 577 (1996); <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The touchstone of the analysis, and the common element in all of our cases involving involuntary personnel actions "is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making processes that deprived him or her of freedom of choice...." <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 519. The Board evaluates the <span id="Page_2110"></span>voluntariness of a particular personnel action "based on whether the totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that the employee was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 519-20. The totality of the circumstances are examined by an objective standard, not the employee's purely subjective evaluation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 520. Under that objective standard, "the Board will find the resignation involuntary only if the employee demonstrates that the...agency engaged in a course of action that made working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 522.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously recognized, in cases involving an absence from work based upon the employee's medical condition, that allegations of intolerable working conditions may establish an involuntary or constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Thibodeaux v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 76 MSPR 178, 181 (1997); <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 MSPR 635, 639-40 (1997); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 680, 692 (1996). We find these cases apt, and by analogy recognize that proof of intolerable working conditions compelling an employee to be absent may also support a finding of constructive suspension in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find reasonable a requirement that the employee alleging that her absence is caused by such conditions must inform the agency of the existence of the objectionable conditions, and must request assistance or remediation from the agency. No employee is entitled to leave work and remain absent without explanation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Freedman v. Veterans Administration</span>, 23 MSPR 361, 363-64 (1984) (appellant removed for abandonment of position had informed agency of alleged death threats causing him to leave work and not return; allegation sufficient to warrant jurisdictional hearing to rebut presumption of voluntary abandonment of position and show that absence was the result of a constructive removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the agency obviously must be put on notice of the specific nature of the conditions and the employee's inability to cope with them before it can be expected to investigate, attempt remediation of the conditions if necessary, or to consider finding other duties or positions for the employee pending resolution of the complaints. <span class="Italic">Cf. Thibodeaux,</span> 76 MSPR at 181; <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 MSPR at 639-40 (employee required to inform agency of medical condition and seek assistance from the agency).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the constructive retirement or resignation cases were inapposite because the appellants in such cases were no longer government employees. This is a distinction without a difference. The focus of our inquiry is not on the employee's current status, but on whether an appealable constructive personnel action resulted from coercion or duress imputable to the agency. We find that intolerable working conditions may render an absence from the workplace of more than 14 days involuntary, and thus appealable to the Board as a constructive suspension. To hold otherwise would force an employee faced with intolerable working conditions either to resign, retire, or endure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants' specific allegations of intolerable working conditions constitute nonfrivolous allegations of involuntary absences from duty. Each appellant contends that her absence was forced upon her because, for several years, Bailey's actions caused her such stress that she was unable to report for duty. Specifically, each appellant asserts that the employer-retained counseling service diagnosed that she would suffer emotional injury or harm if she returned to work alongside Bailey. Additionally, each of the appellants, except Audrey Myers, subsequently was advised by her individual psychiatrist that her symptoms would worsen and she would suffer injury or harm emotionally if she returned to work. Further, the appellants informed the agency that they would return to work if their medical conditions allowed and the intolerable working conditions were remedied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants further alleged that their supervisor abnegated his responsibility to check or address the situation allegedly caused by Bailey, leaving them without assistance in the health-threatening situation. Resolution of that allegation goes to the merits of the appeals, and must await determination following a finding of jurisdiction on remand.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleges that her absences beginning on August 18, 2008, were the result of psychological damage caused by intolerable working conditions. To establish jurisdiction over a constructive suspension on the basis of intolerable working conditions, an appellant must show that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to absent herself under the conditions and that the agency was culpable for these conditions. <span class="Italic">Peoples v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 5 (1999).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge concluded that, because the appellant did not request reassignment as a reasonable accommodation for her medical restrictions, she had a meaningful choice as to her absences, and therefore had not been constructively suspended. However, a medical absence may be attributable to intolerable working conditions regardless of whether the employee subsequently requests accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. If the conditions are such that a reasonable person would feel compelled to absent herself, and the agency is culpable for those conditions, to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntary absence from duty, it is suffi cient for the appellant to notify the agency that she is medically incapable of returning to duty in her current work environment. <span class="italic">See Peoples</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the appeal of Ms. Savage returned to the Board on her PFR.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">The appellant established that she was constructively suspended.</span></p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). Although various fact patterns may give rise to an appealable constructive suspension, all constructive suspension claims have two things in common: (1) the employee lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived the employee of that choice. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 11. Thus, to establish Board jurisdiction over an alleged constructive suspension based on intolerable working conditions, the appellant must show both that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to absent herself under the conditions and that the agency was culpable for those conditions. <span class="italic">Id.</span>; <span class="italic">Peoples v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999). The issue of voluntariness is distinct from the issue of the agency's culpability. <span class="italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that the incidents in question, taken singly or together, were not of sufficient severity that a reasonable person would have been compelled to stop reporting for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the parties and their respective medical witnesses are in agreement that, beginning on August 18, 2008, and continuing through her removal, the appellant was medically incapacitated from returning to her workplace. Under these circumstances, we must conclude that the appellant's absences were involuntary. <span class="italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 13 (rejecting the notion that "working outside medical restrictions is somehow a viable option for federal employees"); <span class="italic">see also Moore v.

Hence, whether the appellant suffered a constructive suspension turns on the element of culpability, i.e., whether her incapacitation and resulting absences are attributable to wrongful actions by the agency. <span class="italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 11.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;To establish the agency's culpability, the appellant must show, at minimum, that she put the agency on notice of the objectionable working conditions and requested assistance or remediation <span id="Page_2111"></span>from the agency. <span class="italic">Wegener v.

The required notice need not take the form of a request for accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 21. Nonetheless, the agency must be put on notice of the specific nature of the conditions and the employee's inability to cope with them before it can be expected to investigate, attempt remediation of the conditions if necessary, or to consider finding other duties or positions for the employee pending resolution of the complaints. <span class="italic">Peoples</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 217, &#x00B6; 9. Hence, the agency's knowledge of the intolerable working conditions, whether actual or constructive, must be shown to establish a culpable connection between the objectionable conditions and the agency's duty--if any--to alleviate the conditions. <span class="italic">Id.</span> We agree with the appellant that she provided the required notice and request for remediation in her August 2008 contact with the agency's EEO office, in which she described in detail numerous incidents of alleged harassment and specifically requested that the agency put an end to what she viewed as a hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency is culpable for subjecting the appellant to the hostile work environment that resulted in her incapacitation, we conclude that her absence from August 18, 2008, until her removal, constituted a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. We further find that the suspension action cannot be sustained, because it was effected without minimum due process, i.e., notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="italic">See Mc Lain v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). Because the suspension action must be reversed regardless of the outcome on remand, we order the agency to cancel the action and provide appropriate back pay and benefits, if any, for the period from August 18, 2008, to her removal. <span class="italic">See Martin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 14 (2016); <span class="italic">Mc Lain</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">We do not sustain the charge of AWOL in the removal action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the agency based its removal action on three charges: excessive absences, unavailability for duty with no foreseeable end, and AWOL. In our previous remand order, we determined that the agency failed to prove the charge of excessive absences, but did establish the charge of unavailability for duty with no foreseeable end. <span class="italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-34. Concerning the charge of AWOL, we noted that finding that the appellant had been constructively suspended during the period she was charged AWOL would mean that her absences resulted from the agency's wrongful actions. <span class="italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 29. In such a case, it would have been unreasonable for the agency to deny the appellant's request for leave to cover those absences. <span class="italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, we directed that, if the administrative judge determined on remand that the appellant was constructively suspended during the period for which she was charged AWOL, the charge should not be sustained. <span class="italic">Id.</span> We have here found, contrary to the remand initial decision, that the appellant was constructively suspended. Accordingly, we do not sustain the AWOL charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge concluded that, because the appellant did not request reassignment as a reasonable accommodation for her medical restrictions, she had a meaningful choice as to her absences, and therefore had not been constructively suspended. However, a medical absence may be attributable to intolerable working conditions regardless of whether the employee subsequently requests accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. If the conditions are such that a reasonable person would feel compelled to absent herself, and the agency is culpable for those conditions, to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntary absence from duty, it is sufficient for the appellant to notify the agency that she is medically incapable of returning to duty in her current work environment. <span class="Italic">See Peoples</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Moore v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant asserted that she worked alone much of the day at a secluded facility, and that one of her customers stalked her. The appellant has also asserted that the stalking caused her so much stress that she was unable to report for duty, and has presented her physician's statement that anxiety caused by her working conditions rendered her unable to work. Further, the appellant's psychologist subsequently diagnosed the appellant with PTSD as a result of her working conditions and recommended a transfer away from the Diamond Post Office as a remedy. The appellant has also alleged that she notified her supervisor of the problem, and told the agency that she could perform any and all of her duties in another location. We find that these specific allegations of intolerable working conditions constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntary absence from duty. <span class="Italic">See Wegner</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Peoples</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 108 MSPR 398, 400-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5-7, 2008 MSPB 68 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal with the Board and requested a hearing, alleging that the agency's actions constituted a constructive suspension. The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order advising the parties that the Board may lack jurisdiction over the appeal and ordering the appellant to file evidence and argument to prove that the action is within the Board's jurisdiction. The appellant responded, asserting that she had been subject to a constructive suspension or removal within the Board's appellate jurisdiction because she allegedly had been "locked out of her job for the past nine months (relegated to licking stamps)" and because her supervisor "verbally and mentally abused [her] by yelling at her, belittling her, silencing her, and ostracizing her," placing her "under such extreme stress that she was forced to take a total of 158.50 hours of sick leave and approximately 350 hours of annual leave." She also alleged that the agency failed to restore her clinical privileges retroactively, which resulted in a gap in her clinical privileges that was "tantamount to an adverse action" within the Board's appellate jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(2). The agency moved to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the appellant's claims were both moot and beyond the scope of the Board's appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1); <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Mills v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). In addition, if an employee has been forced to use sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay for a period exceeding 14 days, she has been subjected to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Dixon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 171, 175 (1995). Ordinarily, the key question for jurisdictional purposes is whether the employee or the agency initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Mills,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 6. If the absence is involuntary, i.e., at the direction of the agency, then the employee has been constructively suspended, but a voluntary absence is not a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.; Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 691-92 (1996). Constructive suspension claims generally arise in two situations: (1) when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry pending her ability to perform; or (2) when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Hamiel v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 497, &#x00B6; 4 (2007). Proof of intolerable working conditions compelling an employee to be absent, however, may also support a finding of a constructive suspension in certain circumstances where the employee also shows that she put the agency on notice of the objectionable working conditions and requested assistance or remediation from the agency. <span class="Italic">See Peoples v. Department of the Navy,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-11 (1999) (employees made non-frivolous allegations of involuntary absences from duty where each contended that her absence was forced upon her because a co-worker's actions caused her such stress that she was unable to report for duty; that she would suffer emotional injury or harm if she returned to work; and that she had informed the agency that she would return to work if her medical condition allowed and the intolerable working conditions were remedied); <span class="Italic">accord Wegener v. Department of the Interior,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 8 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant indicated that she was challenging a constructive suspension. She asserted that, as the result of her supervisor's verbal and mental abuse, she was placed under such extreme stress that she was forced to take in excess of 14 days of annual and sick leave, and, in support of her allegations, provided her sworn affidavit. The appellant also alleged that she "ha[s] been unfairly suspended from performing my duties as [Clinical Director] from November 15, 2006 to at least July 11, 2007," that she has been "relegated to licking stamps," and that the agency "refuses to return her to her position as Clinical Director."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegations and supporting documentation were enough to require the administrative judge to issue a notice informing her of the elements of a constructive suspension claim. An appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The administrative judge's jurisdictional order, however, did not provide the appellant with explicit information concerning what was required to establish Board jurisdiction over a constructive suspension claim. Although the agency's motion to dismiss addressed the appellant's constructive suspension claim, it did not notify her of the elements of proof necessary to establish jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Peoples.</span> Thus, we find it necessary to remand this appeal to afford the appellant an opportunity to submit evidence and argument to show that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal as a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Wegener,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 13 (remanding appeal with instructions to advise the appellant of the elements of a constructive suspension claim based on intolerable working conditions under <span class="Italic">Peoples</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Mills,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 9 (remanding constructive suspension appeal with instructions to provide <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice).

<p class="Body-Text">Idleness of an employee, coupled with some difficulties experienced with supervisors, may not equate to the type of working environment that converts a period of absence into a constructive suspension. In <span class="Italic">Gerges v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 669, 673-79 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-20 (2001), involving both a constructive suspension claim and an appeal from a discharge imposed for the excessive absence encompassed by the suspension appeal, the Board stated of an employee who was geographically reassigned and found himself idled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During about the first 15 months of his employment at BNAS, the appellant was assigned to work for Dale Mosher, Manager of the Solid Waste Branch of the Environmental Division. There seems to be no doubt that the appellant was not kept busy during this time. The appellant testified without contradiction that he watched television much of that time and that other employees performed the work he believed he should have been assigned. We note, however, that the involuntariness standard stated in <span class="Italic">Peoples</span> and the other cases cited above is a high one, and that it requires the courts and the Board to focus on whether the agency "render[ed] the workplace so pervasively unpleasant and difficult" that the employee was "deprived...of any other choice but to quit." <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 522. Nothing in the record indicates that the agency did more, during the 15-month period described above, to make the appellant's working conditions difficult than to fail to assign him sufficient work. Under these circumstances, it is doubtful that the standard in <span class="Italic">Peoples</span> would be met even if that failure constituted a deliberate attempt to deprive the appellant of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the agency's failure to assign the appellant sufficient work during the period at issue here does not appear to have resulted from inappropriate agency motives. The Director of the Environmental Division, Gregory Apraham, indicated that the agency felt when the appellant arrived that he did not have the training and expertise to perform the environmental duties assigned to him at the time he came to BNAS; and he and Mr. Mosher testified without contradiction that the appellant received training in this area after he arrived at the installation. This evidence strongly suggests that the appellant's insufficient work resulted from a perception that he could not perform the work that otherwise would have been assigned to him, rather than from a deliberate effort to make the appellant's working conditions difficult. We note further that the appellant does not appear to have done anything during this period to bring the insufficiency of his work assignments to the attention of anyone at the agency. Even when he was assigned to another supervisor, James Caruthers, in October 1996, it was the new supervisor, and not the appellant, who brought up the problem.... The appellant's failure to seek a remedy during this time further distinguishes the appellant's situation from circumstances the Board has found to be coercive<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 523 (appellant "did not resign until she pursued many grievances and two complaints").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the 15-month period described above ended about 20 months before the appellant's absence from work began, and more than 2 years before the unauthorized absence on which the removal was based began. For this reason, and for the other reasons stated above, we see nothing in the agency's actions during this 15-month period that provides significant support to a finding that the agency's actions improperly compelled the appellant's absence from work on and after June 23, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding of harassment was based to a large extent on the actions of Mr. Caruthers, the branch manager who, except for the 5-month detail mentioned above, supervised the appellant from October 1996 until early March 1998. Specifically, the administrative judge found that Mr. Caruthers had acted improperly by requiring the appellant to keep a log of his telephone calls and a diary of his work-related activities; by criticizing the appellant orally and in writing; by attempting to lower his performance rating and alter the rating communicated during a prior progress review; by having him escorted off the base by security officials on February 26, 1998, after the appellant insisted on photocopying his work before turning it in; and by proposing to suspend him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's relationship with Mr. Caruthers clearly was difficult, and Mr. Caruthers may have acted inappropriately with respect to some of the matters on which the administrative judge relied. As the administrative judge has noted, however, Mr. Caruthers resigned on or about March 6, 1998. We cannot find, under these circumstances, that the appellant had no reasonable alternative to absenting himself from work beginning on June 23, 1998, nearly 7 weeks after Mr. Caruthers had left the agency<span class="Italic">. A fortiori</span>, the absence on which the appellant's removal was based--an absence that did not begin until well over 9 months after Mr. Caruthers's resignation--cannot be said to have been coerced by that official's actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding of harassment also is based, to some extent, on certain actions of Mr. Apraham, i.e., on actions that official took with respect to a test the appellant failed and was required to retake, on Mr. Apraham's decision to impose the 2-day suspension Mr. Caruthers had proposed as well as the subsequent 5-day suspension proposed by Mr. Mosher, on his returning the appellant to Mr. Caruthers's supervision in January 1998 "without assignment of duties and responsibilities commensurate with the Chemist position," and on his cancellation of a trip that the appellant was scheduled to take in late April 1998 to attend a conference in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the test mentioned above, the administrative judge found that Mr. Apraham "clearly used a lax examination process as a pretext to cause an already stressed employee further distress." We disagree. Whether the examination process was "lax" or not, both it and the training that preceded it was administered by a private vendor, and it was the vendor, and not the agency, that concluded that the appellant had failed the test. It also is undisputed that the appellant and other employees were required to pass the test in order to obtain the certificates they needed to perform their duties; Mr. Apraham telephoned the vendor at the appellant's request after the appellant had failed the test; and, as a result of this call, the appellant was permitted to take the test again. Moreover, although Mr. Apraham evidently decided that the appellant's second attempt to pass the test could not be the basis for certification, his decision appears quite reasonable. That official testified, and the appellant acknowledged, that the second test was identical to the first, and that the appellant simply copied the corrected answers from his first test while he was taking the second test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The suspensions mentioned above also do not suggest to us that Mr. Apraham treated the appellant unfairly. While the administrative judge stated that the 2-day suspension was based on a failure "to perform the most minor tasks on [a] list of 13 items" previously given to the appellant, and while none of the three tasks at issue in this suspension appear to be particularly time-consuming, each of the tasks appears to be have concerned the appellant's obligation to provide information needed to perform or evaluate important testing or analysis. In each of the three instances on which the suspension was based, the appellant is said to have failed to provide information he had been repeatedly requested to provide, and in one instance the initial request is described as "urgent."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Mr. Apraham's returning the appellant to Mr. Caruthers's supervision in early 1998 does not appear unreasonable. While it is clear that the appellant was not happy with the duties he was expected to perform, the record contains persuasive evidence that the appellant's dissatisfaction was based not on the amount of work he was assigned, but on the nature of that work. The union official who accompanied the appellant to meetings, and who otherwise attempted to negotiate with the agency on the appellant's behalf, testified that the appellant wished to have a chemist job similar to the one he had in Philadelphia, i.e., a job as an analytical chemist "in a place where they have test tubes and bunsen burners, and things like that." The appellant's position in the Environmental Division did not have such responsibilities, however. Instead, it was a position in which the appellant was responsible for taking samples of materials, for sending the samples to an outside laboratory for analysis, and for performing other duties that, although requiring a chemistry background, were essentially administrative. The appellant felt that the sampling duties could be performed by people with less expertise in chemistry than he had; he preferred to perform the analysis himself; he expressed an aversion to "push[ing] paper"; and he was perceived by management as having difficulties handling the administrative work he was assigned. It is the employing agency, however, that is responsible for deciding what positions it needs and what duties it should assign to those positions<span class="Italic">. See LaBonte v. Department of Commerce</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 534, 537 (1984). We cannot conclude that the agency acted unreasonably in requiring the appellant to perform the duties it assigned to him, or that its assignment of those duties supports a finding that the appellant's absence from work was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining action by Mr. Apraham on which the administrative judge relied, i.e., the cancellation of the appellant's trip to Washington, also provides no significant support for a finding that the appellant's absence was involuntary. That trip evidently was scheduled to begin within a few days after the appellant finished serving the second of his two suspensions. It is not unreasonable, in our view, for an agency to decide that an employee who had been suspended twice during the preceding 3-1/2 months should not represent his organization at a conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found that the "agency did nothing to assist the appellant in resolving...his medical situation and returning to work," and that it acted unfairly in denying the appellant's requests for advanced sick leave and leave without pay. We disagree. Although the appellant submitted medical evidence in support of his leave requests, nothing in that evidence or elsewhere in the record indicates that the appellant expected, or was expected by his physician, to be able to return to work in the foreseeable future. Moreover, by the time <span id="Page_2113"></span>the agency proposed the appellant's removal, it had permitted the appellant to use all his sick and annual leave; it had granted him nearly 3 months of unpaid leave; Denise Spliethof, an agency employee from whom the appellant sought assistance in connection with a claim for unemployment compensation, had informed the appellant's supervisor that the appellant did not intend to return to the Environmental Division; and agency personnel specialists had made unsuccessful efforts to identify suitable vacancies elsewhere in BNAS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the appellant has not shown that the agency compelled him to absent himself on and after June 23, 1998, and that he therefore has not shown that his absence constituted a constructive suspension. Moreover, it is undisputed that the appellant was absent without leave during the part of that period on which the agency relied in removing the appellant, i.e., from December 22, 1998, until January 14, 1999. We therefore SUSTAIN the charge of excessive unauthorized absence during that period, and we find that the Board has no jurisdiction over the appellant's absence from June 23, 1998, through the effective date of his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Caveney v. Office of Admin.</span>, 57 MSPR 667 (1993) (discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-058.html#sec6-59">Involuntary Reassignment</a>").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Trobovic v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/06-3341p.pdf">232 Fed. Appx. 958</a>, 963-64 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), resolved that allegations were jurisdictionally insufficient to establish an enforced leave case arising out of an allegedly hostile working environment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge next addressed Mr. Trobovic's allegation that a hostile work environment forced him to absent himself from his workplace and therefore led to his placement in nonpay, nonduty status. In response to the administrative judge's order to show cause for finding Board jurisdiction, Mr. Trobovic submitted a sworn pleading setting forth several attributes of his work environment. Specifically, Mr. Trobovic alleged that he had an unmanageable workload; that his supervisor, Mr. Wallace, gave a promotion to another employee instead of Mr. Trobovic; that a co-worker used insulting language to refer to him in the presence of other co-workers and contractors; that Mr. Wallace accused Mr. Trobovic of criminal activity at the behest of disgruntled members of the charitable organization on whose board Mr. Trobovic serves; and that Mr. Wallace humiliated Mr. Trobovic by directing him "to report to non-supervisory co-workers and/or contract employees."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address any of those allegations. Rather, the administrative judge picked out Mr. Trobovic's introductory statement that he intended to demonstrate a hostile work environment and rested at finding that statement conclusory. That failure to examine Mr. Trobovic's specific factual allegations was improper. <span class="Italic">Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1344 ("[I]f indeed the administrative judge decided that Ms. Garcia's allegations were frivolous, this court requires that the Board further elaborate on its decision by providing some specificity.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, we find that the Board's dismissal was proper on another basis: The alleged facts do not rise to the level of working conditions so intolerable that "a reasonable person confronted with the same circumstances would feel coerced" into leaving the workplace. The conduct that Mr. Trobovic identifies, while regrettable if it occurred, is not sufficiently severe or pervasive to satisfy the demanding legal standard of proving that the GSA intentionally created a hostile work environment that would have coerced an employee in Mr. Trobovic's circumstances to absent himself from work. <span class="Italic">See Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1329 ("[T]he doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one[,] requiring that the employee satisfy a demanding legal standard." (quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">cf. Williams v. Giant Food Inc.,</span> 370 F.3d 423, 434 (4th Cir. 2004) (holding that working conditions were not intolerable to the point of coercion where "supervisors yelled at employee, told her she was a poor manager, gave her poor performance evaluations, chastised her in front of customers, and once required her to work with an injured back"); <span class="Italic">Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher &#x0026; Co.,</span> 164 F.3d 1151, 1159-60 (8th Cir. 1999) (stating that "a feeling of being unfairly criticized or having to endure difficult or unpleasant working conditions" would not coerce an employee to leave a workplace, even where the unpleasantness involved a supervisor fondling his genitals in front of the employee and using inappropriate language with her).</p>
