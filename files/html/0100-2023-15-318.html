<p class="Body-Text">Removal is justified for an employee whose physical (or mental) condition leaves him incapable of performing the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 666 F.2d 258 (5th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-4324-14-0611-I-1 (NP 9/21/2015) ("Generally, removal for physical inability to perform the essential functions of a position promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 18 (2014) (involving a removal for physical inability to perform from a position not subject to medical evaluation programs)."); <span class="Italic">Sims v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 607 (1982) (removal from a distribution clerk position because of a heart condition). Refer to OPM regulations on medical qualification determinations at 5 CFR Part 339 (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fox v. Dept. of Army</span>, 120 MSPR 529, 543-44, 549-50, 552-53, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-26, 34, 40, 2014 MSPB 6 (2014), outlined the requisites of a removal based on inability to perform the essential functions of a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency proved the charge of inability to perform</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her analysis of the first charge, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Slater v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 11 (2008), for the proposition that, in order to remove an employee for physical inability to perform, the agency must show that the disabling condition itself is disqualifying, its recurrence cannot be ruled out, and the duties of the position are such that a recurrence would pose a reasonable probability of substantial harm. The holding of <span class="Italic">Slater</span> is derived from OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206, which concerns disqualifications based on medical history from positions with medical standards or physical requirements or subject to medical evaluation programs. The appellant did not occupy such a position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 339.202, .203, .205. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Slater</span> does not govern this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the appellant does not occupy a position with medical standards or physical requirements or subject to medical evaluation programs, in order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform, the agency must prove a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 10 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 122 Fed. Appx. 513 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In other words, the agency must establish that the appellant's medical condition prevents her from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 13. In determining whether the agency has met its burden, the Board will consider whether a reasonable accommodation exists that would enable the appellant to safely and efficiently perform those core duties. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10. However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified; whether it could do so goes to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination and/or the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Rehabilitation Act requires an agency to provide reasonable accommodation to a qualified individual with an actual disability or a record of a disability. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(4).[5] With exceptions not applicable here, the term "qualified" means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education and other job-related requirements of the employment position the individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). It is undisputed and amply clear from the record that the appellant is a person with a disability as defined at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(i). However, as discussed above, the appellant cannot perform all essential functions of her position even with reasonable accommodation. Moreover, the record reflects that the agency could not accommodate the appellant by reassigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified. Because the appellant is not a qualified individual with a disability under <span class="Italic">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m),</span> her claim of disability discrimination based on failure to accommodate fails.</p>

Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6; 11 (2008), for the proposition that, in order to remove an employee for physical inability to perform, the agency must show that the disabling condition itself is disqualifying, its recurrence cannot be ruled out, and the duties of the position are such that a recurrence would pose a reasonable probability of substantial harm. Because the appellant did not hold a position with medical standards or physical requirements subject to medical evaluation <span id="Page_2853"></span>programs, <span class="Italic">Slater</span> does not govern this appeal. <span class="Italic">Fox v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, in order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform in this matter, the agency must prove a nexus between the employees medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that his condition may result in injury to himself or others.

However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning him to a vacant position for which he was qualified; whether it could do so goes to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination or the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The core duties of a position are synonymous with its essential functions, i.e., the fundamental job duties of the position, not including marginal functions. <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 26; <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues on review that the administrative judge failed to consider the appellant's position description, which showed that "effective, timely, and accurate verbal communication" was a crucial part of the position. We agree. In the notice of proposed removal charging the appellant with inability to perform, the proposing official stated that the appellant was "unable to perform the functional requirements essential to the duties of [his] position. The proposing official also stated, "The essential functions of the Supervisory Public Safety Dispatcher include significant verbal communication. Full performance of this function is essential to the mission of the agency." The deciding official reiterated these statements in his decision letter, including his consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In his consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the deciding official stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Due to a severe and long term medical condition, Mr. Clemens cannot perform his duty functions on a regular, full time basis. These functions are essential to the accomplishment of the DES mission.

<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 308 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's position description, his "Major Duties" included possible performance of Public Safety Dispatcher duties, such as providing "emergency police, fire and medical services to the public by answering emergency 911 calls and responding with appropriate personnel and equipment" and "Advanced Emergency Medical Dispatch Life Support through pre-arrival instruction to callers. The appellant was required to spend 25% of his time on duties related to caller interrogation, including "crisis intervention with distraught emergency callers during high-risk situations" and "dispatch[ing] a variety of emergency equipment to include police, fire, ambulance, Med-Evac, rescue or hazardous materials unit." He also was required to provide emergency medical dispatching assistance to callers with medical emergencies, including the responsibility to initiate "immediate, appropriate, emergency response" and to provide "advanced life support," such as instructing callers on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the Heimlich maneuver, or emergency childbirth and how to open an airway or control bleeding. In such situations, he was required to maintain "continuous telephone contact" with the caller and give instructions "regarding what to do, and what not to do, prior to the arrival of pre-hospital care providers." Further, a knowledge requirement for the position was "the ability to communicate orally." Thus, we find that significant verbal communication was an essential function of the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we discuss below, the appellant did not suggest or request an accommodation.[6] <span class="Italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25, 28.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no error in the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant is an individual with a disability because he was substantially limited in the major life activity of communicating. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). The administrative judge did not make a finding, however, concerning whether the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability; that is, whether he could perform the essential functions of his position, or a vacant funded position to which he could be assigned, with or without reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); <span class="Italic">see Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 53 (1998). In this regard, the appellant did not present any evidence to support his argument that he could perform the essential duties of his position with or without an accommodation. The medical records from his physicians are conclusory and unspecific as they merely suggest that the appellant might be accommodated through "text to voice." (indicating that "[p]erhaps text to voice" would accommodate the appellant). Additionally, the appellant did not provide any argument about or evidence of his ability to perform in a vacant funded position to which he could have been assigned. Thus, the evidence before us does not support a finding that the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the agency did not fail to provide a reasonable accommodation because the appellant neither requested accommodation nor adequately provided information concerning <span id="Page_2854"></span>his ability to return to his position with an accommodation. A disability discrimination claim will fail if the employee never requested accommodation while employed. <span class="Italic">Paris v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (2006). Nonetheless, an employee only has a general responsibility to inform his employer that he needs accommodation for a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once he has done so, the employer must engage in the interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant informed the agency of his physical limitations during the recovery period and requested to be advanced leave and placed in the leave donation program. The agency advanced 240 hours of sick leave and placed the appellant in the leave donation program. On June 13, 2011, the agency issued a formal request for medical documentation. In response, the appellant submitted two medical evaluation forms completed by his physicians, dated June 21, 2011, and June 24, 2011. It does not appear that the appellant submitted any other medical documentation to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that the medical evaluation forms contained his request for an accommodation and that the agency failed to meet its obligation to engage in the interactive process. In response to the question on the medical evaluation form concerning what specific accommodation would be required for the appellant to perform the essential functions of his position, Dr. Tim Mikesell responded, "He has difficulty [with] speech," and Dr. Andrey Lev-Weissberg responded, "Perhaps text to voice." (the appellant indicated that these were requests for accommodation). In response to the question of what type of work the appellant could perform within his medical restrictions, if he was not able to perform the essential functions of his current position, Dr. Mikesell responded, "A position without significant talking." (the appellant indicated that "this would be reassignment"). Dr. Lev-Weissberg responded, "His speech is affected so I do not know what other devices are available to help [with] verbal communication. Typing or other secretarial work is ok." The appellant does not point to any other evidence indicating that he requested accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the statements in the above documents do not constitute a request for an accommodation. The statements made by the appellant's doctors were terse and unspecific answers to the medical documentation questionnaire sent by the agency and would require the agency to extrapolate an intent to request accommodation and return to work. There is no indication in the record that the appellant expressed an intent or desire to return to his position at any point prior to his removal. In fact, in his response to the agency's proposed removal, the appellant indicated that he submitted and requested a continuation of pay while he "continue[d] to recover from [his] stroke" and had applied for immediate disability retirement. He did not indicate that he believed he could perform the duties of his position, with or without accommodation, nor did he express a desire to return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in their witness statements from the appellant's equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint, the proposing and deciding officials stated that they had not received anything from the appellant or his doctor requesting reasonable accommodation, nor had they received information from the appellant's doctors about the appellant's work abilities. They also submitted affidavits, stating: "Mr. Clemens made no request for a reasonable accommodation. The appellant points to the language in the EEO witness inquiry in which the proposing official "stated the aggrieved could have been provided something for his speech." This statement, however, does not demonstrate that the appellant requested accommodation prior to his removal or that the agency could have reasonably accommodated him. <span class="Italic">See Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-21 &#x0026; n.2 (finding that the appellant requested accommodation by promptly providing additional medical information on the nature of his disability and by indicating his interest in finding a reasonable accommodation, which was supported by record evidence including a declaration made under penalty of perjury).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if the appellant had requested reasonable accommodation, an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather, the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17. The appellant bears the burden of proving that an accommodation he seeks is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 24. His mere assertion that the agency could have allowed him to use computerized software is insufficient to meet his burden that such an accommodation existed and was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 13. Further, the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proving that there was a position the agency would have found and could have assigned to him if it had looked. <span class="Italic">See Nanette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 127, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 46 (2002).

Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 12 (2013). For the foregoing reasons, we find that the appellant failed to establish disability discrimination.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge noted that the agency did not argue in this case that there was a reasonable probability of hazard such that the appellant's condition could have resulted in injury to herself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that, in 2010, the new Commandant of Cadets determined that contested honor hearings would no longer be held in the OSJA courtroom out of a concern that holding such hearings in close proximity to the legal office made the proceedings more formal and legalistic. Based on that decision, the agency undertook numerous measures to modify the appellant's long-standing accommodation, but she refused them all. As set forth more fully below, we find that the evidence supports the agency's position and that, because the appellant cannot, or will not, perform the core duties of her position with the reasonable accommodation offered by the agency, the charge of inability to perform is sustained.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2855"></span>The administrative judge found that the appellant is an individual with a disability based on her testimony and supporting medical evidence showing that her medical impairment to her left knee significantly restricts her ability to walk, stand, and climb, substantially limiting her in those major life activities. The agency has not challenged that finding, and we discern no basis upon which to disturb it. Assuming without deciding that the appellant also established that she is a qualified individual with a disability under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m), i.e., that she can perform the essential functions of her position with or without accommodation, we now address whether the appellant established that the agency violated its duty of reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual with a disability may request a modification to the work environment or adjustments in how and when a job is performed, due to a medical condition. However, this request does not necessarily mean that the employer is required to provide the requested accommodation or adjustment. A request for reasonable accommodation is the first step in an informal, interactive process between the individual and the employer. EEOC Guidance (Requesting Reasonable Accommodation) (Q&#x0026;A item 1). "The appropriate reasonable accommodation is best determined through a flexible, interactive process that involves both the employer and the individual with a disability." Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, &#x00A7; 1630.9. Courts have generally required the parties to engage in this process in good faith. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rehling v. City of Chicago</span>, 207 F.3d 1009, 1015-16 (7th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see also Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 18 (2010) (finding that the appellant did not prove the denial of reasonable accommodation where he was unresponsive to the agency's good faith attempts to engage in the interactive process).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, after advising the appellant that it had been determined that contested honor hearings would no longer be held in the OSJA courtroom, the agency offered her an alternative accommodation whereby she would record and transcribe contested honor hearings in Washington Hall's Red Reeder Room. The agency believed that the appellant's restrictions would be accommodated because Washington Hall has an elevator. The agency also offered the appellant a parking pass, informed her that she would not have to carry any recording equipment, as the OSJA would ensure that such equipment would be in the Red Reeder Room on the days of her scheduled hearings, and offered to modify her work schedule by allowing her to have a later start time on those days. According to the appellant, she attempted to negotiate the steep incline at the entrance of Washington Hall, but encountered difficulty, aggravating her knee. The agency then proposed a modification to the previous accommodation, offering to purchase a mobility scooter for the appellant to insure that she would not injure herself trying to negotiate the ramp at Washington Hall. The agency scheduled three appointments for the appellant to visit a scooter store so that she could be trained and fitted with a scooter, but she indicated that she did not intend to appear at any of the appointments and, in fact, did not do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In August 2010, the appellant submitted a medical document indicating that she could not climb stairs, walk long distances, walk on inclines, or engage in prolonged standing. These restrictions had been in place for some time. However, the document submitted in August 2010 also stated "no mobility assistance scooter at this time." Because the document provided no medical basis for this statement, the agency unsuccessfully sought further information from the appellant's physician regarding the viability of the scooter. On December 17, 2012, the agency reviewed all of the documentation and determined that the appellant had refused the proposed modification of her accommodation by rejecting the mobility scooter offered to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 4, 2011, the agency notified the appellant that she was required to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination as it appeared that she was unable to access either of the authorized locations for contested cadet honor hearings. The examination determined that she was disqualified for further assignment to her present position based on her stated medical limitations. Because the appellant had declined a reasonable accommodation, that is, use of a scooter, the agency advised her that it would conduct a job search for a full-time permanent position for which she was qualified and which was within her medical limitations. In August 2011, having not found an eligible position at the appellant's current grade level of GS-7, the agency offered her the position of Legal Assistant, GS-6, with pay retention. She was advised that, if she failed to respond to the offer within 7 days of her receipt of it, the agency would initiate procedures to remove her. The appellant neither accepted nor declined the offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the appellant failed to engage in good faith in the interactive process. Rather, at each step of the way, she rejected or circumvented the agency's proposed and then revised offers, based on her own seemingly subjective belief that she could only be accommodated by continuing her old accommodation, absent any proof that this was the case. Although the appellant's physician indicated in August 2010 that she could not use a mobility assistance scooter "at this time," he testified at the hearing that he "regretted" putting that restriction on the form and that he was not aware of any medical reason why the appellant could not use a mobility assistance scooter. Moreover, in a form the appellant's doctor completed on her behalf on September 8, 2011, he stated that the appellant "may use scooter to go up and down ramp."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If more than one accommodation will enable an individual to perform the essential functions of her position, the preference of the individual with the disability should be given primary consideration, but the employer providing the accommodation has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations. Appendix to 29 C.F.R. Part 1630, &#x00A7; 1630.9. Under the circumstances, we find that the appellant failed to establish that the agency violated its duty of reasonable accommodation because she was not entitled to the accommodation of her choice and because the agency acted within its discretion to offer her reasonable and effective accommodations, all of which she declined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency-imposed penalty of removal falls within the limits of reasonableness</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the standard to be applied in cases involving removal for inability to perform is whether the penalty of removal exceeded "the tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 14 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 122 F. App'x 513 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The record reflects that the appellant's medical condition required long-term recovery and rehabilitation without a foreseeable end to her incapacity. Further, the medical documentation provided to the agency, which was often conclusory, did not support the appellant's ability to return to duty. After offering the appellant several forms of reasonable accommodation, but before imposing removal, however, the agency took the additional step of offering her a lower-graded position with saved pay. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marshall-Carter</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 14 (an agency did not abuse its discretion when assessing the reasonableness of the penalty by failing to consider reassignment as an alternative to removal, where the appellant refused to cooperate with the agency's attempts to determine the extent of her physical limitations). In addition, we have pointed out that the appellant has certain obligations during the interactive reasonable accommodation process and that the penalty of removal may be justified where the appellant falls short of those obligations. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 54 (1998) (removal for physical inability to perform sustained where appellant failed to identify any vacant funded positions at or below her grade level the duties of which she could perform) (citing <span class="Italic">Gonzagowski v. Widnall</span>, 115 F.3d 744, 748-49 (10th Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Shiring v. Runyon</span>, 90 F.3d 827, 832 (3d Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Runyon</span>, 987 F. Supp. 620, 622 (N.D. Ohio 1997)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter</span>, and in light of the appellant's repeated refusals to accept any of the agency's numerous offers of reasonable accommodation, we find, under the circumstances, that the penalty of removal falls within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.[5] <span class="Italic">See Beard v. General Services Administration</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (when an agency's penalty is not unreasonable, it must be accorded deference by the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;With its petition for review, the agency has submitted a copy of a February 27, 2013 decision of a New York State Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board administrative law judge denying the appellant unemployment benefits on the basis that she voluntarily quit her job without good cause at the agency. Specifically, the administrative law judge found that, because the appellant declined the agency's offer of a lower-graded position, she was disqualified from receiving benefits. The unemployment benefits decision was issued after the initial decision in this case, and therefore it is new evidence. <span class="Italic">See Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). However, while unemployment compensation decisions are worthy of consideration, they are not dispositive. <span class="Italic">Cirella v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 19, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 296 F. App'x 63 (2008). Because, in applying the principle of <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter</span> to the circumstances presented in this case, we have found that the agency did not need to consider the appellant for other positions as an alternative to removal, the unemployment compensation decision is not material. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980). We therefore deny the appellant's request, filed 8 months after the close of the record on review, to submit a copy of a decision which, she contends, reversed the administrative law judge's decision.</p>

NASA</span>, DA-0752-13-0291-I-1 (NP 8/21/2014), related medical ability to perform a position with the core functions of a job not subject to medical standards and determined that the agency breached no accommodative duty by removing the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a charge of physical inability to perform in a position that does not have medical standards or physical requirements, and is not subject to medical evaluation programs, an agency is required to prove a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given <span id="Page_2856"></span>the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. <span class="Italic">Fox v.

In other words, the agency must establish that the appellant's medical condition prevents her from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining if the agency has met its burden, the Board will consider whether a reasonable accommodation exists that would enable the appellant to safely and efficiently perform those core duties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified; whether it could do so goes to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination and/or reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge found that the agency proved that, due to her medical restrictions, the appellant was unable to perform the required duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in her petition for review that the medical documentation reviewed by the agency's Medical Director was not current and did not reflect her current medical treatment. The medical documentation relied on by the agency's Medical Director in his determination was dated from July through September 2011. The appellant alleges that the Medical Director was not aware of how she was responding to treatment that began in July 2011. However, she provided no medical documentation in 2012 or 2013 to reflect that her restrictions had changed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Medical Director provided an affidavit regarding his determination, in July 2012, that the appellant could not perform the essential functions of her position, and that no reasonable accommodations were available. The Medical Director based his determination on the appellant's position description requirements, and the medical documentation the appellant provided when making a work accommodation request through the agency's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office. The appellant was diagnosed with multiple autoimmune and hereditary disorders that result in weakness and fatigue, muscle spasms, and falls due to weakness in her extremities, requiring absences from work when her conditions flare up. Of particular focus by the Medical Director was the form dated August 17, 2011, completed by the appellant's treating physician. The appellant's doctor noted a number of symptoms and diagnoses regarding the appellant's condition, that the appellant was incapacitated beginning on July 19, 2011, and that the doctor did not provide an end date for the condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The core duties of a position are synonymous with its essential functions, i.e., the fundamental job duties of the position, not including marginal functions. <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 26 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1)). A job duty may be considered essential for any of several reasons, e.g., because the reason the position exists is to perform that function, because of the limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that job function can be distributed, or because the function is highly specialized so that the incumbent is hired for his or her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 26 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(2)). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential includes, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential, written job descriptions, the amount of time spent on the job performing the function, and the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function. <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 26 (citing 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(3)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In charging the appellant with inability to perform, the Deputy Chief Financial Officer indicated that the Accounting Technician in the Travel Accounting Group possessed the following essential functions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]o process the authorizations and expense reports through the Funds Certifier queue (the first queue in the travel system) and to serve as back up to the funding queue (the last queue in the travel system). These travel queues must be worked proactively throughout the day to ensure there is not a work stoppage in travel processing. The Travel Accounting Group is a highly visible customer service organization, so the work required by your position is important to the success of our mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his affidavit, the agency's Medical Director defined the appellant's job duties as "being responsible for examining, verifying, and maintaining a variety of time-critical travel documents, authorizations, and expense reports. Her position also required extensive interface and communication with customers and other team members during normal work hours." Neither party submitted a copy of the appellant's position description. The appellant has not challenged the agency's description of her job duties, therefore, we consider those duties to be the core duties of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has established a nexus between the appellant's medical condition and observed deficiencies in performance. The appellant's last performance appraisal completed by the agency covered the period of May 1, 2010, to April 30, 2011. Although the agency has not provided a more recent performance evaluation, the agency did submit evidence describing the consequences of the appellant's absences. The Chief of the Financial Services Branch submitted an affidavit regarding the adverse impact the appellant's absences have had on the organization. The Chief's affidavit references the additional time she was required to spend addressing the appellant's inquiries that could have been spent on other issues, along with the need for others in the unit having to do the appellant's duties when she was absent. The agency also submitted the Chief's letter to human resources regarding the appellant. In that letter, the Chief addressed how the appellant's absences have made it difficult to manage the work of the office and have affected other employees who were required to back her up in her absence. The Chief also addressed the appellant's communication skills and need for improvement. The Chief stated that the appellant had difficulty communicating with her management, team lead, coworkers, and customers, resulting in errors and additional work to resolve. The agency's removal proposal contained similar information regarding the difficulty the appellant had in performing tasks and communicating with her management and team. The proposal also referenced that her position required extensive interaction with customers and coworkers and that her inability to perform her position placed a severe burden on the remaining employees who had to cover her work. We find the agency's evidence sufficient to establish that the appellant's absences had a negative effect not only on her performance, but also on the work group as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 2012, the attorney representing the appellant in her EEO complaint submitted two emails to the agency regarding the appellant and her potential to return to work. In the first email, the attorney stated the appellant would not be able to return to work the next day due to her medical conditions. The attorney stated that the appellant would return to work when she was able to do so. The following day, the appellant's attorney sent a second email, which stated that the appellant would not be able to work for a period of time and that the appellant would provide medical documentation for the absence. There is no evidence in the record that the appellant ever provided the promised medical documentation for this absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For approximately 1 year prior to her removal, the appellant had the opportunity to provide the agency with medical documentation that she could return to work and perform the duties of her position with accommodation. However, she failed to provide any medical documentation even when notified of her potential removal. The record contains no evidence to suggest there was any foreseeable end to the appellant's absence. The Board has previously held that when the appellant is unavailable for duty due to her incapacitation and the unavailability has no foreseeable end, then removal of the employee is warranted. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 4 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 15 (2008)). Here, the record did not suggest a foreseeable end to the appellant's inability to return to work. Therefore, we find that the agency proved the charge of inability to perform by preponderant evidence, and also proved the nexus of the charge to the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The penalty of removal was reasonable and promotes the efficiency of the service.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, removal for physical inability to perform the essential functions of a position promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">D'Leo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 44, 51 (1992). At the time of her removal, the appellant had over 20 years of service. For approximately a 1-year period up to her removal, the appellant did not provide evidence demonstrating her ability to return to work as required by the agency. The appellant did not provide medical evidence in response to the proposal to remove her despite the 3 1/2 month period between the issuance of the proposal notice and notice of the decision to remove. Nor did she provide any evidence of her ability to perform her duties in the context of the instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining if removal is an appropriate penalty, the Board will consider whether the appellant could have been assigned to a vacant position within her medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 14. However, as discussed above, the record demonstrates that reassignment was not feasible. Based on the appellant's inability to perform the essential functions of the position and the lack of a foreseeable end to her inability to return to work, her removal will promote the efficiency of the service, and the penalty is sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not prove her affirmative defense that the agency engaged in disability discrimination</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant was an individual with a disability, but concluded that she was not "qualified," and that the agency did not remove her based on her disability. The appellant alleged disability discrimination based on denial of a reasonable accommodation. The Rehabilitation Act requires an agency to provide reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations <span id="Page_2857"></span>of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that accommodation would cause an undue hardship on its business operations. <span class="Italic">Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 10 (2014). With exceptions not applicable here, the term "qualified" means that the individual satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position the individual holds or desires and, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential duties of such position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Reasonable accommodation includes modifications to the manner in which a position is customarily performed to enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential job functions, or reassignment of the employee to a vacant position whose duties the employee can perform. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden to show that she is a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">Henson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). We agree with the administrative judge that she has not done so. The appellant submitted a request for reasonable accommodation to the agency and provided medical information in support of her request. The appellant requested to be absent for infusions four times a month for a period of 6 days per occurrence, not to have to return to work on the days of the infusions, to be absent when flare-ups occurred, and to be able to make up those missed hours. The agency responded to the appellant's accommodation request, approving some requests for a 6-month trial period, and also requested that the Medical Director review the documentation to determine if additional accommodations were necessary. The agency's Medical Director determined that there were no reasonable accommodations available to allow the appellant to perform the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not articulate how she would be able to perform the duties of her position that require extensive interaction with coworkers and customers based upon her request for a minimum of 24 days of absence per month to accommodate her disability. The appellant bears the burden of proving that an accommodation she seeks is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17. Based upon the evidence submitted, we find that the appellant's requested accommodation was not reasonable, and that she has not established that she could perform the duties of her position with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of its obligation to reasonably accommodate the appellant's disability, the agency must consider whether it could reassign the appellant to a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). The proposing official determined there were no available positions in the Office of the Chief Financial Officer that did not require a predictable work schedule and involve extensive interaction with customers or coworkers. The proposing official also stated that an agency human resource staff member had reviewed open positions at the agency to ascertain whether another position met her experience, education, and work restrictions, but determined that there was no such available position at the time. The appellant has not identified any open positions for which she is qualified and of which she can perform the essential functions; therefore she has not met her burden to show that vacant funded positions existed to prove her claim of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proof in a claim of disability discrimination and must show the accommodation sought is reasonable). Based upon the record evidence, we affirm the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not prove her affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its letter of decision imposing the appellant's removal, the agency explained that the appellant had been out of work for an extended period of time and had exhausted all of her leave. Additionally, the agency explained that the appellant's absence from employment had a negative impact on the agency; that, although it considered her request to telework, it was unable to grant her request because her position required frequent in-person interaction and meetings both with agency employees and with outside individuals; and that she was also required to maintain access to the Department of Defense's Secret Internet Protocol Router Network, which could not be accessed remotely from her home. Lastly, the agency noted that the appellant had been absent from work for over 6 months and that she was unable to give any indication when she would be able to return to duty. Citing these factors, the agency determined that it could not reassign her to another position and that it had no choice but to remove her from her position for inability to perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency clearly had a valid basis for removing the appellant under these facts. We agree that the appellant was unable to perform the core duties of her position and that her continued absence from work not only negatively impacted her performance, but also had an adverse effect on the agency. <span class="Italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26, 30. We thus concur with the administrative judge that the agency proved the elements of its charge, and we find it uncontroverted that there exists a nexus between the appellant's medical condition and her absence from employment. <span class="Italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 30 (medical documentation finding that the appellant is medically incapacitated and unable to work). Similarly, based on the nature of the appellant's medical conditions and diagnosis, we agree with the administrative judge that reassignment was neither reasonable nor feasible. <span class="Italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 40 (the Board will consider whether reassignment to another position is feasible when assessing the reasonableness of the penalty based on a charge of inability to perform). The administrative judge's initial decision sustaining the charge of inability to perform based on a medical condition is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge properly denied the appellant's affirmative defense.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant also challenges the administrative judge's denial of her failure to accommodate affirmative defense, arguing that under <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, he should have assessed whether her reasonable accommodation request to telework on an as-needed basis (situational) imposed an undue hardship on the agency. In making this argument, the appellant assigns error to the administrative judge's finding that she was not a qualified individual with a disability. For the reasons that follow, <span id="Page_2858"></span>we disagree with the appellant's arguments on review and find that her reliance on <span class="Italic">Alvara</span> [<span class="Italic">Alvara v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to make a reasonable accommodation to the known physical and mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can show that the accommodation would cause an undue hardship on its business operations. <span class="Italic">Miller v.

In order to establish a disability-based failure to accommodate, an employee must show that: (1) she is an individual with a disability; (2) she is a qualified individual with a disability, as defined by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); and (3) the agency failed to provide a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found it undisputed that the appellant is disabled, he concluded that the appellant failed to establish that she is a qualified individual with a disability because she is unable to perform the essential functions of her position either with or without a reasonable accommodation. On review, relying on <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>,[5] the appellant alleges that she is a qualified individual with a disability because she "was capable of performing the essential functions of her position when she was medically able to work at her usual worksite." We agree with the administrative judge that the record does not support the appellant's assertion about the extent of her capabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, the Special Panel affirmed the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) conclusion that attendance and timing are methods by which an employee performs the essential functions of her position, and are not themselves essential functions. <span class="Italic">See Alvara</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 613, &#x00B6; 37; <span class="Italic">see also Petitioner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Implicit in a claim of denial of reasonable accommodation is that the denied accommodation would have been effective and would have allowed the appellant to perform the essential functions of her position. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 21; <span class="Italic">see also White v.

The appellant's medical documentation submitted below, however, unequivocally demonstrates that the appellant was deemed completely medically incapacitated and unable "to perform work of any kind" as of February 2013, and that her treating physician reaffirmed this diagnosis on multiple occasions leading up to the appellant's removal from federal service. Based on her treating physician's conclusion that she was completely incapacitated, the appellant's request to telework on an as-needed basis could not have been an effective accommodation which would have allowed her to perform the essential functions of her position.[6] We accordingly find no reason to differ with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant is not a qualified individual with a disability, and we AFFIRM his denial of the appellant's failure-to-accommodate affirmative defense.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although the appellant argues on petition for review that she could have performed many of her job functions while teleworking, and that she could have arranged to perform certain functions when she was in the office, there is no evidence in the record that she was ever cleared to return to work on an intermittent basis. The Board has found that, if during the pendency of the Board appeal, an appellant presents new medical evidence showing that she recovered such that she can perform the essential duties of her position, the removal action will be reversed. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 144, &#x00B6; 9 (2015). The Board has held, however, that in order to invoke this principle, the appellant must present evidence which clearly and unambiguously demonstrates that she has recovered during the pendency of a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's assertions on review, without any supporting medical evidence, do not meet this standard, and we have found no evidence in the record that could support such a finding of recovery.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We further agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's request for situational telework would have been incompatible with her need to access a secured network, which could only be accessed at her worksite. <span class="Italic">Accord Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 29 (finding the appellant's request to telework incompatible with the essential functions of her position requiring travel and face-to-face interaction); <span class="Italic">Complainant v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not challenge the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's position was not subject to medical standards or physical requirements.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency further contends that the administrative judge failed to consider evidence regarding the inherent danger of working on barges and the appellant's inability to perform his duties due to the heightened risk associated with his exposure to these dangers in light of his medical condition. Contrary to the agency's assertion, the administrative judge briefly discussed in the initial decision the inherent dangers of the marine electrician position. In pertinent part, the administrative judge noted that the proposed removal did not allege that the appellant was unable to perform his duties due to the heightened risk associated with his exposure to the inherent dangers of working on barges in light of his medical condition, and he concluded that the agency could not rely on such evidence in support of its charges. ID at 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989)). The administrative judge acknowledged that there was hearing testimony regarding the inherent dangers of working on barges and the "possibility" that, due to the appellant's physical condition, he could be at a higher risk than other employees concerning such dangers. He further acknowledged the appellant's concession that the duties themselves, aside from being performed in a dangerous environment, also involved some risk. The administrative judge found, however, that the agency presented no evidence to establish that the appellant's medical condition made it highly probable that the manner in which he performed his duties would result in injury to him or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that it gave the appellant notice that it believed he could not safely perform the essential functions of his position. Even if the proposal notice sufficiently alleged that the appellant could not safely perform the essential functions of the marine electrician position due to his medical condition, we discern no error with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency did not meet its burden to show a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that the appellant's condition may result in injury to himself or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, the administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">Marques</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 132. We have considered the agency's assertion that the appellant "had a history of repeated falls due to his knee injury" and its references to the testimony that the appellant's physical presence was required on the Bank Grading Unit or other units, that the locations on which he must perform his essential duties are inherently dangerous for personnel without medical restrictions, and that employees with no medical restrictions have fallen off the unit and have been crushed, drowned, or required emergency rescues. Based on our review of the record, we agree with the administrative judge that, while possible, there is not a high probability that the appellant's medical condition may result in injury to himself or others, given the nature of the work involved. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <a href="https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/high+probability">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/high+probability</a> (defining a "high probability" as "almost certainly, favorable prospect, in all likelihood, in most instances, with a high degree of certainty"), <span class="Italic">with The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language</span>, 1370 (Houghton Mifflin Co. 4th ed. 2000) (defining "possible" <span id="Page_2859"></span>as "[c]apable of happening, existing, or being true without contradicting proven facts, laws, or circumstances").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case stands in sharp contrast to <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 9, where the Board found a high probability that Mr. Clemens' medical condition may result in injury to others. Mr. Clemens was a Supervisory Public Safety Dispatcher, and, in this capacity, he was required, among other things, to initiate "immediate, appropriate, emergency response," provide "advanced life support," such as instructing callers on how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the Heimlich maneuver, or emergency childbirth and how to open an airway or control bleeding, and give instructions "regarding what to do, and what not to do, prior to the arrival of pre-hospital care providers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. Mr. Clemens "suffered a significant loss of speech ability" after a stroke and related complications, and the agency removed him for physical inability to perform the essential functions of his position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 2. The Board found that "significant verbal communication was an essential function of the appellant's position," and it concluded there was a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that Mr. Clemens' medical condition may result in injury to others, and it sustained the inability to perform charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. Here, however, notwithstanding the inherent dangers of the appellant's work environment, we do not view his medical condition as creating a situation in which it is highly probable that he or others will be injured.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency has not persuaded us that the administrative judge erred in his conclusion that it did not prove the charge of physical inability to perform the essential functions of the marine electrician position, we affirm the initial decision in this regard. The agency has not specifically challenged the administrative judge's decision not to impose a penalty for the sustained charge of refusal to accept suitable employment, and we affirm this decision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's charge of inability to work due to depression is directly related to the appellant's perceived disability. In addition, the agency's charge of AWOL is substantially related to the appellant's disability due to depression, and does not involve any independent acts of misconduct unrelated to those issues. Because the agency explicitly based its action on the appellant's alleged disability, thus presenting direct evidence of discrimination, and did not assert any independent, nondiscriminatory reason for the action, we find that the burden-shifting analytical framework is inappropriate<span class="Italic">.

The appellant showed that she was a qualified disabled person protected by the discrimination laws because, as discussed above with respect to the charges, the evidence showed that she was capable of performing her job duties without accommodation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may remove an employee if he is unable, because of a medical condition, to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Bullock v.

To prove that an employee is unable to perform the duties of his position, the agency must establish a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance and conduct, or a reasonable probability of hazard that the employee's condition may result in injury to himself or others. <span class="Italic">See Slater v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 11 (2008). Additionally, in assessing whether an employee is unable to perform the duties of his position, the Board examines the duties of the position and compares them against the appellant's medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 537, 540 (1992). Moreover, where, as here, an agency removes an employee for medical inability to perform the essential functions of his position, the Board looks to the definition of "essential function" in 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n) to determine whether <span id="Page_2860"></span>the agency has proved the charge. Evidence of whether a function is essential may include: the employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written position descriptions and performance standards; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; and the reason the position exists. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, it is undisputed that the appellant had been absent from work for almost 9 months at the time of his removal, and the medical evidence he submitted did not provide a timeframe within which he could return to work. The appellant has not argued on review that he could perform the essential functions of his position at the time of his removal. We therefore find that the administrative judge correctly sustained the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the disability discrimination claim, the appellant argues that the agency has the burden of establishing that permitting him to use his earned sick leave would cause an undue burden because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has held that regular attendance is not an essential function of any position. He cites the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Pickens v. Social Security Administration</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 9 (2001). In <span class="Italic">Pickens</span>, the Board stated that the EEOC had "rejected the argument that regular attendance is an essential element of any position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board in <span class="Italic">Pickens</span> cited a 1998 EEOC decision, <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Runyon</span>. In that decision, the EEOC reaffirmed that "considering regular attendance an essential job function in all cases creates a circular argument that would ultimately prevent any employee with a disability who is frequently absent for disability-related reasons from being considered a qualified individual with a disability." <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Runyon</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01945685, 1998 WL 432236, at *3 (E.E.O.C. July 28, 1998). In relying on <span class="Italic">Pickens</span> and <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, the appellant seems to be ignoring the use of the term "regular attendance" in those decisions. Neither the Board nor EEOC has held that an employee who is unable to come to work at all must be considered a qualified individual with a disability. Under <span class="Italic">Pickens</span> and <span class="Italic">McNeil,</span> an agency is required to show that excusing occasional or sporadic absences that are caused by a disabling condition would be an undue hardship. However, it is axiomatic that an employee who is unable to work at all cannot perform any of the essential functions of his position, even if attendance itself is not considered an essential function. When an employee is occasionally absent, excusing those absences may be a reasonable accommodation because it permits the employee to otherwise perform the essential functions of his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(ii) (defining "reasonable accommodation" in relevant part as "[m]odifications or adjustments to the work environment...that enable a qualified individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of that position."). Conversely, when an employee is consistently absent from duty, as the appellant was in the present case, simply granting leave and excusing the absences is not an effective accommodation because it does not permit the employee to perform the essential functions of his position.[3] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to prove his claim of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For the same reason, the appointment of a temporary employee to perform the appellant's duties during his absence is not a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Combs v. SSA</span>, 91 MSPR 148, 157 &#x00B6; 21 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A charge of inability to perform job duties is distinct from a charge of unsatisfactory performance, and, unlike the latter, the former requires medical evidence showing that the employee is incapacitated for particular job duties due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v.

<p class="Body-Text">The proof required for enforced leave constituting a suspension based on medical inability to perform was outlined in <span class="Italic">Thompson v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-09-0883-I-1 (NP 4/30/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish a charge of physical inability to perform, the agency must prove a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in her performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that her condition may result in injury to herself or others. <span class="Italic">E.g., Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5 (2014); <span class="Italic">Marshall-Carter v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 10 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 122 F. App'x 513 (Fed. Cir. 2005). In other words, the agency must establish that the appellant's medical condition prevents her from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of her position. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5. In determining if the agency has met its burden, the Board will consider whether a reasonable accommodation exists that would enable the appellant to safely and efficiently perform those core duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in the relapsing, remitting form since about 2002. Since that diagnosis, she has been employed by the agency, and for about 10 months prior to her being summarily placed in off-duty status on July 2, 2009, she had been working a full-time schedule as a Supervisor, Maintenance Operation, at the Atlanta Bulk Mail Center. The appellant has maintained that at all relevant times she was physically able to perform all of the essential duties of her position. She has denied needing an accommodation for her health conditions or a light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not charge the appellant with any deficiency in performance or conduct during the time that she worked at the Atlanta Bulk Mail Center. Instead, the agency initially placed her in an off-duty status based on unspecified "verbal information" she provided on June 25, 2009, concerning her health conditions. The agency subsequently specified that she was being placed on enforced leave because of her "inability to stand and walk for prolonged periods of time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the "verbal information" provided on June 25, 2009, was given by the appellant during mediation of an equal employment opportunity complaint. That mediation resulted in a settlement agreement between the appellant and the agency. The agreement provided that, among other things, she would undergo a fitness-for-duty examination and she "agree[d] to work at the full capacity of her job description." The agency did not charge the appellant with failing to work at the full capacity of her job description before it placed her on enforced leave 12 days later, and the agency did not prove that she failed to do so. In these circumstances, we find that the agency did not prove that it had a valid basis for suspending the appellant on July 2, 2009.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may require a fitness for duty examination to assess the employee's ability to meet medical standards or physical requirements. Under <span class="Italic">Mendiola v. DHS</span>, SF-1221-13-0440-W-1 (NP 9/21/2015), involving a border patrol agent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Office of Personnel Management's regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 339, subpart C, govern an agency's authority to require a medical examination. <span class="Italic">Moe v. Department of the Navy</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 555, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). When an employee occupies a position that is subject to medical standards or physical requirements, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(3) authorizes an agency to order a medical examination whenever there is a direct question about the employee's continued capacity to meet the physical or medical requirements of the position. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(e)(1), an agency may order a psychiatric examination (including a psychological assessment) when the result of a current general examination that the agency has the authority to order under section 339.301 indicates no physical explanation for behavior or actions that may affect the safe and efficient performance of the individual or others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a BPA, the appellant was subject to physical requirements and medical standards, including psychological standards. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge should have applied the standards set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301 in evaluating the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its FFDE order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency reasonably requests the employee for available medical information concerning a medical fitness issue, <span class="Italic">McDermott v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0633-I-1 (NP 10/13/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency requested medical documentation only after the appellant reported difficulties distinguishing colors, which raised safety concerns and questions about his ability to perform job duties. The appellant has failed to show how those inquiries and discussions exceeded that which is permissible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(1) (containing an exception to the general prohibition on disclosure under the Privacy Act for disclosures to agency employees who require the records at issue to perform their duties); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A) (a disability-related inquiry is permissible under the ADA if "job-related and consistent with business necessity"); <span class="Italic">Archerda v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-30 (2014) (holding that generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be job-related and consistent with business necessity if an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a significant risk of substantial harm to self or others that cannot be eliminated by reasonable accommodation); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 825.500(g)(1) (permitting an agency to provide medical restrictions to supervisors and managers without violating the FMLA), 1630.14(c)(1)(i) (permitting an employer to provide medical restriction to supervisors and managers without violating the ADA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the significance of OWCP findings, <span class="Italic">Hodges v. DOJ</span>, 121 MSPR 337, 339 n.1, 2014 MSPB 54 (2014), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal employees who have fully or partially recovered from employment-related injuries have certain job retention rights under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, 20 C.F.R. Part 10, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> FECA insures that federal employees who are injured on the job and who have received or are receiving compensation will incur <span id="Page_2861"></span>no loss of benefits which they would have received but for the injury or disease when they return to federal employment. Because compensation benefits are payable only while an employee has a work-related, viz., "compensable," injury, OWCP's decisions reflect its determination that the appellant remained a compensably injured, partially-recovered employee until he fully recovers from his injury. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102 (defining a "partially-recovered" individual as one who suffers from residuals of a "compensable injury" and "fully recovered" as "compensation benefits have been terminated on the basis that the employee is able to perform all of the duties of the position he or she left or an equivalent one"); 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 10.5(14), (17), 10.300 (to receive wage-loss compensation based on "disability," the employee must have a work-related injury); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 10.500 (benefits under FECA are available only while the effects of a work-related condition continue). Until OWCP issues a decision to terminate the appellant's compensation benefits, the employing agency is without authority to determine on its own that his medical restrictions are no longer causally related to his employment injury, i.e., that he is no longer a "partially recovered" employee for the purposes of restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See New v.
