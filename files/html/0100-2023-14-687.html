<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-688"><span class="space">F.</span> JOINT COMMITTEES</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA generally endorses the concept of joint committees designed to identify and resolve labor-management difficulties; generally impermissible through collective bargaining are establishment of joint committees that decide substantive management rights. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1395 and SSA, Great Lakes Program Ctr.</span>, 14 FLRA 408, 414-15 (1984) (Proposal 1), although a specific proposal for a committee was disapproved for negotiation, Member Haughton, concurring, commented:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...I would not like the discussion regarding Union Proposal 1 to be regarded as prohibiting or discouraging the establishment, by voluntary agreement, of programs providing for employee involvement in joint labor-management committees. These programs provide structures whereby employees at all levels are able to participate in discussions about their work and to use their knowledge, skills, and abilities more effectively. I believe this should be encouraged as being consistent with the promotion of an effective and efficient government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Joint labor-management committees already have been successful in many areas....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree that employee involvement type programs cannot be mandated under our Statute.&#x2003;Indeed, I believe that to be successful they can be established only by voluntary agreement. It is in this area of mutually agreed upon labor-management activity that I would like to see the Federal sector as a leader, not just a follower, of private sector developments.</p>
<p class="noindent">If matters related to the exercise of a management right are within the duty to bargain, a proposal for a joint labor-management committee to decide those matters is negotiable as a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1497 and Hq., Lowry Technical Training Ctr., Lowry AFB</span>, 11 FLRA 565 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr.</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 674-75 (1992) (Proposal 5), ascertained no impediment to a union proposal setting the number of union representatives on a joint committee and vesting in the union the authority to appoint those representatives:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals which provide for joint labor-management committees whose purpose is to make recommendations concerning conditions of employment have been found to be negotiable<span class="Italic">. See, for example, National Treasury Employees Union and Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>, 31 FLRA 566, 575 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</span>), <span class="Italic">reversed in part and enforced in part as to other matters sub nom. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 152 (4th Cir. 1990) (proposal establishing advisory committee to make recommendations as to the legality of performance elements and standards found negotiable); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12, AFL-CIO and Department of Labor</span>, 17 FLRA 674, 676-77 (1985) (Department of Labor), <span class="Italic">remanded as to other matters sub nom. Local 12, American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, No. 85-1371 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 11. 1986) (proposal establishing a joint labor-management committee to discuss the use of quality circles to serve as a forum for evaluating employee concerns about the introduction of new technology found negotiable); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2761 and U.S. Department of the Army, U.S. Army Adjutant General Publication Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 14 FLRA 438 (1984) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Army Adjutant General Publication Center</span>) (proposal to create a joint labor-management committee to serve as a forum for evaluating employee training needs and for formulating programs to meet those needs without obligating the agency to bargain on the specific content of training found negotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, proposals seeking union participation on committees utilized by management as an integral part of its deliberative process under section 7106 of the Statute are nonnegotiable<span class="Italic">. See, for example, National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1437 and United States Army Armament, Research Development and Engineering Center, Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey</span>, 35 FLRA 1052 (1990) (Proposal 3) (proposal providing for union representation on agency's invention evaluation committee found nonnegotiable because it would have interjected the union into the deliberative process by which the agency exercised its right to determine the methods and means of performing its work). The Authority has consistently held that management's rights under section 7106 include more than just the right to take final actions. The rights contained in section 7106 of the Statute encompass actions integral to the exercise of those rights, including discussion of and deliberation on the factors bearing upon the final decisions. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Department of Transportation, United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 212 (1991) (<span class="Italic">United States Merchant Marine Academy</span>). Union presence, whether active or passive, at such discussions and deliberations interferes with an agency's right to engage freely in internal discussions and deliberations prior to deciding to take actions within the scope of section 7106<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the wording of the proposal and the evidence in the record, the committee would be created by the parties' agreement as a forum for the exchange of information between the Union and management concerning changes related to employees' conditions of employment, in particular, technological changes related to the use of DIS. The proposal would not enable the Union to participate in the deliberative process leading to the exercise of management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute. The authority of the proposed committee is expressly limited to making recommendations to the Director concerning DIS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The committee involved in Proposal 5 is, therefore, like the committees involved in <span class="Italic">Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Labor and U.S. Army Adjutant General Publication Center</span>, whose purposes were limited to making recommendations concerning unit employees' conditions of employment. Because Proposal 5 would not interject the Union into the deliberative process by which management determines its technology, methods, and means of performing work, we conclude that the proposal does not directly interfere with management's rights under section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that, because Proposal 5 would interject a committee into the Agency's deliberative process concerning the technology, <span id="page_1129"></span>methods, and means of performing Agency work, the portion of the first paragraph of the proposal providing for Union appointment of committee members directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's assertion that Proposal 5, insofar as it concerns the appointment of union representatives on the committee, directly interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. We have held that where participation on a committee does not involve official, prescribed duties of employees, membership on the committee does not concern the assignment of work within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 541 and Veterans Administration Hospital, Long Beach, California</span>, 12 FLRA 270, 274 (1983) (Veterans Administration Hospital). Because the committee involved in Proposal 5 is not an integral part of the Agency's decision-making process concerning the technology, methods, and means of performing its work and because participation on the committee does not involve the official prescribed duties of employees representing the Union on the committee, we conclude that sentences one, two and three of the first paragraph of the proposal do not directly interfere with the Agency's rights to direct employees and to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Accordingly, we conclude that sentences one, two and three of the first paragraph of Proposal 5 are negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees and USDA, APHIS, Hyattsville, Md.</span>, 48 FLRA 599, 605-06 (1993), declined to require negotiation of a proposal that the union designate employee representatives to a committee unilaterally established by the employer to consider matters pertaining to agency operations. A difference existed between the negotiability of proposals for staffing joint committees, established through negotiated agreements, and committees unilaterally established by the agency. Nonnegotiable was Proposal 2, requiring that the union designate all unit employees on a panel to consider the establishment of child-care centers. The committees were established through agency guidelines rather than through the collective bargaining process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to assign particular duties, including duties which are unrelated or incidental to an employee's position description.... Proposals prohibiting such assignments directly interfere with the right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the disputed portion of Proposal 2 specifically provides that the Union will designate all bargaining unit employees who will participate on child care panels. The Agency does not contest the Union's right to designate the employee who will serve as the Union representative on each panel. Instead, the Agency objects to the selection by the Union of the two employee representatives who will serve in their employee capacity. By allowing the Union to designate the two employee representatives, the proposal would require the Agency to assign panel duties and responsibilities to the employees chosen by the Union. The proposal would thereby prohibit the Agency from assigning such duties to any other bargaining unit employees. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the disputed portion of Proposal 2 directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Reclamation, Denver Office, Denver, Colorado</span>, 43 FLRA 998, 1000-02 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>) (proposal that union be allowed to appoint employees to advisory committee established by agency found to directly interfere with management's rights to assign employees and assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the proposal is negotiable because an employee's supervisor would retain the right to assess staffing, workload, and operational needs before approving official time for panel duties. The ability of the supervisor to consider such matters does not alter the fact that only the Union would be able to choose the bargaining unit employees who participate on the panel. It is management's inability to select any other bargaining unit employee for assignment to the panel that renders the proposal inconsistent with the right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's contention that the proposal does not interfere with the right to assign work because the panels considering child care needs at various worksites constitute labor-management committees. The panels here were not established through the collective bargaining process. Instead, they were established pursuant to the Agency's guidelines. As such, the panels do not constitute the type of committee, such as a labor-management committee, the establishment of which has been proposed by a union in order to express its views or to make recommendations with respect to unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 44 FLRA at 674 (distinguishing proposals providing for joint labor-management committees from proposals seeking union participation on committees utilized by management as an integral part of its deliberative process). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3732 and U.S. Dept. of Transp., United States Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 213-14 (1991) (provisions relating to establishment of <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> committee constituted negotiable procedure and did not interfere with the right to assign work). The Authority has found a proposal providing for the designation of employees to serve on a joint labor-management committee to be a negotiable procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 44 FLRA at 675-76. In contrast, because Proposal 2 would allow the Union to designate employees who would serve on panels established by the Agency to assist it in its deliberative process regarding the establishment of child care centers, we conclude that Proposal 2 interferes with the Agency's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Reclamation</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals for joint committee participation must concern committees that consider employment conditions. VA "Deans Committees" did not qualify for joint participation because they considered relations between medical centers and training conditions of affiliated medical schools. Working conditions of VA employees were not involved. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 29 FLRA 515, 545-46 (1987) (Proposal 10). To constitute interference with management rights, a proposal must involve an exercise of discretion within the authority of management. If a joint committee or board is not one specifically involved in internal agency management, the management rights problem need not arise. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maritime-Metal Trades Council and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 26 FLRA 140, 149 (1987) (Proposal 2). Union participation in the exercise of management rights, e.g., establishment of performance standards, through membership on joint labor-management committees established to take action pursuant to those rights, directly interfered with those rights in violation of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1395 and SSA, Great Lakes Program Ctr.</span>, 14 FLRA 408, 408-09 (1984) (Proposal 1). A proposal was outside the scope of bargaining that management include representation on all service committees whose work did not consist entirely of matters relating to internal management business. The proposal required union participation on committees at least partially concerned with internal management. The proposal was an impermissible intrusion into the agency deliberative process protected by &#x00A7; 7106. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 439 (1987) (Proposal 2); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 111 (2002) (reviewing arbitration award, setting aside order directing agency to appoint union-designated representative to agency's manpower committee; that committee determined to whom work would be assigned; order interfered with right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals defining duties to be assigned to joint committees and their members may be nonnegotiable. A proposal interfered with management's right to assign work that mandated that the chairmanship of a joint safety committee alternate between representatives of union and management. Proposals requiring assignment of specific duties to particular individuals, including managers, are not negotiable. Conversely, nonnegotiable are proposals precluding management from assigning specific tasks to individuals. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Dept. of Army and Air Force, Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 19 FLRA 381, 384 (1985). But negotiable as an arrangement was a proposal that a specific manager, the director of an office, respond in writing to committee recommendations within 30 days of their receipt. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr.</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 670-71 (1992) (Proposal 5).</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal called on management to advise the union of the creation of an investigatory or fact-finding committee on matters affecting unit employees and that required management to consider for membership qualified employees nominated by the union. Management was not required to make union-sponsored appointments. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 and VAMC, Salisbury</span>, 27 FLRA 52, 52-53 (1987) (Proposal 1). Nonnegotiable was a proposal that bargaining unit employees be selected by the union for membership on an advisory committee concerned with a fitness center. The proposal did not allow management to consider operational needs in assigning the employees designated by the union, <span class="Italic">IFPTE and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Denver</span>, 43 FLRA 998, 1001 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal would require that the Union be allowed to appoint employees to the Advisory Committee.&#x2003;The proposal would not allow management to consider operational needs in assigning the employees designated by the Union. Management would be required to permit the employees selected by the Union to participate on the Advisory Committee during duty time without regard to the Agency's staffing needs or the specialized skills of the employees selected by the Union. Therefore, the proposal directly interferes with management's rights to assign employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Compare New York State Nurses Association and</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Bronx Medical Center</span>, 30 FLRA 706, 741-42 (1987) (proposal providing for union appointment of a representative to data collection team interfered with management's rights to assign employees and work) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 3732 and U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, New York</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 213-14 (1991) (provisions relating to the establishment of an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> committee did not concern the assignment of work within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2)(B) because membership on the committee did not involve the official prescribed duties of unit employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1130"></span>We note that there is no contention that the proposal was intended as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal is nonnegotiable because it directly interferes with management's rights to assign employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr.</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 670, 677-80 (1992), declared negotiable as an arrangement a portion of Proposal 5 allowing the union a veto over appointments of unit employees to the management side of a joint technology committee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, sentences four and five of the first paragraph of Proposal 5 provide that the Union must approve management's choice of unit employees to serve as management representatives on the joint labor-management committee. We note at the outset that the duties of unit employees as Union representatives on that committee are not the work of the Agency.... The duties of unit employees as Union representatives involve the responsibility of unit employees to the Union and management has no role in determining which unit employees will be assigned those duties. In contrast, the additional duties associated with representing management on the joint labor-management committee do constitute the work of the Agency. Consequently, when the Agency assigns unit employees to serve as management representatives on the committee, the assignment of those additional duties constitutes an assignment of work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that these sentences are intended to prevent conflicts of interest from arising as a result of unit employees serving as management representatives on a joint labor-management committee created to enhance communication between management and the Union on technological matters that adversely affect unit employees. It is reasonably foreseeable that management's interests in these matters may differ from those of unit employees. By providing the Union the right to disapprove management's choice of unit employees to represent management on the committee, the proposal would benefit unit employees by preventing conflicts of interest that may result from such employees serving as management representatives on the committee. We find, therefore, that sentences four and five...are intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although these sentences impose a burden on management's right to require unit employees to perform this additional duty, the Union's veto power over management's choice of its representatives affects only unit employees and not other personnel. Management's ability to choose other personnel, such as management officials, supervisory employees, or other nonunit employees, to represent its interest on the committee would be unaffected by sentences four and five...Also, management could choose unit employees, so long as the Union did not disapprove such choice for conflict of interest reasons. Thus, although these sentences would impose some burden on management's exercise of its right to assign work, the sentences would offer a significant benefit to unit employees by preventing conflicts of interest that would result from such employees serving as management representatives on the committee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management could not unilaterally reduce the number of union representatives on a safety committee. The composition of that committee is a condition of employment. If the establishment of the committee is negotiable, it follows that the composition of the committee is also negotiable. The change did not constitute a work assignment. The committee was established under the negotiated agreement and had its genesis in the union-management bargaining relationship rather than a management directive. The meaning of "work" is that the work be directly and integrally related to the accomplishment of the mission of the agency. <span class="Italic">DOD, Navy Ordnance Station, Louisville and IAM Local Lodge 830</span>, 4 FLRA 760, 771 (1980) (ALJ Decision).
