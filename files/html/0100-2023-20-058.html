<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302, as amended by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act and the Follow the Rules Act of 2017:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(9)&#x2003;take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General (or any other component responsible for internal investigation or review) of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law, rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302 defines a prohibited personnel practice and an affirmative defense. As to liability for damages and other relief, under 5 USC 1221:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)(1)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure or protected activity described under section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if, after a finding that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor, the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)(1)(A)&#x2003;If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The purpose and effect of the 2012 WPEA on &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) will be elucidated through years of litigation. But the impact seems to be the creation of an IRA case for those who make the type of disclosure covered by &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) through a grievance, EEO complaint, or some other type of appeal and then suffer reprisal. Also finding potential IRA protection is the individual who testifies or aids an individual who testifies for or assists an individual involved in an appeal, complaint, or grievance; an individual who discloses information to or cooperates with the IG or OSC; or an individual on the receiving end of a personnel action for refusing to obey an illegal order. <span class="Italic">See</span> and <span class="Italic">compare</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(9), 5 USC 1214(a)(3), and 5 USC 1221(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that, insofar as the appellant alleged that she made disclosures in the context of her grievance under the governing collective bargaining agreement, such disclosures are not protected under section 2302(b)(8). We agree. Reprisal for exercising a grievance right is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Serrao v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The newly-enacted WPEA would not change our analysis of this aspect of the initial decision. Among other things, the WPEA expanded the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), to include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA extended the Board's IRA jurisdiction to claims arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), but not to those arising under (b)(9)(A)(ii). WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A). The substance of the appellant's grievance did not concern remedying an alleged violation of subparagraph (b)(8). Therefore, insofar as the appellant alleged that the agency took personnel actions in reprisal for her grievance, the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider such allegations in the context of this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More directly stated, under <span class="Italic">McCray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2023 MSPB 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13,16, 18 (2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties also do not dispute the finding that the appellant did not allege that he sought to remedy reprisal for whistleblowing in his grievances, and thus they did not constitute protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). Section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) includes as protected activity "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right...with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]." Exercising other appeal, complaint, or grievance rights falls within the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii). The Board's IRA jurisdiction includes a claim of retaliation for filing a grievance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), but not for filing a grievance under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Mudd v.

The appellant stated that this action caused the coworker to feel "isolated,...unwelcomed, not respected, unsupported and devalued as a team member." The appellant did not allege that he sought to remedy whistleblower reprisal in his May 2018 grievance.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal alleging that the agency gave him a negative appraisal, denied his within-grade increase, and subjected him to a hostile work environment in retaliation for filing a grievance that sought to remedy the agency's failure to provide him with a performance appraisal. The administrative judge found that, because the appellant's grievance was not related to an attempt to remedy a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), it was not protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). She found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he engaged in protected activity appealable to the Board in an individual right of action (IRA) appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates that he filed a grievance to remedy the agency's failure to provide him with a performance appraisal, which violated the agency's regulations.

<p class="Body-Text">Before the WPEA, the 1989 WPA expanded the protections available to those claiming reprisal for the exercise of appeal rights. The changes were described in the Board's 1989 <span class="Italic">Annual Report</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act broadened two provisions in the prohibited personnel practices statutes, thereby increasing the potential for the Special Counsel to bring corrective and disciplinary actions to the Board.... The provision prohibiting taking a personnel action based on an individual's exercise of an appeal right [5 USC 2302(b)(9)] has been...amended to include threatening to take or not take an action and to substitute the words "because of" for "as a reprisal for." In addition, the provision has been extended to also cover actions taken because of the exercise of any complaint or grievance right, testifying for or assisting any individual in the exercise of a protected right, cooperating with or disclosing information to an inspector general or the Special Counsel, and refusing to obey an order that would require the individual to violate a law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The essence of the change in the statutory language from "as a reprisal for" to "because of" was to eliminate the requirement that an appellant demonstrate a retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Traynor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 386, 393 (1994) (whistleblower need not demonstrate the existence of retaliatory motive to establish that his disclosure was a contributing factor (citing <span class="Italic">Marano v.

Following the WPEA's enactment, however, an appellant also may file an IRA appeal with the Board concerning alleged reprisal based on certain other classes of protected activity as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Differing from section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), which bars reprisal for an appellant's personal exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation concerning an alleged violation of section 2302(b)(8), section 2302(b)(9)(B) bars reprisal for assisting another individual in the exercise of <span class="Italic">any</span> appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation, and such a proceeding need not concern remedying a violation of whistleblower reprisal under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Carney</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 6 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant has alleged reprisal for activity allegedly covered by section 2302(b)(9)(B), on remand, the administrative judge must adjudicate this defense under the following framework. First, the administrative judge must determine whether the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that he was involved in protected activity under 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">See Shibuya</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 537, &#x00B6; 20. An appellant can establish that he was involved in such protected activity by proving that he testified or assisted another employee in any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Carney</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 5. Next, the administrative judge must determine whether the appellant's participation in the protected activity was a contributing factor in the challenged personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)(A)-(B); <span class="Italic">Shibuya</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 537, &#x00B6; 22. One way of proving that an appellant's prior protected activity was a contributing factor in a personnel action is the "knowledge/timing" test. <span class="Italic">See Shibuya</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 537, &#x00B6; 22. Under this test, an appellant can establish that his prior protected activity was a contributing factor in the challenged action by showing that the deciding official knew of the protected activity and took the personnel action within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the protected activity was a contributing factor in the action.[6] <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Board also has found that an appellant may establish contributing factor by providing other evidence, such as that pertaining to the strength or weakness of the agency's reasons for taking the personnel action, whether the protected activity was personally directed at the proposing or deciding officials, and whether those individuals had a motive to retaliate against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Rumsey v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 26 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant makes both of these showings by preponderant evidence, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected activity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Shannon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 24 (2014). In determining whether the agency has met this burden, the Board will consider all the relevant factors, including the following: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who did not engage in such protected activity, but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board does not view these factors as discrete elements, each of which the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence, but rather weighs these factors together to determine whether the evidence is clear and convincing as a whole. <span class="Italic">Lu v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 7 (2015). In assessing whether the agency has met its burden by clear and convincing evidence, the Board must consider all the pertinent evidence in the record, and it must not exclude or ignore countervailing evidence by only looking at the evidence that supports the agency's position. <span class="Italic">See Herman v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 15 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1367-70 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge cited the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard for retaliation claims in both the prehearing summary and initial decision.[7] However, the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard is inapplicable to claims that are subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e), such as the appellant's allegation of reprisal for participating in union activity under section 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2). Although <span class="Italic">Warren</span> has not been overruled by the Federal Circuit, the statutory changes of the WPEA significantly narrow the scope of cases to which it applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Under <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, to prevail on a claim of retaliation, an appellant must show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 656-58.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency did not challenge the administrative judge's determination that the agency's removal action was retaliation for protected activity. Nevertheless, we found that the administrative judge relied on the burden of proof set forth in <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 656-58, in both the order and summary of the close-of-record conference and the initial decision. The <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard is inapplicable to claims, like the one here, that allege reprisal for filing a prior Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e); <span class="Italic">Clay v. Department of the Army</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 10 (2016) (finding that a retaliation claim arising under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) should be analyzed under section 1221(e), rather than a general reprisal standard). Instead, the reprisal claim must be analyzed under the burden-shifting standards set forth in section 1221(e). <span class="Italic">Alarid</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 12. In such cases, the appellant first must establish by preponderant evidence that he engaged in protected activity that was a contributing factor in the personnel action at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14. If he does so, the burden of persuasion shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the appellant raised a claim that the agency's removal action was in retaliation for the filing of his prior Board appeal, which included a whistleblower retaliation claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and his filing of two separate petitions for enforcement with the Board, the proper analysis of this claim is as a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge should have apprised the parties of the burdens of proof under section 1221(e). While the case was pending on review, we issued an order to the parties setting forth the proper standards for analyzing the appellant's reprisal claim and instructing the parties to provide evidence and argument consistent with these burdens. The agency and the appellant have responded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's response challenges the administrative judge's finding that the appellant met his burden to prove that he engaged in protected activity that was a contributing factor in his removal. The administrative judge found in pertinent part that the deciding official was aware of the appellant's 2013 and 2014 protected activity when he made his removal decision in 2014. We see no reason to disturb these factual findings on review, given the similarity in the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard cited by the administrative judge and the appellant's initial burden under section 1221(e). <span class="Italic">Compare Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 656-58 (setting forth the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard), <span class="Italic">with Mastrullo v. Department of Labor</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 21 (2015) (explaining that the knowledge/timing test allows an employee to demonstrate that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and that the personnel action occurred within 1 to 2 years of the appellant's disclosures); <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980) (finding that the Board generally will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence). Therefore, we decline to consider the agency's new arguments and evidence to the extent that they concern the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal for protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, because the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard lacks a similar element, we have considered the agency's response to the extent that it addresses its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's protected activity, i.e., the appellant's prior Board appeal alleging whistleblowing retaliation and the subsequent compliance matters. Clear and convincing evidence "is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.4(e). It is a higher standard than preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. International Boundary and Water Commission</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 43 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 4 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In determining whether the agency has shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of protected activity, the Board generally will consider the following factors: (1) the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its action; (2) the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency's officials who were involved in the decision; and (3) any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who did not engage in protected activity but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Alarid</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 14. The Board must consider all pertinent record evidence in making this determination. <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d <span id="Page_3738"></span>1353, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Mattil v. Department of State</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 25 (2012). The Board does not view these factors as discrete elements, each of which the agency must prove by clear and convincing evidence. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Transportation</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). Rather, the Board will weigh the factors together to determine if the evidence is clear and convincing as a whole. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its removal action is weak and, as noted above, was in large part prepared well after the fact. As we found above, after considering all of the evidence, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency did not prove either of the charges against the appellant. Furthermore, the agency's delay in taking any sworn witness statements concerning the appellant's alleged actions until more than 5 months after the proposal notice had been issued--in addition to raising serious due process concerns--strongly suggests that: (1) it did not consider the appellant to have engaged in serious misconduct; and (2) the charges were a pretext for reprisal.</p>

In interpreting the pre-WPEA version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), the Board specifically held that a claim of reprisal for exercising a right to complain in certain administrative proceedings, such as Board appellate proceedings, the equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint process, grievance proceedings, and unfair labor practice proceedings, was not a basis for a finding of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Coffer v.

Department of the Treasury</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 224 (1998), the appellant, an Alternate Board Member of the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board (ECAB), alleged that the agency retaliated against her for submitting a CA-1 Notice of Traumatic Injury to the ECAB's Chairman. The Board found that an employee who files a Form CA-1 is exercising his or her right to file a "claim" for "payment of compensation" under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 508; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8121, 8124. The Board determined that, in adjudicating a FECA claim, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) decides whether the claimant has provided sufficient evidence of a nexus between the injury and her course of employment and, if so, the amount and kind of compensation to be awarded. <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 508; <span class="Italic">see Anderson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Comparing the nature and scope of a FECA claim with, for example, an appeal to the Board, a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an unfair labor practice complaint, or a grievance, the Board in <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span> concluded that the submission of a FECA claim for compensation for a work-related injury does not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against an employer for the perceived violation of an employee's rights. <span class="Italic">VonKelsch</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 508; <span class="Italic">see Williams</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 553. Accordingly, the Board found that the filing of a CA-1 is not the "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right" within the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 508-09.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA amended various provisions of the WPA, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). The new statutory language provides that it is a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant because of "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--(i) with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]; or (ii) other than with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A). Nothing in the WPEA, however, alters the Board's previous analysis concerning the meaning of the terms "appeal, complaint, or grievance" in the statutory language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that filing a motion to dismiss an indictment does not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against an employer for a perceived violation of employment rights. <span class="Italic">See Ledeaux v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 440, 444 (1985) (holding that an <span id="Page_3739"></span>appellant's filing of a criminal complaint for assault and battery against his supervisor was not the sort of activity covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)). The opposing party in the criminal proceeding is the federal government, acting not as an employer, but as a prosecutor. The district court is not empowered to grant relief for any personnel action related to the indictment. Thus, we conclude that the appellant's disclosure to the court was made outside of procedures that fall within the protection of section 2302(b)(9), and therefore the disclosure can serve as a basis for Board jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal under section 2302(b)(8). The administrative judge's finding to the contrary was erroneous.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The WPEA provides for Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal where the appellant engaged in activities covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). The administrative judge found that the appellant's motion to dismiss his criminal indictment was not an activity falling within the purview of section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) because the motion did not seek to remedy or correct an action that was taken in retaliation for whistleblowing. ID at 6 (citing <span class="Italic">Mudd v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2013)). We need not address the administrative judge's reasoning because the appellant presented sufficient evidence to establish that his disclosure was protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). We also note that the WPEA provides for Board jurisdiction over claims of reprisal for testifying or lawfully assisting any individual exercising an appeal, grievance, or complaint right, reprisal for cooperating with or disclosing information to an Inspector General or OSC, or reprisal for refusing to obey an order that would require a violation of law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), (C), and (D); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). There is no contention that these sorts of activities are present in this appeal and thus those provisions have no application to the instant case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA expanded the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) to afford the Board jurisdiction in IRA appeals over allegations of reprisal for "testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any" "appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)-(B). On review, the appellant argues that his disclosures and protests about racial discrimination constituted "lawful assistance" because "it is a regulatory requirement that employees disclose abuse to appropriate authorities," and "discrimination, whether against oneself or others in the workplace, is a form of abuse which, when reported, deserves all available protection against reprisal." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(11) (stating that Federal employees "shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities"). The appellant also argues that the right to oppose discriminatory practices "is a fundamental component of the civil rights laws, and lawful assistance is embodied in the opposition clause" of the civil rights statutes. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a). Finally, he argues that the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees the right to petition the Government for redress of grievances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by these arguments. The statute provides that the Board has jurisdiction under section 2302(b)(9)(B) only when the individual for whom the appellant is testifying or is otherwise lawfully assisting in exercising "any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." Accordingly, the Board has held that neither testifying on behalf of a coworker as part of an administrative investigation, nor filing a motion to dismiss a criminal indictment, were protected under section 2302(b)(9)(B) because these activities were not the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right by another employee, as they did not constitute initial steps toward taking legal action against the agency for perceived violations of employment rights.[9] <span class="Italic">Graves v.

Under the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, it is a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant because of "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation: (i) with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]; or (ii) other than with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A).

Similarly, the administrative judge considered the appellant's claim that she attempted to request mediation for alleged violations of Executive Order 13548, but found no showing that any such request was made pursuant to a grievance procedure established by law, rule, or regulation. Again, the appellant did not nonfrivolously allege that her request for mediation constituted an initial step toward taking legal action against the agency for a perceived violation of her rights, and therefore she has not established the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A). <span class="Italic">Graves</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 18.

Also, under the WPEA, the Board has jurisdiction over claims of retaliation for lawfully assisting a coworker in a grievance proceeding granted by law, rule, or regulation, even outside of the context of union-related duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 17.33(g) provides for patient grievances. Specifically, it provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[e]ach patient has the right to present grievances with respect to perceived infringement of the rights described in this section or concerning any other matter on behalf of himself, herself or others, to staff members at the facility in which the patient is receiving care, other Department of Veterans Affairs officials, government officials, members of Congress or any other person without fear or reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 17.33(g). The appellant gave the envelopes to the veterans experiencing long wait times in the BTO so that they could express their frustration to the head of the agency, consistent with the grievance rights provided in section 17.33(g). Therefore, we find that he made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was assisting patients with a grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 MSPR 595, 611-12 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992), provided the Board its first opportunity to address the portion of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) making it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action against an employee because of his cooperation with or disclosures to OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel set forth an alternative theory of liability in counts five through eight. These counts cite the actions and threatened actions set forth in the first four counts as establishing liability under 5 USCA 2302(b)(9)(C). The CALJ, while noting that it was not strictly necessary to consider the alternative theory in view of his findings on the first four counts, stated his opinion that section 2302(b)(9)(C) does not cover the type of conduct at issue here. In the CALJ's view (b)(9)(C) only applies where an employee discloses information while cooperating with the IG during an investigation. We find the CALJ's reading of the statute too narrow.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for statutory interpretation must be the language itself.... Section (b)(9)(C) refers to cooperation with, "or" disclosure of information to, the Inspector General of an agency or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law. According to the general rule of statutory construction "or" should be given disjunctive rather than conjunctive effect.... Thus, on its face, section 2302(b)(9)(C) covers disclosures made while cooperating with the Inspector General or Special Counsel during an investigation and those made independent of an investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, a statute should not be interpreted in such a way as to render one part superfluous.... If we were to interpret section 2302(b)(9)(C) literally as covering all disclosures to an Inspector General or the Special Counsel, it would render section 2302(b)(8), at least to the extent that the disclosures meet the statutory requirements of that section, superfluous. Thus, we conclude that Congress did not intend such an interpretation.... Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the Special Counsel, that section 2302(b)(9)(C) covers those employee disclosures to an Inspector General or the Special Counsel which do not meet the precise terms of the actions described in section 2302(b)(8).[20] ... Furthermore, because neither respondent nor the Special Counsel argues that any of the alleged disclosures were not of the type covered by section 2302(b)(8), the Board finds that the disclosures fall within the scope of this section. Thus, under the analysis set forth above, the disclosures are not also covered by section 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;For example, a disclosure of mismanagement or a waste of funds which does not rise to the level of "gross mismanagement" or "gross waste of funds" required by section 2302(b)(8) would be protected under section 2302(b)(9). Additionally, section 2302(b)(9), unlike section 2302(b)(8), does not impose a reasonability standard. Section 2302(b)(9) requires only that the employee's or applicant's disclosures to the Special Counsel or Inspector General of an agency be made in accordance with applicable provisions of law in order to be protected.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3741"></span>Following enactment of the WPA, reprisal against individuals complaining to the IG was covered in an IRA case. The 2012 WPEA added to preexisting Board IRA jurisdiction. Under 5 USC 2302(b)(9), it is a prohibited personnel practice to:</p>

DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 39 (2022)), determined that an IRA appeal may be based on the initiation of an IG complaint, or management's perception that the appellant made a complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case differs from the typical IRA appeal in that the appellant alleges that the agency took personnel actions against him in part because of his protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), but also in part because of its mistaken belief that he engaged in activity protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) by reporting matters to his agency's OIG. Under the latter provision, it is a prohibited personnel practice for an agency to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of...cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). We have not yet had the opportunity to address whether an appellant may seek corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) based on a claim of reprisal for perceived 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) activity. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the Board is authorized to consider such a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the statute speaks to the motivation of the agency, forbidding the agency to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of "cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). It does not specify that the appellant actually must have engaged in the protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) that motivated the agency. As to the Board's jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) provides that, if the jurisdictional requirements are otherwise met, an employee may seek corrective action before the Board with respect to any personnel action taken against that individual "as a result of <span class="Italic">a</span> prohibited personnel practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) (emphasis added). Thus, the statute does not require specifically that the prohibited personnel practice for which the appellant seeks corrective action involve a protected disclosure or protected activity on the part of the appellant. We find nothing in the legislative history of the WPA, which introduced 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), or the WPEA, which extended the protections of the WPA to activity described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), to suggest that Congress intended a narrower reading.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155 at 1, which states that the WPEA "will strengthen the rights and protections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more effectively help root out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, a broad reading of the statute would harmonize with our existing case law holding that the protections of the WPA may be available to employees who did not make protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303(b)(8), but were perceived as having done so. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2011). For example, we have found that the WPA may cover a "mistaken identity" scenario, in which the relevant agency official believed the appellant made disclosures that were in fact made by another individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 274, 276, 278-80 (1990). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, failure to provide an employee with the protections of the WPA in such circumstances would discourage other employees from make protected disclosures, and such a chilling effect would contravene the purpose of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 278-79. Similarly, we find that to exclude from the Board's jurisdiction claims of reprisal based on perceived 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) activity would defeat the purpose of the statute by discouraging other employees from engaging in activity which Congress has found to be in the public interest. Although the protection in section 2309(b)(9) is for the activity of going to the OIG, it is actually the equivalent of protecting disclosures to the OIG. Given that the Board has long decided to protect disclosures it would be inconsistent not to protect this disclosure/activity as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) authorizes the Board to consider a request for corrective action where the appellant alleges that the agency violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) by taking or failing to take a personnel action based on its perception that he engaged in activity protected under that statute. As with a claim of reprisal for perceived whistleblowing, the Board will not inquire regarding whether the appellant actually engaged in the protected activity; rather, the issue of whether the agency perceived the appellant to have engaged in the protected activity will stand in for that portion of the analysis at both the jurisdictional and merits stage of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8 (describing the analysis to be applied in a claim of retaliation for perceived whistleblowing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Batra v. VA</span>, SF-1221-15-0674-W-1 (NP 1/11/2023), offered analysis of standards governing IRA cases founded on reprisal for IG complaints:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not raised by the appellant on review, we modify the initial decision to clarify the proper analytical standard by which to evaluate the appellant's communications with OIG. The administrative judge acknowledged that the appellant's communications to OIG are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), which makes it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action against an employee because of "disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency." However, in the initial decision, she also referenced the standard for general retaliation claims. ID at 7-8, 10-11 (citing <span class="Italic">Murry v. General Services Administration</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 560, &#x00B6; 6 (2003), for the proposition that the appellant must show that he engaged in protected activity, the accused official knew of the protected activity, the adverse employment action could have been retaliation under the circumstances, and there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse employment action). In Alarid v. Department of the Army, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 15 (2015), the Board clarified that the standard for general retaliation claims is inapplicable to claims that are subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e). As noted above, the appellant's communications to OIG are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), and they are subject to the burden-shifting framework set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1)-(2). We therefore modify the administrative judge's analysis, and we find that the appellant's communications with OIG in 2011 and 2014 constitute protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(C).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least through the enactment of the WPEA, the essence of <span class="Italic">Hathaway</span> is that a claim of reprisal for having complained to the IG may be pursued before the Board in an IRA appeal under the WPA if the complaint to the IG constitutes a disclosure under 5 USC 2302(b)(8). If the complaint to the IG is not a disclosure protected under 2302(b)(8), however, retaliation for the complaint is prohibited under 2302(b)(9). Violations of the latter section are not an independent source of Board jurisdiction prior to the WPEA. <span class="Italic">Booker v.
