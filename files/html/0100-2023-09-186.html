<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-183"><span class="space">4.</span> "John Doe" Appeal: Protecting Appellant's Privacy</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Board records (some of them) are available for public inspection. [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-028.html#sec1-29">MSPB Records</a>."] The Board considers initial decisions and final decisions to be public records. Particularly inquisitive prospective employers or others could check with regional Board offices to determine whether a job-seeker has litigation pending before the Board. The Board's website carries final decisions, both precedential and nonprecedential, easily searched by name. Commercial databases carry Board final decisions and they harvest initial decisions of AJs. Someone searching a particular name on a commercial database carrying initial decisions may be able to locate an initial decision that does no more than dismiss an appeal without prejudice to refile the appeal or that dismisses an appeal as settled. A Board initial or final decision will show the appellant's name, and the docket number will reveal the type of case, e.g., an adverse action (removal, long suspension, or demotion) through the designation of the case as a "752" appeal, or as a performance case, through the designation the case as a "432" appeal. A knowledgeable researcher will then know that the appellant was likely the object of an adverse action by an agency, and that information could lead to further inquiry concerning that person who shows up as an applicant for a job with the researcher's agency. An appellant may seek to avoid that type of scrutiny. Or, It may be that an appellant is charged with some notorious or disgraceful act and desires that the proceeding be handled without publicity. Or, it may be that a witness or family member of the appellant is named in a case and the associated facts may be stigmatizing or embarrassing for that person.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How does one protect one's anonymity before the Board, operating as a public agency but with some regard to the integrity of its records under the Privacy Act? It is difficult or impossible as the system is currently structured, except in the exceptional cases--and then ordinarily to protect the privacy not of the appellant, but of some other person or persons, or, for the appellant, under the <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> case, <span class="Italic">post,</span> "a litigant seeking anonymity before the Board must present evidence establishing that harm is likely, not merely possible, if his or her name is disclosed." With but limited protections available, Board decisions are public records and accessible under the Freedom of Information Act, subject to redaction for national security interests and privacy interests discussed below. The Board docket numbering system indirectly but reasonably clearly references the nature of the appeal. The EEOC may have had anonymity of litigants in mind when, in 2013, it started titling all of its appellate decisions (accessible through commercial databases) so that the complainant was given the name of, yes, "complainant," and in 2015, when it decided to assign <span id="Page_1164"></span>randomly-generated fictitious names to complainants. OWCP titles case as "complainant," with a docket number. Security clearance adjudications through DOD use a numbering system to identify cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It must also be recognized that the Board's hearing are open to the public. The Board may, however, close the hearing to the public for good cause shown. As to privacy during the hearing process, a request for a closed hearing should be filed. [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-084.html#sec3-84">Public Hearing; Closing the Hearing</a>."] As to records developed during the course of an appeal (the appeal, and attachments; the response to the appeal, and attachments; the prehearing submissions, hearing exhibits, and briefs), a motion may be filed requesting that the appellant's privacy be protected by having the record sealed so that it cannot be readily disclosed to the public. [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-031.html#sec1-32">Sealing of Record or Files</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If anonymity of the appellant is a concern, as to the existence of the appeal itself and the decisions resulting from the appeal, when the appeal is filed, along with or without a motion to seal the record, a motion may be filed to have the appeal captioned under a fictitious name or under the appellant's initials. The Board permits "John Doe" captioning to protect against a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of third parties. <span class="Italic">Doe v. NSA</span>, 6 MSPR 555, 555 n.*, 6 MSPB 467 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 128, 129 n.1, 7 MSPB 612 (1981). From the discussion that follows, it will be seen that the Board discourages John Doe captioning. But at least at the initial stage in the regional office where the case is filed, the decision is that of the AJ. Experience shows that AJs may not care one way or another about the style of the caption and readily agree to the use of a John Doe style. The best use of a John Doe caption is at the onset of the case. If in the early stages of a case a dismissed without prejudice, the DWOP will be by initial decision, and that initial decision may show up on a commercial database. If the style is later changed to John Doe, and if that initial decision is in the database, the operators of the database are not going to change the name of the appellant on that initial decision to John Doe if it was originally captioned with the appellant's name. [Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-030.html#sec1-31">Precluding Access</a>," contains discussion of the Board's internal guidance concerning redaction, sanitization, and sealing of Board records.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> explains internal guidance concerning "John Doe" appeals at Chapter 2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PSEUDONYMOUS APPEALS (JOHN DOE APPEALS--WHEN THE APPELLANT SEEKS ANONYMITY)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span>. An AJ may be requested to allow an appellant to proceed anonymously in his or her appeal before the Board. In addition, an AJ may, on his or her own motion, require the appellant's anonymity in the interest of a third party's privacy. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 17, section 3. The AJ should also be aware that there may be instances when an appellant establishes a need to proceed anonymously for national security reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Procedure</span>. An appellant's request to proceed anonymously should be treated as a motion. If the request is not in the proper form of a motion, the appellant should be given the opportunity to perfect it. Furthermore, if the case record does not already contain a separate statement or appeal with identifying information, including the appellant's name and address, phone number, etc., the AJ must require the appellant to submit such identifying information to establish the appeal's <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> or collateral estoppel (law of the case doctrine) effect, as well as for other tracking and historical purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roe v. Ingram</span>, 364 F. Supp. 536, 541 n.7 (S.D.N.Y. 1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because of the need for a ruling on the motion very early in the Board's proceedings, an expedited procedure such as this should be invoked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When an Appellant Should Be Allowed to Proceed Anonymously.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Threat of Actual Physical Harm</span>. An appellant should be allowed to proceed anonymously when a threat of actual physical harm is present. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Doe v. United States Postal Service</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 128 (1981) (a threat to the appellant's physical safety because he was in hiding from organized crime).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters of a Sensitive or Highly Personal Nature</span>. Fear of financial or professional injury does not justify allowing an appellant to proceed anonymously. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Southern Methodist University Association v. Wynne &#x0026; Jaffe</span>, 599 F.2d 707 (5th Cir. 1979). However, the Board has allowed anonymity to prevent an unwarranted invasion of a third party's personal privacy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Doe v. National Security Agency</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 555 (1981) (removal based on charges of sexual acts performed with a minor daughter), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Stalans v. National Security Agency,</span> 678 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria to Be Used by the AJ</span>. As stated in <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">The Board has not adopted a rigid, mechanical test for determining whether to grant anonymity, but instead applies certain general principles in making such determinations. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Department of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). Those factors include whether identification creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm, whether anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in a matter of a sensitive and highly personal nature, or whether the anonymous party is compelled to admit his intention to engage in illegal acts, thereby risking criminal prosecution. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Does I Thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp</span>., 214 F.3d 1058, 1068 (9th Cir. 2000)). The Board also considers whether anonymity is necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a third party or whether anonymity is necessary to preserve the appellant's physical safety. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Other potentially relevant factors include whether the appellant requested anonymity when the proceedings began before the Board or immediately after the need for anonymity became apparent, and which party placed the sensitive matter in question at issue in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">A party seeking anonymity must overcome the presumption that parties' identities are public information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. Anonymity should be granted to litigants before the Board only in unusual circumstances, and the determination whether to grant anonymity must depend on the particular facts of each case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An appellant seeking anonymity before the Board must present evidence establishing that harm is likely, not merely possible, if his name is disclosed. Even when some harm is likely, the Board grants anonymity only when the likelihood and extent of harm to the appellant significantly outweighs the public interest in the disclosure of the parties' identities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Board no longer grants "Jane Doe" status. Rather, cases in which a request for anonymity is granted, regardless of the appellant's gender, are titled "John Doe." While the above remains true, it appears that the Board has been more liberal in granting Doe status in recent years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sealing the Record, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and Privacy Act.</span> The Board has denied an appellant's request to seal all or part of the record, even when it has granted a request for John Doe status based on the medical evidence in the record of the appeal. In so doing, it stated that the case files from appeals are not available to the public by e-Appeal Online or the Board's website, and that medical records are exempt from disclosure under FOIA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6). <span class="Italic">Doe v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R.579, n.5 (2012). Also, pursuant to the Privacy Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, the appellant's medical records cannot be disclosed by the Board without the appellant's express written consent. Thus, the Board held that granting the appellant's request to seal her records would not provide her with any additional privacy protection. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Other types of information, however, may well be subject to FOIA, and sealing will not assure that the information is not made available to others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonparty Anonymity</span>. Increasingly, the Board affords anonymity to nonparties to appeals, including witnesses, agency officials, and others who were involved in the development of the case or the facts that led the agency to take action. Such persons are often referred to by their initials, their job titles, or as Witness 1, 2, etc., or by some other designation that does not make their name apparent to a reader unfamiliar with the facts of the case. In many such cases the person has not requested that the AJ or the Board allow anonymity. While the Board does not have case law or a specific policy on this matter, AJs may, at the request of a person involved in a case that is before them, or on their own motion if they believe it appropriate, keep confidential the identity of such individuals by referring to them in such a way in the initial decision. The names of comparators in discrimination and penalty analyses are generally appropriate for anonymity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">John Doe appellations are few in comparison to decisions carrying the appellant's full name.<span class="Italic"> Ortiz v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ORTIZ_ISAIAS_CH_0752_02_0318_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247235.pdf">103 MSPR 621</a>, 624-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-14, 2006 MSPB 305 (2006), established a presumption against the use of fictitious names for parties except in compelling circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant has requested that our ruling in this matter be prepared in a manner that avoids disclosure of his name, "other pertinent identifying information," or medical information. The appellant claims that such information might be used to deny him employment opportunities if it is available to the public. The appellant indicates that the agency does not oppose his request for confidentiality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There appear to be three possible ways that we could issue a decision in this case while honoring the appellant's request for confidentiality. First, we could allow the appellant to proceed anonymously. Alternatively, we could refrain from discussing any details of the appellant's medical <span id="Page_1165"></span>condition in our decision. Finally, we could issue an unpublished decision. For the reasons set forth below, we reject each of these options.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the United States Supreme Court has never expressly considered the propriety of permitting litigants to proceed anonymously, the Court has implicitly endorsed the practice by addressing, without comment, the substantive claims of litigants proceeding under fictitious names. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roe v. Wade</span>, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Several courts of appeals have explicitly considered the issue, and all have concluded that, in limited circumstances, anonymous litigation is permissible. <span class="Italic">James v. Jacobson</span>, 6 F.3d 233 (4th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Stegall</span>, 653 F.2d 180 (5th Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Doe v. City of Chicago</span>, 360 F.3d 667 (7th Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Does I Thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp.</span>, 214 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">M.M. v. Zavaras</span>, 139 F.3d 798 (10th Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Frank</span>, 951 F.2d 320 (11th Cir. 1992). The courts have granted anonymity "(1) when identification creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm, (2) when anonymity is necessary 'to preserve privacy in a matter of sensitive and highly personal nature,' and (3) when the anonymous party is 'compelled to admit [his or her] intention to engage in illegal conduct, thereby risking criminal prosecution.'" <span class="Italic">Advanced Textile Corp.</span>, 214 F.3d at 1068 (internal citations omitted). Even when one of those three circumstances is present, the need for anonymity must be balanced against the presumption that parties' identities are public information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has, in a few rare instances, allowed appellants to proceed anonymously. In a case involving a federal employee accused of performing sexual acts with his minor daughter, we deleted the appellant's name to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a third party. <span class="Italic">Doe v. National Security Agency</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 555, 555 (1981). In the case of a federal employee who feared for his life after cooperating with an organized crime investigation, we did not use the appellant's real name because of concern for his physical safety, <span class="Italic">Doe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 128, 129, n.1 (1981). In another case in which we granted anonymity to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Doe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 493 (2004), we did not explain the reason for deleting the appellant's real name.[1] In none of our prior decisions have we set forth a standard for determining whether to grant an appellant's request for anonymity.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that the appellant in that case suffered from HIV/AIDS, a fact that presumably motivated his desire for anonymity. 95 M.S.P.R. at 495.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Our <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> does provide guidance to administrative judges on how to handle requests for anonymity. <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board Judges' Handbook</span>, Ch. 2, &#x00A7; 5. Our decision in this case is consistent with the standards set forth in the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we decline to create a rigid, mechanical test for determining whether to grant anonymity, there are some general principles that should apply to such determinations. We agree with the courts of appeals that a party seeking anonymity must overcome the presumption that parties' identities are public information. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Frank</span>, 951 F.2d at 323. Anonymity should be granted to litigants before the Board only in unusual circumstances, and the determination whether to grant anonymity must depend on the particular facts of each case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A litigant seeking anonymity before the Board must present evidence establishing that harm is likely, not merely possible, if his or her name is disclosed. Even where some harm is likely, we will grant anonymity only where the likelihood and extent of harm to the appellant significantly outweighs the public interest in disclosure of parties' identities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argues that his identity should be hidden because the facts concerning his medical condition "might be misinterpreted and/or otherwise used to deny him employment opportunities." The appellant's speculative claim about the harm he might suffer if some third party misinterprets the factual information contained in our decision is simply not enough to justify shielding his identity. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Indiana Black Expo, Inc.</span>, 923 F. Supp. 137, 140-43 (S.D. Ind. 1996) (denying the anonymity request of a plaintiff who asserted that the disclosure of his medical history, including mental health hospitalization, could adversely affect "his current employment and other business interests").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the speculative nature of the appellant's claim, other factors support our conclusion that granting anonymity is not appropriate in this case. We note that the appellant filed his PFR, along with supporting medical documentation, using his real name and without requesting anonymity. His request for anonymity came almost 2 months later. While this fact alone is not dispositive, we are more likely to grant a request for anonymity that is made at the time of filing the appeal, or immediately after the need for anonymity becomes apparent. Also, we note that the appellant himself raised the issue of his medical condition as justification for the delay in filing his PFR. We would be more likely to grant an appellant's request for anonymity where the agency, rather than the appellant himself, has placed sensitive information about the appellant at issue. Moreover, this case does not involve the privacy interests of a third party. Finally, we have no reason to believe that disclosing the details of the appellant's medical conditions would cause extreme embarrassment or expose him to public ridicule. Upon consideration of all of these factors, we conclude that the appellant should not be permitted to proceed anonymously. His interest in maintaining his privacy does not outweigh the public interest in disclosure of the parties' identities. While the Board has the discretion to omit "identifying details" from a decision "to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a)(2)(E), we do not find that high standard met in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an alternative to allowing the appellant to proceed anonymously, we could honor his request for confidentiality by refraining from discussing the details of his medical condition in our decision. We decline to do so, however, because our decision on the timeliness of the appellant's PFR requires discussion of his medical conditions and supporting medical evidence. Fairness to the parties requires that we explain why we have reached a particular conclusion. Moreover, we must articulate the evidence and reasoning in support of our decision in order to permit effective judicial review. <span class="Italic">See Letenyei v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 528, 533 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (vacating the Board's decision and directing the Board to "adequately explain the reasons for its decision"). Although we will refrain from disclosing sensitive or potentially embarrassing information that is not relevant to our resolution of this case, we cannot refrain from discussing those facts that are essential to our decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final option available to us in order to comply with the appellant's request for confidentiality is to issue an opinion that includes the appellant's real name and the details of his medical condition, but is unavailable to the public. We have no established procedure for issuing unpublished opinions and believe that such a procedure would be inappropriate. The Board is a public body and the public has a right to be informed of the Board's decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a)(2)(A) (requiring that agencies make available, for public inspection and copying, their final opinions and orders made in the adjudication of cases). Moreover, our published opinions provide guidance to appellants, their representatives, and federal agencies as to how we might rule in similar cases in the future.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 685-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-19, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007), reaffirmed the Board's disinclination to permit anonymous appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not adopted a rigid, mechanical test for determining whether to grant anonymity, but instead applies certain general principles in making such determinations. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Department of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). Those factors include whether identification creates a risk of retaliatory physical or mental harm, whether anonymity is necessary to preserve privacy in a matter of a sensitive and highly personal nature, or whether the anonymous party is compelled to admit his intention to engage in illegal acts, thereby risking criminal prosecution. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8 (citing <span class="Italic">Does I Thru XXIII v. Advanced Textile Corp.</span>, 214 F.3d 1058, 1068 (9th Cir. 2000)). The Board also considers whether anonymity is necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of a third party or whether anonymity is necessary to preserve the appellant's physical safety. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 9. Other potentially relevant factors include whether the appellant requested anonymity at the commencement of the proceeding before the Board or immediately after the need for anonymity became apparent, and which party placed the sensitive matter in question at issue in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party seeking anonymity must overcome the presumption that parties' identities are public information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10. Anonymity should be granted to litigants before the Board only in unusual circumstances, and the determination whether to grant anonymity must depend on the particular facts of each case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> A litigant seeking anonymity before the Board must present evidence establishing that harm is likely, not merely possible, if his name is disclosed. Even where some harm is likely, the Board grants anonymity only where the likelihood and extent of harm to the appellant significantly outweighs the public interest in the disclosure of the parties' identities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant raises five reasons why he should be granted anonymity. First, he correctly notes that he requested anonymity in his initial pleading before the Board. This weighs in favor of granting his request. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the appellant argues that the parties agreed to confidentiality before the arbitrator in order to prevent the disclosure of information that might be protected by the attorney-client privilege and to protect against the disclosure of sensitive medical information about the appellant and others. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, the "Confidentiality Advisory" issued by the agency before the arbitrator applies only to information relevant to the agency's mission of enforcing the federal election laws, i.e., pending matters before the agency and the private nature of the agency's investigations. It does not protect against the disclosure of internal personnel matters, sensitive medical information, or material protected by the attorney-client privilege.<span class="Italic"></span> Moreover, the "Confidentiality Advisory" does not protect against the disclosure of the parties' identities. We find, therefore, that the "Confidentiality Advisory" does not provide any basis for granting the appellant's request for anonymity before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1166"></span>Third, the appellant argues that he is entitled to anonymity because the agency put his medical condition at issue by discussing it in the notice of proposed removal. The record reveals that it was the appellant who put his medical condition at issue when he raised it to the agency after he was put on administrative leave following the September 7, 2004 incident,[1] and the appellant continues to rely on his medical condition as a basis for mitigating the removal penalty and as the basis for his affirmative defense of disability discrimination. This factor does not weigh in favor of granting anonymity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Following his placement on administrative leave, the appellant sent a letter to the agency's Staff Director in which he offered to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination, medical testing, or professional counseling, but he did not claim to have any medical condition. Shortly thereafter, the appellant's physician sent the agency a brief letter in which he stated that the appellant was in treatment for "Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent, severe," and had been experiencing symptoms of depression, irritability, sleep problems, and poor concentration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, the appellant asserts that his anonymity is necessary in order to protect the privacy of third parties (two named individuals, "X" and "Y," and an unknown number of unnamed others) whose medical conditions might be disclosed. After considering the appellant's arguments, we are not persuaded either that "harm is likely" to "X" and/or "Y" should the appellant's identity be revealed, or that his anonymity is the only way to safeguard the privacy of "X" and "Y." <span class="Italic">See Ortiz</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fifth, the appellant contends that anonymity is necessary in order to preserve the integrity of certain ongoing investigations. However, the appellant has not shown how these other investigations are even remotely relevant to the case at bar or how the disclosure of his identity in this case could have any bearing whatsoever on those investigations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We require parties requesting anonymity to make an actual evidentiary showing that "harm is likely, not merely possible, if his or her name is disclosed." <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 10. The appellant has offered nothing more than a bare allegation that "harm is likely"; he has not explained why "harm is likely," and he has not offered any evidence to support his allegation. Thus, he has not rebutted the presumption that parties' identities are public information in Board cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that this case bears many similarities to our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>. In both cases, the appellants seek anonymity primarily in order to protect against the disclosure of their medical conditions when a discussion of their medical conditions and the evidence pertaining thereto is necessary to the resolution of their cases. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 13. This is no different from the many Board cases in which an employee's medical condition is at issue. Medical conditions arise, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, in claims for disability retirement, in disability discrimination claims, as a justification for untimely filings or charges of misconduct, and as a reason to mitigate a penalty. While the appellant understandably wishes to preserve his privacy, we have no reason to believe his situation is extraordinary when viewed against the many published Board decisions in which a medical condition is discussed. We see nothing about the appellant's particular condition that "would cause extreme embarrassment or expose him to pubic ridicule." <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 12. For all of the above reasons, the appellant's request for anonymity is denied.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We deny the appellant's request to seal portions of the record for the same reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied a Doe appellation when the appellant failed to identity specific harm were her name disclosed in an appeal involving a medical disability, <span class="Italic">Tatsis v. DHUD</span>, CB-7121-16-0003-V-1 (NP 6/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant filed a motion requesting that our ruling in this matter be prepared in a manner that avoids disclosure of her name. A party seeking anonymity must overcome the presumption that parties' identities are public information. <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 11 (2007). Anonymity is granted to litigants before the Board only in unusual circumstances, and the determination whether to grant anonymity depends on the particular facts of each case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A litigant seeking anonymity before the Board must present evidence establishing that harm is likely, not merely possible, if her name is disclosed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserts that anonymity is necessary because her medical condition is at issue in her request for review. However, she has failed to identify any specific harm that would result if her name were disclosed, or otherwise distinguish her situation from the numerous Board decisions in which appellants' medical conditions are discussed. While it is understandable that the appellant wishes to preserve her privacy, she has failed to rebut the presumption that the parties' identities are public information in Board cases. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 19. Therefore, we DENY the appellant's motion requesting anonymity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board announced in 2012 that it was not going to label cases "Jane," but only "John," Doe. There must have been a lot of internal discussion at the Board on the change, but the author is not in the know of the reason for the preference for the masculine Doe. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v.
