<p class="noindent">Administratively uncontrollable overtime is described by <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1613</span>, 68 FLRA 128, 128-29 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AUO is a type of overtime available to certain employees who are in positions that require substantial amounts of "irregular, unscheduled overtime duty."[4] AUO compensation is paid on an annual basis and is determined as "an appropriate percentage, not less than [ten] percent nor more than [twenty-five] percent, of the rate of basic pay for the [employee's] position," based on the number of overtime hours worked.[5] Prior to being denied waivers, the grievants worked enough overtime hours to earn the highest percentage of AUO pay. After the waiver denials, the Agency instructed the grievants to limit their overtime hours so that they would not exceed the lowest percentage of AUO pay. Following the grievants' waiver denials and restrictions on their ability to work AUO, the Union filed a grievance, which went to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2141"></span>[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The connection between administratively uncontrollable overtime and FLSA overtime was explored in <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE Local 5300</span>, 67 FLRA 558, 558-61 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7(a) of the FLSA provides that "employees are entitled to receive overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of [forty] hours in a workweek at a rate of one and one-half times their regular rate."[3] In comparison, AUO is an annual premium payment that may be made to an employee "in a position in which the hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively, and which requires substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require the employee to remain on duty."[4] AUO is paid "as an appropriate percentage, not less than [ten] percent nor more than [twenty-five] percent, of the rate of basic pay for the position."[5] AUO and FLSA overtime are mutually exclusive: when an employee eligible for both works more than eight hours in a day, those hours are either compensated as AUO (if the overtime is irregular, unscheduled work) or FLSA overtime (if the overtime is regularly-scheduled, administratively controllable work).[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A federal LEO eligible for both AUO and FLSA overtime may recover FLSA overtime only by: (1) showing that his or her "supervisor scheduled the overtime in advance of the administrative workweek"; or (2) meeting the fact-specific test set out in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b)(3).[38] Section 610.121(b)(3) provides that an employee is entitled to FLSA overtime if the agency head or a supervisor delegated the power to schedule the employee's overtime "should have scheduled a period of work as part of the employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek and failed to do so."[39] Specifically, an employee must show that the supervisor: (1) "[h]ad knowledge of the specific days and hours of the work requirement in advance of the administrative workweek"; and (2) "had the opportunity to determine which employee had to be scheduled, or rescheduled, to meet the specific days and hours of that work requirement."[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under the Federal Employees Pay Act (FEPA), an employee is entitled to overtime for all hours worked over eight hours in a day or forty hours in a week that are specifically ordered or approved. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a). However, rather than paying an hourly overtime rate, an agency may provide an annual AUO premium to an employee who is required to work overtime hours that cannot be controlled administratively. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(2); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 61 FLRA 741, 742 (2006). When an employee is receiving an AUO premium, AUO is the "sole compensation for irregular and occasional overtime work...." 59 Fed. Reg. 66,149-01, 66,149 (1994). However, employees receiving AUO must still be paid overtime under Title 5 for all "regularly scheduled overtime," as well as all night, Sunday, and holiday pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2142"></span>Regularly scheduled overtime work is defined as "overtime work that is part of an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek," which, in turn, "means the period within an administrative workweek, established in accordance with [5 C.F.R] &#x00A7; 610.111 [(&#x00A7; 610.111)] of this chapter, within which the employee is regularly scheduled to work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.103. Section 610.111 provides that an agency "shall establish by a written agency policy statement" a basic workweek, as well as "the period of regular overtime work, if any, required of each employee."[3] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.111(a)(1)-(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We note that there is no finding or allegation that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.111(b) applies here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FLSA overtime, on the other hand, entitles employees to pay equal to one and a half times their regular rate for all hours over 40 in a week, but does not require hours to be specifically ordered and approved. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a). However, as relevant here, the FLSA provides for a different workweek for law enforcement officers employed by the Federal Government, in this case 42.75 hours.[4] 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(k); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.541(a); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 56 FLRA 992, 994 (2000) (finding that the applicability of &#x00A7; 207(k) "is reflected in the overtime provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.501," and that FLSA overtime is governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.541).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Arbitrator, in his 2007 Award, applied the LEO exception provided in &#x00A7; 207(k). Although the Union, in its opposition, argues that the Agency has not proven that &#x00A7; 207(k) applies, the Union has not filed an exception on this issue and, thus, that issue is not before us. The parties do not dispute that, should &#x00A7; 207(k) apply, the relevant workweek is 42.75 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The 2007 Award is contrary to law. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's 2007 Award is contrary to &#x00A7; 5542(a) and &#x00A7; 551.512(b). According to the Agency, the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 5542(a) because it provided overtime pay for hours of work that are not regularly scheduled.[5] Additionally, the Agency contends that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.512(b) because irregular overtime is included within AUO.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that it is undisputed that the meal periods at issue here are considered hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found the LEOs' meal periods to be regularly scheduled overtime, relying on the fact that the meal periods themselves were neither irregular nor unscheduled. According to the Agency, while it is true that meal periods are regularly scheduled, the relevant question under the statute is whether <span class="Italic">overtime </span>is regularly scheduled. The Agency asserts that the meal periods at issue were not "prescheduled work time" or regularly scheduled overtime, but, rather, were periods when employees could decide that it was necessary to work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[O]vertime that [is] added on to every work day of the year [is] 'irregular' if not ordered and directed according to law." <span class="Italic">Bennett v. United States</span>, 4 Cl. Ct. 330, 343 n.39 (Cl. Ct. 1984). Section 5545(c)(2) provides that employees receiving AUO pay may receive overtime pay for all "regularly scheduled overtime" work, but only if established in accordance with &#x00A7; 610.111. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(2). The Agency did not schedule the overtime work during meal periods in advance in accordance with &#x00A7; 610.111, which, as stated above, requires the Agency to establish regularly scheduled overtime, in advance, in a written policy statement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.111(a)(1)-(2). As a result, the meal periods at issue here were not regularly scheduled overtime. <span class="Italic">See </span>OPM Guidance on Applying FLSA Overtime Provisions to Law Enforcement Employees Receiving Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime Pay, &#x00B6; 14, <a href="http://www.opm.gov/oca/pay/html/flsaovertime.html">http://www.opm.gov/oca/pay/html/flsaovertime.html</a> noting that work performed by employees earning AUO during meal periods "[b]y definition" would be "irregular or occasional overtime work") (OPM Guidance). Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator's 2007 Award granting the LEOs time-and-a-half overtime is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., S. Reg'l Office, Dallas, Tex.</span>, 16 FLRA 1131, 1134 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Burich v. United States</span>, 366 F.2d 984, 988-89 (Ct. Cl. 1966)) (finding work performed with high degree of frequency and regularity legally insufficient to be regularly scheduled overtime).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we grant this exception and modify the award. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Office, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 64 FLRA 535, 538 (2010) (holding that, "[w]here the Authority is able to modify an award to bring it into compliance with applicable law, it will do so"). In this regard, finding that the meal periods are not regularly scheduled overtime does not mean that the LEOs are not paid any FLSA overtime for those hours. <span class="Italic">See </span>OPM Guidance at &#x00B6; 18 (finding that FLSA non-exempt employees earning AUO are entitled to "[o]ne-half times the employee's hourly regular rate times all overtime hours worked"). The Arbitrator found, and the Agency does not dispute, that the LEOs receiving AUO are entitled to one-half times their regular hourly rate for all irregularly scheduled overtime hours, including meal periods. Although the Union is correct that the employees' total overtime pay must be equal to time and a half, because the LEOs already are receiving AUO, the Arbitrator correctly determined that the proper calculation is for them to receive an additional one-half times their regularly hourly rate.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the parties and Arbitrator recognized, the Authority has addressed the legality of "excludable days" for purposes of calculating AUO rates on several previous occasions.[30] In one such recent decision, the Authority described the analytical steps for "determining the eligibility for, and the amount of, AUO pay," consistent with the C.F.R.[31] In the first step of the analysis, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.153(a), an agency must determine whether the nature of a "position in general" is suitable for AUO pay.[32] Here, the parties have not disputed the first step, so we need not discuss it further.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">At the second step of the analysis (second step), under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.153(b), "an agency determines whether an <span class="Italic">individual employee performs</span> the requisite amount of AUO--at least an average of three hours a week."[33] Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.161(f) requires that an agency review its second-step determination "at appropriate intervals."[34] Thus, as relevant here, to be consistent with government-wide regulations, the Arbitrator's award must permit the Agency to verify, at appropriate intervals, that the grievants performed the required average number of AUO hours to maintain their AUO-pay eligibility.[35]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 912-13 (emphasis added) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.153(b) (2015)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency argues that the award fails to satisfy those requirements. Regarding the second step, the Agency contends that the grievants--who did not perform any overtime work for periods of a year or more--necessarily failed to perform at least an average of three hours of AUO per week, as &#x00A7; 550.153(b) requires. And the Agency contends that the award contravenes &#x00A7; 550.161(f) by effectively precluding the Agency from reviewing its second-step determinations for the grievants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned earlier, the Arbitrator found that the Agency could have lawfully excluded the grievants' official-time workdays from its AUO calculations and that, after doing so, the Agency could have properly certified the grievants as eligible for AUO pay. In that regard, the award essentially holds that the Agency should have excluded all of the grievants' workdays from its AUO calculations. Further, the parties stipulated before the Arbitrator--and it remains undisputed--that the grievants did not perform any "irregular or occasional overtime work"[42] for a year or more, and they did not plan to perform overtime work for as long as they maintained their 100% official-time schedules. As a result, the grievants did not have any non-excluded workdays, or any AUO-work performance, that would have supported re-affirming the Agency's prior AUO-rate calculations for them "at appropriate intervals," under &#x00A7; 550.161(f).[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.153(b)(3) (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 550.161(f) (2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, in order for the Agency to have properly certified the grievants as AUO-eligible under &#x00A7; 550.153(b), "[t]here must [have been] a <span class="Italic">definite basis for anticipating</span> that the [grievants'] irregular or occasional overtime work [would] <span class="Italic">continue over an appropriate period</span> with a duration and frequency sufficient to meet the minimum requirements,"[45] including "at least an average of three hours of AUO per week."[46] But because the grievants did not perform overtime work for a year or more, the Agency had no basis--let alone a "definite basis," as &#x00A7; 550.153(b)(3) requires[47]--to anticipate that the grievants would perform the minimum average overtime work necessary to maintain AUO eligibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.153(b)(3) (2015) (emphases added).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the parties' agreement in this case--where the grievants had not performed overtime work for years, and had no plans to return to performing overtime work--is inconsistent with &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.153(b) and 550.161(f). Thus, we set aside the award as contrary to government-wide regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we wish to emphasize the narrow scope of our decision. The Authority has previously recognized that unions may negotiate to exclude certain time periods--for example, "negotiations time"[48]--from an agency's AUO-rate calculations, and we are not rejecting that principle. Unlike this case, however, those prior decisions involved employees who still performed some AUO work during the work year so that, even after excluding official-time work, an agency could base its <span id="page_2143"></span>AUO certifications on AUO-eligible work that the agency had "a definite basis for anticipating"[49] the employees would continue performing.[50] The problems in this case arose from the grievants' desires to exclude all of their workdays from their AUO calculations, and also to receive an overtime premium without performing any overtime work. We emphasize the narrow scope of our decision not, as our concurring colleague inaccurately claims, to "give [an] advisory opinion[ ]." Rather, consistent with judicial practice in similar situations, we discuss how this decision relates to Authority precedent in order to maintain the clarity of our case law, and to help parties avoid misinterpreting this decision in future cases.[52]</p>
