<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-215"><span class="space">c.</span> Defamation; Related Conduct</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bonanova v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 49 MSPR 294, 298-300 (1991), analyzed the agency's burden of proof concerning defamation. Appellant, a GS-12 Equal Opportunity Specialist, was removed on allegations that the appellant told a private-sector complainant whose case he was investigating that the appellant's supervisor interfered with the investigation and pressured the appellant to find in favor of the complainant's employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "defamation" has been defined as "an attack on the reputation of another, that is to say, the unprivileged publication of false statements which naturally and proximately result in injury to another." 53 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Libel and Slander</span> 2 (1987) (footnotes omitted). Words that "produce any perceptible injury to the reputation of another, either generally or with respect to a person's occupation are called 'defamatory.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnotes omitted). In addition, a communication that "tends so to harm the reputation of another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or to deter third persons from associating or dealing with him, or...tends to expose him to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule" is defamatory....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Slander is defined as defamation by oral expressions or transitory gestures. Black's Law Dictionary 1244 (5th ed. 1979), citing Restatement, Second, Torts, 658. The essential elements of slander include the following: (a) A false and defamatory statement concerning another; (b) an unprivileged communication; and (c) fault amounting at least to negligence on the part of the publisher. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1244. Whether the plaintiff in a slander action must show actual harm depends on the character of the defamatory statement. When the statement tends to injure a party in his trade, business, office, or occupation, it constitutes slander <span class="Italic">per se</span>, and it therefore requires no proof of special damages....&#8197;Liability for defamation generally cannot arise unless there is "fault amounting to at least negligence on the part of the person making the statement." 53 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Libel and Slander</span>, 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2735"></span>The administrative judge found in her initial decision, and we agree, that the statements at issue were false. She also found that they impugned the integrity of the agency and its mission, a finding equivalent to one that the statements were defamatory and tended to injure the agency's "business." In addition, she found that: The appellant "knew, or should have known, that he had no authority to find that UCLA violated the Civil Rights Act"; he knew or should have known that the decision regarding the handling and disposition of the Amack case rested with the regional Director; and he violated his "professional duty to conduct himself in an impartial and prudent manner." These findings, in effect, constitute findings that the appellant was at least negligent in making the statements at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only element of slander the administrative judge did not address implicitly in her initial decision concerns the question of whether the appellant's statements were privileged. We find, however, that the record provides a sufficient basis for our review of this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's conduct is not privileged merely because it concerns someone else's discrimination complaint. We have previously recognized that not all conduct related to an employee's opposition to discrimination is immune from discipline....&#8197;In cases such as this, we must balance the purpose of the statutory provisions affording protection from discrimination against Congress's equally manifest desire not to tie the hands of employers in the objective control of personnel....&#8197;The appellant's defamatory statements concerning the agency go beyond the bounds of activity afforded protection under the statutory provisions intended to remedy discrimination. As the administrative judge found, the appellant's statements impugned the agency's integrity, thereby harming the employer's interest....&#8197;We therefore find that the appellant's statements constitute a nonprivileged communication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the charge of making slanderous and defamatory statements is supported by the evidence of record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to statements made in internal agency grievance proceedings, <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 194 (1984), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The presiding official found that of the four communications, one was written pursuant to a procedure mandated by statute and regulation, and at least two, if not all three, of the others were written in the context of appellant's internal grievance. She also concluded that, since the latter three communications were made in an atmosphere of quasi-judicial proceedings, the comments contained therein were privileged against claims of libel asserted by the agency.[3] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Leveritt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 5 MSPB 224, 226 (1981), the Board concluded that as long as allegedly libelous statements were kept within the employee-initiated EEO process and were not published beyond the confines of that process, an absolute privilege for such allegedly libelous statements would attach. In <span class="Italic">Leveritt,</span> the appellant published statements outside the EEO process and the privilege did not attach to those statements.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Krennrich v. United States</span>, 340 F.2d 653, 654 (Ct. Cl. 1965), sustained dismissal of an employee who sent anonymous letters disparaging others in the workplace:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's first contention is that she could not be disciplined or removed on this charge unless the agency determined that the statements in her letters were in fact false. We reject this argument. The sending of anonymous letters of this type to superiors, to fellow employees, and certainly to the wife of a fellow employee, is, in itself, good cause for removal under the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 652(a), regardless of whether the anonymous accusations, phrased as these were, have any element of truth. These were not open or responsible accusations of official misconduct, properly and temperately made to the cognizant persons, but were snide and intemperate name-calling attacks in unsigned letters--one of them to the wife of a fellow employee plaintiff accused, in effect, of breaking his marriage vows. Such communications have no place, no sanction, and no privilege in federal employment. It promotes the efficiency of the government service to discipline employees using these methods....&#8197;The Federal Aviation Agency's Employee's Handbook permitted removal as a consequence of "making false, vicious, or malicious statements concerning another officer or employee of the Government," and we cannot say that the Agency abused its discretion in imposing that penalty on plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 394-95 &#x00B6; 40 (2004), sustained a charge of unprofessional conduct when, in response to a request for a critique of an agency official's presentation, the appellant "crossed the line when she used language that was insulting and name-calling in nature." <span class="Italic">Hinds v. DHS</span>, DC-0752-12-0294-I-1 (NP 12/17/2013), sustained a charge of unprofessional conduct based on statements lacking in candor to investigators concerning allegedly inappropriate conduct of other employees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Memos questioning the competency of a coworker, determined to be libelous with possible repercussions for the employee, coupled with six months of loud and disruptive behavior showing an inability to get along with coworkers, warranted removal. An employee is expected to comport himself in accordance with acceptable workplace standards. <span class="Italic">Zara v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 24 MSPR 693, 698 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers</span>, 461 U.S. 138 (1983). Creating anonymous cartoons and other writings lampooning supervisors, and then lying about the authorship of those drawings during an investigation, warranted removal. <span class="Italic">Martinez and Gomez v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3001); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wittenberg v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 617, 620 (1981) (as to an adverse action taken against an employee who circulated a newsletter about the agency and certain named members of management: "[T]here is a clear difference between this general 'puffery' language commonly engaged in by unions and the content of appellant's 'newsletter' which contained willful, disparaging, and demeaning attacks upon named supervisors with whom appellant is in daily contact").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 137, 145-46 (1989), the employee was suspended for providing a member of the public with a memo, of some undefined interest to the recipient, written to the appellant's supervisor, alleged to have falsely charged the agency and another employee with discrimination. The memo was released contrary to the supervisor's instructions. The appellant was then charged with violation of agency standards of conduct prohibiting employees from taking any action that would adversely affect the confidence of the public in the government. Noting that proof of an actual loss of public confidence was not necessary to sustain the charge, the Board concluded that the mailing of the memorandum adversely and directly affected public confidence in the integrity of the agency. The memo, although concerning a matter of public concern, was unprotected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The determination of whether a public employer has properly disciplined an employee for engaging in speech requires "a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees." <span class="Italic">Rankin v. McPherson,</span> 483 U.S. 378, 107 S. Ct. 2891, 2896, 97 L. Ed.2d 315 (1987), citing <span class="Italic">Pickering v.</span> <span class="Italic">Board of Education,</span> 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 1734-35, 20 L. Ed.2d 811 (1968). The threshold question in applying this balancing test is whether the affected employee's speech may be "fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern." <span class="Italic">Rankin,</span> 483 U.S. at 384, 107 S. Ct. at 2896-97, citing <span class="Italic">Connick v. Myers,</span> 461 U.S. 138, 146, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 1689, 75 L. Ed.2d 708 (1983). Speech involves a matter of public concern if it addresses items of "political, social, or other concern to the community," but not if it addresses only internal agency grievances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mings v. Department of Justice,</span> 813 F.2d at 388, citing <span class="Italic">Connick</span>, 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S. Ct. at 1690. The entire document must be considered in making this determination. <span class="Italic">See Mings,</span> 813 F.2d at 388.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, because the appellant's remarks about a fellow employee and the agency constituted a continuation of his challenge to what he perceived to be discriminatory practices by the agency against him and all other blacks, it did not involve a matter of public concern. We disagree. Although the report was concerned primarily with the agency's handling of Mr. Henderson's account, a matter of internal agency policy, the report also addressed what the appellant perceived to be disparities in the agency's procedures operating to the detriment of black applicants. Accordingly, we find that the comments made in the appellant's report involved a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">Cf. Oliver v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 465, 470 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (table) (allegations of the agency's disparity in awarding grants to the detriment of minorities and of general insensitivity toward minority participants in the program constituted protected disclosures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's error was harmless under the circumstances, however, because she correctly went on to find that the agency's interest in promoting the efficiency of the service outweighed the appellant's right to free speech.[2] <span class="Italic">Cf. Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114, 6 MSPR 124, 127 (1981) (the administrative judge's error is of no legal consequence unless it is shown that it has adversely affected a party's substantive rights). Insubordination is a serious offense which undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jefferson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 6 MSPB 297, 6 MSPR 348, 352 (1981). Moreover, the agency's interest in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of its operations was directly affected by the nature of the appellant's misconduct here--i.e., the appellant's act of mailing an internal agency memorandum to a member of the public undermined the agency's confidence in the appellant's ability to deal effectively with members of the public, and had a significantly negative impact on the agency's image in the eyes of the community. We therefore agree with the administrative judge, and find that the agency's interest in efficiency and discipline outweighs any matter of public concern addressed by the appellant's report. <span class="Italic">See Mings,</span> 813 F.2d at 389; <span class="Italic">Oliver,</span> 34 MSPR at 474-75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;[T]he appellant could have both exercised his right to free <span id="Page_2736"></span>speech and not been insubordinate or in violation of agency regulations if he had simply brought his allegation of discrimination to the attention of appropriate officials, such as the agency's Inspector General or the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, the EEOC left undisturbed the Board's decision, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Abdnor,</span> EEOC 03890078 (July 25, 1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... To assert a claim that he was disparately treated in retaliation for his prior EEO activities, petitioner must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination. In order to set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal, petitioner has a burden of showing that: (1) he engaged in protected activity under Title VII; (2) the agency was aware of the protected activity; (3) he was subsequently subjected to adverse action by the agency; and (4) absent other evidence tending to establish retaliatory motivation, the adverse action followed the protected activity within such a period of time that retaliatory motivation can be inferred. <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology,</span> 425 Supp. 318 (D. Mass. 1976), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Commission finds that petitioner has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of reprisal discrimination, but that he has failed to show that the agency's reasons for his suspension were a pretext for reprisal discrimination. Although it is clear that petitioner has been an active participant in the EEO process and that his supervisors were aware of this activity, the inference of reprisal discrimination is sufficiently eradicated by the agency's explanation that petitioner was removed for insubordination (as noted in our discussion of the race discrimination allegation), so as to render insufficient petitioner's attempts to show pretext.</p>
