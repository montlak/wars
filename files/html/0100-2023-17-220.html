<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-218"><span class="space">h.</span> Duration of Back Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">OPM government-wide regulations effectively limit to 120 days the duration of a temporary promotion that is not made through competitive selection procedures. 5 CFR 335.103(c) (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Covered personnel actions</span>--(1) <span class="Italic">Competitive actions</span>. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, competitive procedures in agency promotion plans apply to all promotions under &#x00A7; 335.102 of this part and to the following actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Time-limited promotions under &#x00A7; 335.102(f) of this part for more than 120 days to higher graded positions (prior service during the preceding 12 months under noncompetitive time-limited promotions and noncompetitive details to higher graded positions counts toward the 120-day total). A temporary promotion may be made permanent without further competition provided the temporary promotion was originally made under competitive procedures and the fact that might lead to a permanent promotion was made known to all potential candidates;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Details for more than 120 days to a higher grade position or to a position with higher promotion potential (prior service during the preceding 12 months under noncompetitive details to higher graded positions and noncompetitive time-limited promotions counts toward the 120-day total);</p>
<p class="noindent">The OPM regulations, &#x00A7; 335.103(c) apply to temporary, not permanent, promotions. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 3</span>, 60 FLRA 742, 745 (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming an award of a temporary promotion, OPM regulations preclude the higher pay accompanying that promotion for a period of more than 120 days unless the position was competed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 667, 669-70 (2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2092"></span>In <span class="Italic">DVA</span> [<span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C., </span>60 FLRA 46 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Pope concurring)], the arbitrator concluded that the grievant had performed the duties of a higher-graded position from July 1999 to February 2002 and that under the parties' collective bargaining agreement, she should have been temporarily promoted. Accordingly, he directed the agency to temporarily promote the grievant retroactively to the higher grade effective August 1999 to February 2002.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the agency contended that the arbitrator's award of a retroactive temporary promotion in excess of 120 days without competition was contrary to &#x00A7; 335.103(c). The Authority requested an advisory opinion from OPM on the applicability of the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) that competitive procedures apply to promotions exceeding 120 days, and, if the requirements apply, on the effect they have on the arbitral remedy of a retroactive temporary promotion exceeding 120 days. OPM advised that "5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) applies." 60 FLRA at 47<span class="Italic"> </span>(quoting OPM Opinion at 1). OPM emphasized that the regulations leave no doubt that time-limited promotions of more than 120 days must be made pursuant to competition under an agency merit promotion plan and that consequently, the arbitrator's order of a retroactive temporary promotion in excess of the regulatory cap of 120 days was contrary to &#x00A7; 335.103(c). <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority ruled that the union had failed to establish that OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 335.103(c) was "plainly erroneous or inconsistent" with the language of &#x00A7; 335.103(c) and that consequently, the Authority would rely on OPM's advisory opinion in determining whether the award was contrary to &#x00A7; 335.103. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 49 (quoting <span class="Italic">FLRA v. United States Dep't of the Treasury, Fin. Mgmt. Serv., </span>884 F.2d 1446, 1454 (D.C. Cir. 1989)). Applying OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 335.103(c), the Authority concluded that the award was deficient to the extent that it awarded a retroactive temporary promotion without competition for a period in excess of 120 days. In addition, the Authority ruled that because the awarded promotion was without competition, there was no personnel action that resulted in a reduction in pay and that consequently, the grievant was not entitled to backpay in excess of 120 days. The Authority also stated that "to the extent that Authority precedent would support a conclusion that the award in the circumstances presented here is not inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c), it will no longer be followed." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 50.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">DVA</span>, we conclude that the Arbitrator's backpay remedy in this case is deficient to the extent that it exceeds 120 days.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DVA, </span>OPM advised that temporary promotions of more than 120 days must be made pursuant to competition and that an arbitrator's award of a temporary promotion in excess of the regulatory cap of 120 days is contrary to &#x00A7; 335.103(c). The Union argues that <span class="Italic">DVA</span> does not apply and that the Arbitrator's monetary remedy is not contrary to &#x00A7; 335.103(c) because the Arbitrator "did not expressly...temporarily promote the grievant[.] We reject this argument because a retroactive temporary promotion, whether express, constructive, or implied, is essential to an award of backpay for the performance of the duties of a higher-graded position to which the grievant was never appointed. <span class="Italic">See Spagnola v. Stockman, </span>732 F.2d 908, 910, 912 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Moreover, in<span class="Italic"> Norfolk Naval Shipyard, </span>on which the Union relies, the Authority acknowledged that effecting retroactive temporary promotions may be necessary to comply with an award of backpay in these cases. <span class="Italic">See Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 55 FLRA at 1016 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A provision in a collective bargaining agreement establishing the requisite mandatory promotion is enforceable only to the extent consistent with civil service regulations pertaining to temporary promotions.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Army, New Cumberland Army Depot, </span>21 FLRA 968, 972 (1986). OPM's advisory opinion in <span class="Italic">DVA </span>places a "regulatory cap of 120 days" on retroactive temporary promotions awarded by arbitrators without competition. 60 FLRA at 47. As such, there can be no award of backpay for a period exceeding the 120-day limitation. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 50. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's backpay remedy is deficient to the extent that it exceeds 120 days</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on other Authority precedent, such as <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard,</span> is misplaced. Such precedent preceded OPM's advisory opinion in <span class="Italic">DVA</span> and the Authority's determination in <span class="Italic">DVA </span>to no longer follow prior precedent that would support a conclusion that awards, such as the award in this case, were not inconsistent with &#x00A7; 335.103(c). We also reject the Union's claim that the award should be upheld because precluding a financial remedy is "unfair" to employees. The Union has provided no authority to support a conclusion that whether &#x00A7; 335.103(c), as interpreted by OPM, is "fair" is relevant in this context. Moreover, as noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Stockman</span>, the lack of a financial remedy does not prevent an action to compel the employing agency to return the employee to work at the employee's appointed level after the allowable period of a detail has ended. <span class="Italic">See </span>732 F.2d at 912.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's claim that OPM's interpretation is plainly erroneous provides no basis for the Authority to reconsider its determination in <span class="Italic">DVA</span> to defer to the interpretation. The Union primarily argues that OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 335.103(c) is inconsistent with OPM's regulations implementing the Back Pay Act and authorizing the making of an employee financially whole. However, as noted above, there can be no entitlement to backpay for the performance of the duties of a higher-graded position for more than 120 days without a competitive promotion. Consequently, there is no inconsistency between OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 335.103(c) and OPM's regulations in 5 C.F.R. part 550, subpart H, implementing the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Port St. Lucie Dist. and AFGE Local 2014,</span> 64 FLRA 552, 554-55 (2010), also applied the 120-day regulatory limitation on backpay for a noncompetitive temporary promotion award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM has interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c) as requiring that time-limited promotions of more than 120 days be made pursuant to competition under an agency merit-promotion plan. <span class="Italic">VA Charleston</span>, 60 FLRA at 49. Deferring to this interpretation, the Authority has concluded that a retroactive temporary promotion of more than 120 days cannot be awarded in the absence of competitive procedures. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In accordance with this interpretation, backpay for a retroactive, noncompetitive temporary promotion that exceeds 120 days is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c). <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator awarded the grievants backpay for a period of almost three years.&#x2003;There is no indication from his findings, and the Union does not allege, that the temporary promotions were made based on competitive procedures. Therefore, <span class="Italic">VA Charleston </span>supports a conclusion that the Arbitrator's backpay remedy requires modification because, to the extent that it exceeds 120 days, it is deficient as contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c). Because we decline the Union's request to reconsider <span class="Italic">VA Charleston</span>, we grant the Agency's exception and modify the backpay award to 120 days for each grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the award should be remanded to the Arbitrator to determine whether one of the grievants is entitled to an additional 120-day period of back pay. However, the Arbitrator found that the grievants were assigned to work in the CDR Unit in 2001, and although he noted that the grievants were sometimes absent from work, he did not find that their assignments were ever renewed. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">VA Charleston</span>, there is no "basis for concluding that the Arbitrator intended the award to encompass" more than one temporary promotion for each grievant. <span class="Italic">VA Charleston</span>, 60 FLRA at 50. Accordingly, we deny the Union's request for remand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 61 FLRA 667, 669-70 (2006) (adhering to 120-day limitation, following <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Washington and AFGE Local 2798</span>, 67 FLRA 194, 197-98 (2014), declined to depart from the OPM regulation or the OPM interpretation of the regulation limiting noncompetitive temporary promotions to 120 days:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of VA, Ralph H. Johnson Medical Center, Charleston, South Carolina (VA)</span>, the Authority sought an advisory opinion from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regarding whether a noncompetitive promotion for more than 120 days would violate 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c).[43] In its advisory opinion, OPM interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c) as requiring that time-limited promotions of more than 120 days be made under competitive procedures, consistent with agencies' merit-promotion plans. Deferring to this interpretation, the Authority concluded that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c), arbitrators may not award retroactive, temporary promotions of more than 120 days without applying competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;60 FLRA 46, 49 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss and then-Member Pope separately concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that a Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) decision found that OPM's advisory opinion is not a "rule" and is not binding on the Authority. For this reason, the Union claims that the Authority should no longer follow <span class="Italic">VA</span> or OPM's advisory opinion. The Union does not provide the Authority with a citation to the MSPB case upon which it relies, and it is not clear what decision it is citing. However, we address the Union's claim to the extent it argues that the Authority should no longer follow <span class="Italic">VA</span> and should no longer defer to OPM's interpretation of its own regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority follows the practice of the federal courts and generally affords deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, giving the interpretation "controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation."[48] However, the Authority declines to defer to an agency's "litigative positions."[49] Accordingly, for an agency's interpretation to be entitled to deference, the interpretation must have been publicly articulated prior to "litigation."[50] In that <span id="page_2093"></span>regard, an interpretation articulated prior to litigation "is in no sense a '<span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizatio[n]' advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack...[and] there is simply no reason to suspect that the interpretation does not reflect the agency's fair and considered judgment on the matter in question."[51]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Title 5, &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(ii) of the Code of Federal Regulations states that "competitive procedures...apply to...[d]etails for more than 120 days to a higher[-]grade position." OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c) discussed above--requiring that time-limited promotions of more than 120 days be made under competitive procedures consistent with an agency's merit-promotion plan--is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(ii). Further, OPM was not a litigant in <span class="Italic">VA</span>--it merely responded to the Authority's request for an advisory opinion--and there is no basis for finding that OPM's interpretation was advanced to defend its past action against attack. We recognize that OPM's interpretation may create an incentive for agencies to violate the regulation (in that an agency that ignores competitive procedures cannot be required to pay employees for higher-graded duties performed in excess of 120 days, while an agency that complies with competitive procedures presumably can). Nevertheless, applying the foregoing, the Union has failed to establish that OPM's interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the regulation. Accordingly, we find that OPM's opinion is entitled to our deference.[53]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator awarded the grievant a retroactive, temporary promotion and backpay for a period of about six months. The Arbitrator did not find, and the Union does not allege, that the temporary promotion was made based on competitive procedures. Therefore, the Arbitrator's backpay remedy requires modification because, to the extent that it exceeds 120 days, it is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c).[54] For this reason, we grant the Agency's exception in part and modify the backpay award to limit it to 120 days.[55]</p>

When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo.</span>[15] In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law.[16] In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings unless the excepting party establishes that they are nonfacts.[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award is not deficient for two reasons. First, the issue before the Arbitrator involved "temporary assignments," not temporary promotions. Second, the Arbitrator had the authority to make the grievants whole under the parties' agreement and the Back Pay Act. However, the Authority has found that "a retroactive temporary promotion, whether express, constructive, or implied, is essential to an award of backpay for the performance of the duties of a higher-graded position to which the grievant was never appointed."[20] And, the Authority has applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) to grievances alleging violations of contract provisions governing "temporary assignments."[21] Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievants performed the duties of a higher-graded position. Because the Union did not except to that finding, it has failed to establish that the issue before the Arbitrator involved a temporary assignment.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, an award granting a temporary promotion is enforceable only to the extent that it is consistent with civil service regulations pertaining to such promotions.[24] On this point, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management has interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) as requiring that time-limited promotions that exceed 120 days must be competed under an agency merit-promotion plan.[25] Deferring to this interpretation, the Authority has concluded that a retroactive temporary promotion and associated backpay of more than 120 days cannot be awarded unless the promotion was filled competitively.[26] Here, no evidence has established that the temporary promotion was competed. Therefore, to the extent that the backpay remedy exceeds 120 days, it is contrary to law.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 78,</span> 63 FLRA 567, 572 (2009), the arbitrator required the agency to grant a series of nonconsecutive 120-day temporary promotions, creatively and effectively meeting the strictures of OPM requirements on a temporary promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the remedy awarded by the Arbitrator is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) and <span class="Italic">VA</span> [<span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr., Charleston, S.C., </span>60 FLRA 46 (2004)] because it requires the Agency to grant a retroactive temporary promotion for more than 120 days without the use of competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 335.103(c)(1)(i) requires competitive actions for certain "[t]ime-limited promotions...for more than 120 days to higher graded positions...." In the instant case, the Arbitrator ordered "multiple non-consecutive 120 day[s'] promotions, each one separated by a 12 month period[ ]" to address the Agency's action in assigning the grievants a "series of temporary promotions" over a period of time. Thus, as directed, the remedy does not require the Agency to grant a retroactive temporary promotion for more than 120 days. Rather, the award requires the Agency to grant multiple temporary promotions for 120 days, each separated by one year, as appropriate, for each grievant. As such, the award does not require the Agency to grant an employee a temporary promotion for more than 120 days. Accordingly, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">VA</span> provides no basis for finding the award deficient. In <span class="Italic">VA,</span> the Authority found that an award, to the extent that it ordered a retroactive temporary promotion that exceeded 120 days, was deficient because it was inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i). In so finding, the Authority rejected the union's request that the award be remanded for a determination on whether it should be properly considered as a '"string of noncompetitive shorter appointment[s]"' finding that the union had not established any basis for concluding that the arbitrator intended the award to encompass such a series of promotions. <span class="Italic">VA.,</span> 60 FLRA at 50 (quoting union's response). The type of remedy involved in this case--120 days' promotions separated by 12 months periods--was not awarded or otherwise addressed in <span class="Italic">VA.</span> As such, <span class="Italic">VA</span> provides no basis for finding the instant award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3) because it does not require the grievants to meet OPM's minimum qualifications for promotion and time-in-grade requirements, provided in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.604(b). This claim provides no basis for finding the award deficient. In this regard, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3) provides that in order to be eligible for promotion candidates must "meet the minimum qualification standards prescribed by [OPM]" and the time-in-grade requirements provided in "part 300." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.1O3(b)(3). In this case, because the "effect" of the directed remedy could not be determined from the record, the Arbitrator did not apply the remedy to each grievant, but "remanded" the matter to the parties to determine when a grievant began performing <span id="page_2094"></span>higher-graded duties and the amount of back pay due the grievant. As the award leaves it to the parties to determine the amount of back pay due, as appropriate for each grievant, there is no basis to conclude that the award requires the Agency to grant temporary promotions contrary to the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3). Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under preexisting regulations of OPM, a temporary promotion could be made for up to a year, and renewed for a year, without competition. 5 CFR 335.102(f)(1) (1990). An arbitrator could, under those regulations, require a temporary promotion be awarded to remedy a contract violation for up to two years. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 44 FLRA 147, 152 (1992). An award that ordered a grievant temporarily promoted for a period of longer than two years would be modified because, without formal OPM approval, the maximum period for a temporary promotion and extension of the promotion is two years. The modification may include a directive to the agency to request formal approval from OPM for the added period of the temporary promotion. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, New Cumberland Army Depot and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 21 FLRA 968, 972 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 43 FLRA 915, 919 (1992); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 43 FLRA 633, 636-37 (1991); <span class="Italic">Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 42 FLRA 886, 899 (1991); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 42 FLRA 680, 684-85 (1991). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R3-35 and VAMC Coatesville</span>, 52 FLRA 866, 871-72 (1997) (1993 version of 5 CFR 335.102(f) established five-year prospective limit on duration of temporary promotions, unless OPM authorizes extension).
