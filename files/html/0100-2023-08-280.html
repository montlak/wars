<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-275"><span class="space">2.</span> Time for USERRA Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Board Regulations set no time limits for the appeal of cases under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 65 Fed. Reg. 5409 (2/4/00). 5 CFR 1201.22 (2022) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time of filing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. Where an appellant and an agency mutually agree in writing to attempt to resolve their dispute through an alternative dispute resolution process prior to the timely filing of an appeal, however, the time limit for filing the appeal is extended by an additional 30 days--for a total of 60 days. A response to an appeal must be filed within 20 days of the date of the Board's acknowledgment order. The time for filing a submission under this section is computed in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.23 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit. No time limit applies to appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Pub. L. 103-353), as amended; <span class="Italic">see</span> part 1208 of this title. <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1208 of this <span id="Page_458"></span>title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to appeals under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Pub. L. 105-339). <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1209 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to whistleblower appeals and stay requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 64 Fed. Reg. 54507 (10/7/1999), the Board explained the rationale for abandoning preexisting Board regulatory time limits governing filing of USERRA claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Comments were received from two Federal agencies, both of which have significant responsibilities under USERRA. The Office of Personnel Management supported the interim rule, as published, citing in particular its support for the establishment of time limits for filing a USERRA appeal with MSPB. (The Preamble to the interim rule explained that the Board is authorized by 5 USC 1204(h) to promulgate regulations to carry out its functions, that the Board has used this authority since its inception to prescribe time limits for filing appeals with the Board, and that the Board is also authorized by 38 USC 4331(b)(2)(A) to promulgate regulations to carry out its functions under USERRA.) The OPM comments noted that the establishment of time limits would avoid matters becoming stale, while adequately safeguarding the procedural rights of Federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Labor, on the other hand, objected to the establishment of time limits for filing USERRA appeals. In support of its position, the Department cited the broad remedial purpose of USERRA and the stated intent of Congress that Federal employees be provided protections comparable to those afforded employees of State and private employers. The Department pointed out the specific prohibition on application of any State statute of limitations to claims brought against State or private employers (38 USC 4323(c)(6), now 38 USC 4323(i) as amended by the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998). The Department argued that, rather than imposing time limits on the filing of USERRA claims, the Board should apply the equitable doctrine of laches to claims brought by Federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board was evaluating these comments, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3213, the USERRA Amendments Act of 1998. This bill included a provision (section 4) that would require the Board to adjudicate any USERRA claim filed on or after October 13, 1994 (the enactment date of USERRA) "without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994." Subsequently, both the House and Senate passed H.R. 4110, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, which incorporated the language of section 4 of H.R. 3213 as section 213. (The other provisions of H.R. 3213 became sections 211 and 212 of H.R. 4110.) The President signed H.R. 4110 on November 11, 1998, Public Law 105-368. Under this amendment to USERRA, the time limits in the Board's interim rule clearly could not be applied to USERRA complaints that accrued prior to October 13, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of both the 1998 USERRA amendments and the comments on the interim rule submitted by the Department of Labor, the Board undertook an extensive review of the history of veterans reemployment rights law. From this review, the Board has concluded that it would be inconsistent with the intent of Congress for the Board to exercise its regulatory authority to establish a time limitation on the filing of claims by Federal employees under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The prohibition on State statutes of limitation in USERRA is carried over from an earlier law, the 1974 Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act. Section 404 of that law, which created Chapter 43 of Title 38, is commonly referred to as the Veterans Reemployment Rights Act (VRR Act). The legislative history makes clear Congress' preference for the application of laches in VRR cases. The Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 907, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. at 111 (1974) (emphasis added) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is also added a provision at the end of this section which reaffirms and reflects more clearly the congressional intent that legal proceedings under this chapter shall be governed by equity principles of law, specifically by barring the application of State statutes of limitations to any such proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress, in 1940, omitted any reference to the application of a time-barred defense in cases arising under this law, in part to insure the application of a policy of keeping enforcement rights available to returned veterans as uniform as possible throughout the country. The equity doctrine of laches accomplishes the purpose as nearly as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Therefore, those court decisions which have either applied a State statute of limitations to completely bar a claim under the prior law (<span class="Italic">see</span> e.g. <span class="Italic">Blair v. Paige Aircraft Maintenance, Inc.</span>, 467 F.2d 815 (1972) (Alabama 1-year statute of limitations); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Aerodex, Inc.</span>, 473 F.2d 869 (5th Cir. 1973) (Florida 1-year statute of limitations) or have applied a State statute of limitations to partially bar a claim under the prior law (<span class="Italic">see</span> e.g. <span class="Italic">Gruca v. United States Steel Corp.</span>, (No. 73-1803 3d Cir. decided April 17, 1974); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Continental Airlines, Inc.</span>, 70 CCH Labor Cases 13,501 (C.I.), Calif. 1973) are not in accord with the intent of Congress as to the application of time-barred defenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress did not include either in the 1974 law or in USERRA in 1994 an explicit prohibition on the application of a Federal time limitation to veterans reemployment rights claims brought by Federal employees. Congress' silence regarding applying Federal statutes of limitation to veterans reemployment cases, however, is not necessarily determinative. In <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Hardee's of Oxford</span>, 874 F. Supp. 374, 376 (M.D. Ala. 1995), the court rejected Hardee's argument that if Congress intended to preempt use of Federal statutes of limitation it would not have barred only State statutes of limitation. The court noted that "the Act's silence can be explained on the basis that Congress enacted the bar on State statutes of limitations specifically to overrule case law on that issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Because, to the court's knowledge, there was no case law borrowing from Federal statutes of limitations in the veterans' reemployment area, there would have been no reason for Congress to enact a statute on that subject. In this situation, Congress's silence on borrowing from Federal statutes of limitation cannot be determinative." <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 874 F. Supp. at 376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other courts considering time limits in veterans reemployment matters have applied laches. In <span class="Italic">Farries v. Stanadyne/Chicago Div.</span>, 832 F.2d 374, 379-80 (7th Cir. 1987), the court applied laches to a VRR Act claim, relying on the Senate Report language cited above indicating that legal proceedings under the Act are to be governed by equitable principles, including the doctrine of laches. In <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 712 F.2d 1047, 1056-57 (6th Cir. 1983), the court applied laches to a veterans reemployment rights matter (cited with approval in the USERRA legislative history, H.R. Rep. No. 65, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. at 39 (1993)). In <span class="Italic">Goodman v. McDonnell-Douglas Corp.</span>, 606 F.2d 800, 805 (8th Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 446 U.S. 913 (1980), the court applied laches in a VRR Act case, concluding that analogous statutes of limitation are only one element in determining "whether the length of delay was unreasonable and whether the potential for prejudice was great." The court found that this approach is consistent with the purpose of the doctrine of laches and congressional intent to protect veterans' reemployment rights<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA broadened both the substantive and procedural rights of veterans. The legislative history does not distinguish between those rights in noting a congressional intent to construe the Act broadly but directs that the Act be treated as "an organic whole." The House Report at 19 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * the extensive body of case law that has evolved over (the fifty years of legislation regarding veterans employment and reemployment rights), to the extent that it is consistent with the provisions of this Act, remains in full force and effect in interpreting these provisions. This is particularly true of the basic principle established by the Supreme Court that the Act is to be "liberally construed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The House Report cites two Supreme Court cases for its principle of liberal construction<span class="Italic">. Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corp.</span>, 328 U.S. 275 (1946), interprets the provision of the Selective Service Act requiring that, upon return from military service, an employee is to be restored without loss of seniority. Noting that the Act is to be liberally construed, the Court stated that it must "construe the separate provisions of the Act as parts of an organic whole and give each as liberal a construction for the benefit of the veteran as a harmonious interplay of the separate provisions permits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 285 (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Alabama Power Co. v. Davis</span>, 431 U.S. 585 (1977), the Court, citing <span class="Italic">Fishgold</span>, held that the Military Selective Service Act should be construed broadly to enable an employee to accumulate pension benefits while on military duty, as long as there is "reasonable certainty" that he would have accumulated those benefits had he stayed at his job<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 591-92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the broad remedial purpose of USERRA, the mandate for its liberal <span id="Page_459"></span>construction, the stated intent of Congress that Federal employees be provided protections comparable to those afforded employees of State and private employers, the stated intent of Congress that the Federal Government serve as a model employer, the 1998 amendment extending the Board's jurisdiction to complaints that accrued prior to the USERRA effective date, and the legislative history and judicial construction of veterans' reemployment rights law reviewed above, the Board has concluded that application of a time limitation to Federal employees' USERRA claims would be inconsistent with congressional intent.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">64 Fed. Reg. 54,508 (1999). For this reason and on equitable grounds, we find that this case should be remanded for the AJ to consider the appellant's claims on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court provides additional support for this disposition. In <span class="Italic">Landgraf v. USI Film Products,</span> 511 U.S. 244, 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed.2d 229 (1994), the Court stated that a tribunal should apply the rule in effect when it renders its decision, unless it is determined that doing so would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule in effect when the Board is disposing of the instant petition for review is that there is no deadline for filing a USERRA claim with the Board. 5 C.F.R., &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(2); 64 Fed. Reg. 54,508 (1999). The 180-day interim deadline was not part of the agency's substantive rights when it took the actions the appellant claims were discriminatory, considering the case on the merits would not increase the agency's liability because it was illegal to discriminate against veterans when the agency acted, and the new rule does not impose any duties. Thus, applying this new rule would not work an impermissible retroactivity, because it would not "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Landgraf,</span> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 276 n.30, 114 S. Ct. 1483, the Court also reasoned that: "[T]he government should accord grace to private parties disadvantaged by an old rule when it adopts a new and more generous one." The Court cited <span class="Italic">Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham</span>, 393 U.S. 268, 89 S. Ct. 518, 21 L. Ed.2d 474 (1969), as being "consistent" with this principle. <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, 511 U.S. at 276 n.30, 114 S. Ct. 1483. In <span class="Italic">Thorpe,</span> 393 U.S. at 283, 89 S. Ct. 518, the Court held that a Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development circular requiring a local housing authority to give notice of reasons and an opportunity to respond before evicting a tenant applied to an eviction proceeding that began before the regulation was issued. The Court reasoned that, among other things, the eviction proceeding was not a "mere private case[ ] between individuals," but instead involved "national concerns...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 282, 89 S. Ct. 518 (citation omitted). Similarly, here, the appellant was disadvantaged by the old rule, i.e., the 180-day filing deadline, and this is not a mere private case between individuals.</p>

VA,</span> PH-3443-14-0849-I-1 n.5 (NP 5/15/2015) ("Furthermore, the agency's argument that the appeal was untimely is inapplicable to a USERRA appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">Although there may be no time limit for filing a USERRA appeal, if an appeal is filed and the Board imposes time limits on the initiation or reinitiation of other subsequent proceedings in the appeal, e.g., an enforcement petition, that time limit is properly enforced by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Tully v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that imposition of a deadline by which the appeal must be refiled is not warranted in this case. Not only is there no deadline for filing a USERRA appeal in the first instance, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12, but an appropriate deadline would be difficult to establish here in light of the uncertainty as to the length of time required to obtain documents and other information from DFAS and, if necessary, the agency.
