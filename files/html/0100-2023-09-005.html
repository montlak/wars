<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-6"><span class="space">3.</span> Filing Regulation; Electronic Filing; Technical Difficulties</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.22 (2022), prescribes the process for filing a Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Filing an appeal and responses to appeals.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Place of filing. Appeals, and responses to those appeals, must be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1201.4(d) of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Time of filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. Where an appellant and an agency mutually agree in writing to attempt to resolve their dispute through an alternative dispute resolution process prior to the timely filing of an appeal, however, the time limit for filing the appeal is extended by an additional 30 days--for a total of 60 days. A response to an appeal must be filed within 20 days of the date of the Board's acknowledgment order. The time for filing a submission under this section is computed in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.23 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit. No time limit applies to appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Pub. L. 103-353), <span class="Italic">as amended</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> part 1208 of this title. <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1208 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to appeals under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Pub. L. 105-339). <span class="Italic">See</span> part 1209 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to whistleblower appeals and stay requests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Example A: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Example B: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Example C: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c) Timeliness of appeals. If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d) Method of filing an appeal. Filing of an appeal must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under &#x00A7; 1201.14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(e) Filing a response. Filing of a response must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under &#x00A7; 1201.14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The date of filing is established by 5 CFR 1201.4(l), (m), (n) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(l)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Date of filing</span>. A document that is filed with a Board office by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which the Board office receives it. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the submission is presumed to have been mailed five days (excluding days on which the Board is closed for business) before its receipt.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters subject to electronic filing</span>. Subject to the registration requirement of paragraph (e) of this section, parties and representatives may use electronic filing (e-filing) to do any of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;File any pleading, including a new appeal, in any matter within the MSPB's appellate jurisdiction (&#x00A7; 1201.3);</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_865"></span>(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters excluded from electronic filing</span>. Electronic filing may not be used to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;File a request to hear a case as a class appeal or any opposition thereto (Sec. 1201.27);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Serve a subpoena (Sec. 1201.83);</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Internet is sole venue for electronic filing</span>. Following the instructions at e-appeal Online, the MSPB's e-Appeal site (<a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov</a>), is the only method allowed for filing electronic pleadings with the MSPB. The MSPB will not accept pleadings filed by electronic mail (e-mail).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Registration as an e-filer</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Registration as an e-filer constitutes consent to accept electronic service of pleadings filed by other registered e-filers and documents issued by the MSPB. Except when filing a new appeal within the MSPB's appellate jurisdiction (&#x00A7; 1201.3), no party or representative may file an electronic pleading with the MSPB unless he or she has registered with the MSPB as an e-filer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;With the exception of a designation of a representative by a party who is an individual, the exclusive means for a party or representative to register as an e-filer during an MSPB proceeding is to follow the instructions at e-appeal Online (<a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov</a>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;When a party who is an individual is represented, the party and the representative can make separate determinations whether to register as an e-filer. For example, an appellant may file and receive pleadings and MSPB documents by non-electronic means, even though his or her representative has registered as an e-filer. When a party has more than one representative, however, all representatives must choose the same method of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A party or representative may withdraw his or her registration as an e-filer. Such withdrawal means that, effective upon the MSPB's receipt of this withdrawal, pleadings and MSPB documents will no longer be served on that person in electronic form. A withdrawal of registration as an e-filer may be filed at e-Appeal Online, in which case service is governed by paragraph (j) of this section, or by non-electronic means, in which case service is governed by &#x00A7; 1201.26(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Registration as an e-filer applies only to a single MSPB appeal or proceeding. If an appeal is dismissed without prejudice, however, and is later refiled, an election of e-filing status will remain in effect. An election of e-filing status will also remain in effect for purposes of filing a petition for enforcement under Subpart F of this part, or filing a motion for an attorney fee award or compensatory or consequential damages under Subpart H of this Part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Each e-filer must notify the MSPB and other participants of any change in his or her e-mail address. When done via e-Appeal Online, such notification is done by selecting the "Pleading" option.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">e-Filing not mandatory for e-filers.</span> A party or representative who has registered as an e-filer may file any pleading by non-electronic means, i.e., via postal mail, fax, or personal or commercial delivery.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Form of electronic pleadings</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Options for e-filing</span>. An appellant or representative using e-Appeal Online to file a new appeal within the MSPB's appellate jurisdiction (&#x00A7; 1201.3) must complete the structured interview at that site (<a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov</a>). For all other pleadings, the e-filer has the option of uploading an electronic file or entering the text of the pleading online. Regardless of the means of filing a particular pleading, the e-filer will be allowed to submit supporting documentation such as attachments, in either electronic or paper form, as described in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (h) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Electronic formats allowed</span>. The MSPB will accept numerous electronic formats, including word-processing and spreadsheet formats, Portable Document Format (PDF), and image files (files created by scanning). A list of formats allowed can be found at e-Appeal Online. All electronic documents must be formatted so that they will print on standard 8 1/2 inch by 11 inch paper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Requirements for pleadings with 3 or more electronic attachments</span>. An e-filer who uploads 3 or more supporting documents, in addition to the document that constitutes the primary pleading, must identify each attachment, either by filling out the table for such attachments at e-Appeal Online, or by uploading the supporting documents in the form of one or more PDF files in which each attachment is bookmarked. Each attachment must be designated with a brief descriptive label, which will include exhibit numbers or letters where appropriate or required, e.g., "Exh. 4b, Decision Notice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hybrid pleadings that include both electronic and paper documents</span>. An e-filer may file a hybrid pleading in which part of the pleading is submitted electronically, and part of the pleading consists of one or more paper documents filed by non-electronic means. All components of a hybrid pleading are subject to applicable time limits. If one or more parts of a hybrid pleading are untimely filed, the judge or the Clerk may reject the untimely part or parts while accepting timely filed parts of the same pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Repository at e-Appeal Online.</span> All notices, orders, decisions, and other documents issued by the MSPB, as well as all pleadings filed via e-Appeal Online, will be made available to parties and their representatives for viewing and downloading at the Repository at e-Appeal Online. In addition, most pleadings filed at the petition for review stage of adjudication, and some pleadings filed at the regional office level, will be available at the Repository. Also available at the Repository will be an electronic "docket sheet" listing all documents issued by the MSPB to the parties, as well as all pleadings filed by the parties, including those pleadings that are not available for viewing and downloading in electronic form. Access to appeal documents at the Repository will be limited to the parties and representatives of the appeals in which they were filed.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(j)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Service of electronic pleadings and MSPB documents</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When MSPB documents are issued, e-mail messages will be sent to e-filers that notify them of the issuance and that contain links to the Repository where the documents can be viewed and downloaded. Paper copies of these documents will not ordinarily be served on e-filers. Pleadings submitted via e-Appeal Online will be available to parties and representatives at the e-Appeal Online Repository, and the MSPB will send e-mail messages to other e-filers notifying them of each pleading, with a link to the Repository. When using e-Appeal Online to file a pleading, e-filers will be notified of all documents that must be served by non-electronic means, and they must certify that they will serve all such documents no later than the first business day after the electronic submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Delivery of e-mail can encounter a number of failure points. If the MSPB is advised of non-delivery, it will attempt to redeliver and, if that is unsuccessful, will deliver by postal mail or other means. E-filers are responsible for ensuring that e-mail from <a href="mailto:@mspb.gov">@mspb.gov</a> is not blocked by filters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;E-filers are responsible for monitoring case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that they have received all case-related documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(k)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Documents requiring a signature</span>. Electronic documents filed by a party who has registered as an e-filer pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be signed for purposes of any regulation in part 1201, 1203, 1208, or 1209 of this chapter that requires a signature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(l)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Affidavits and declarations made under penalty of perjury</span>. Registered e-filers may submit electronic pleadings in the form of declarations made under penalty of perjury under 28 U.S.C. 1746, as described in Appendix IV to this part. If the declarant is someone other than the e-filer, a physically signed affidavit or declaration should be uploaded as an image file, or submitted separately as a non-electronic document under paragraph (h) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(m)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Date electronic documents are filed and served</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;As provided in &#x00A7; 1201.4(l) of this part, the date of filing for pleadings filed via e-Appeal Online is the date of electronic submission. All pleadings filed via e-Appeal Online are time stamped with Eastern Time, but the timeliness of a pleading will be determined based on the time zone from which the pleading was submitted. For example, a pleading filed at 11 <small>P.M.</small> Pacific Time on August 20 will be stamped by e-Appeal Online as being filed at 2 <small>A.M.</small> Eastern Time on August 21. However, if the pleading was required to be filed with the Washington Regional Office (in the Eastern Time Zone) on August 20, it would be considered timely, as it was submitted prior to midnight Pacific Time on August 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;MSPB documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;In the event that the MSPB or any party encounters difficulties filing, serving, or receiving electronic documents, the judge or the Clerk of the Board may order one or more parties to cease filing pleadings by e-filing, cease serving documents in electronic form, or take both these actions. In such instances, filing and service shall be undertaken in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.26. The authority to order the cessation of the use of electronic filing may be for a particular submission, for a particular time frame, or for the duration of the pendency of a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(n)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority of a judge or the Clerk to regulate e-filing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_866"></span>(2)&#x2003;A judge or the Clerk of the Board may require that any document filed electronically be submitted in non-electronic form and bear the written signature of the submitter. A party receiving such an order from a judge or the Clerk of the Board shall, within 5 calendar days, serve on the judge or Clerk of the Board by postal mail, by fax, or by commercial or personal delivery a signed, non-electronic copy of the document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(o)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">MSPB reserves the right to revert to traditional methods of service</span>. The MSPB may serve documents via traditional means--postal mail, fax, personal or commercial delivery--at its discretion. Parties and their representatives are responsible for ensuring that the MSPB always has their current postal mailing addresses, even when they have registered as e-filers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For information on the Board's electronic filing system, refer to the Board's issuance: Information Sheet No. 8: e-Appeals: <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/e-Appeal.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/e-Appeal.pdf</a>.

<p class="Body-Text">E-filing is through the Board's website, <a href="http://www.mspb.gov/">www.mspb.gov</a> and <a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov/</a>. It is distinct from email. "The Board does not accept pleadings filed by electronic mail. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(d)." <span class="Italic">Herrera-Diaz v. OPM</span>, NY-0831-14-0211-I-1 (NP 8/5/2014) ("Moreover, the e-Appeal generated email containing the order on timeliness explicitly advised that the appellant should not reply to that email account. ('Do not reply to this email account for submitting additional case data. All electronic submissions must be made via the e-Appeal website.')."). Board adjudication is based on a record, and the record is developed through submission filed in accordance with Board regulations. The record is not developed through emails to the AJ, to the Board's Clerk, or to other Board employees. AJs may occasionally communicate with the parties or counsel by email, but those communications, often on scheduling or relating to settlement status, are not a part of the adjudication record. E-filers may file documents through the mail, fax, personal, or commercial delivery, and that may be the most practical means for large documents if scanning is impractical. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. Dept. of Labor,</span> CB-7121-15-0010-V-1 n.3 (NP 5/22/2015) ("the Board's electronic filing regulations do not require the e-filing of any pleading, even for those who register as e-filers. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(f)").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In olden times, ere electronic filing did begin, life was simple. A document arrived from opposing counsel or from the Board, delivered through the good offices of the Postal Service, a commercial carrier, "by hand," or through lowly fax. You looked at it, calendared a response date, filed the necessary rejoinder, and life went on. Of importance, a piece of paper had arrived, its importance was recognized and the document was dealt with. It was hard to ignore--it had to be read, moved around, piled up, perhaps filed. With e-filing, an email arrives to tell you that a document is available for review through your computer. Perhaps you can link to the document through the email link and, depending on the state of the art of your equipment, software, and Internet connections and protections, you may have to go the MSPB website and access the document through the "repository" after entering into and validating your existence on the Board's e-filing system. The original notification email may appear in your main email inbox, or it might show up in junk mail or deleted mail. Wherever it appears, it may be one of fourscore or more emails arriving that day. If you are out of the office, on vacation, or in a hospital room, the email arrives and you are served on the date the electronic filing is posted. You need to do more than look at your desk to see what the postal person brought that day. You must actively engage your email system and then follow the notifications to retrieve, docket, somehow file, and then respond to whatever was placed on the system in your Board case. You must engage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">E-filers must aggressively monitor the Board's e-appeal "repository." The regulation speaks of e-filers being "responsible for monitoring case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that they have received all case-related documents." The Board cautioned in <span class="Italic">Rivera v. SSA</span>, 111 MSPR 581, 584 &#x00B6; 5, 2009 MSPB 127 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision clearly indicated that the appellant's petition for review had to be filed by February 16, 2009. Because February 16, 2009, was a federal holiday, the appellant actually had until February 17, 2009, in which to timely file his petition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23. We reject the appellant's assertion that he did not receive the initial decision until February 20, 2009. Our e-filer regulations provide that, as a registered e-filer, the appellant agreed to accept documents through electronic service and, further, that he was required to monitor his case activity at the Repository at e-Appeal Online to ensure that he received all case related documents. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e), (j)(3). Moreover, our regulations provide that pleadings and Board documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2). When a statute or regulation "deems" something to have been done, the event is considered to have occurred whether or not it actually did. <span class="Italic">See Lima v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). Thus, we deem the appellant to have received the initial decision on January 12, 2009, and his petition was, therefore, filed 5 days untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a pleader's email address changes, the change must be made on the "Pleading" option in the e-appeal system. Changing "My Account" is insufficient to alter the email address for a pending case. <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-4324-13-0386-B-1 (NP 2/3/2015) (dismissing an appeal when the appellant did not respond to orders from the AJ, asserted his email address changed, did not properly enter the change on the e-filing system, and he should have known from information that the Board presumed he received that his case was continued, on remand, through a new docket number; in what seemed a harsh result, the Board discounted the appellant's statements that he attempted to inform the region and the AJ of the change in the email address).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is quick to default e-filers who miss deadlines because of their lack of competence with computers and email systems.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Charney v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-0752-15-0388-I-1 (NP 7/31/2015) ("the appellant or his representative could have opted out of e-filer registration at any time if either was confused about the system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(4)."); <span class="Italic">Rausch v. VA</span>, CH-752S-12-0607-I-1 (NP 7/19/2013) ("The Board is not responsible for the fact that the documents in question ended up in the appellant's junk mail folder; the appellant is responsible for diligently monitoring the progress of his appeal and ensuring he is in receipt of his mail, in whatever form he has opted to receive it."); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. DOD,</span> DC-1221-10-0363-W-1 (NP 2/15/2012) ("As previously noted, he asserts that one of the re-submitted documents, the Master Case File, was not properly uploaded into the system below, and, therefore, the administrative judge did not have a chance to view it. The Board's e-Appeal system maintains a Repository that includes 'all pleadings filed via e-Appeal Online,' 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(i), and it is reasonable to expect e-filers to check the Repository to ensure that their documents have been added to the system, as they are in the best position to know what they submitted. Thus, the appellant similarly has not shown that the Board should consider the Master Case File, or the arguments based upon it, on review."); <span class="Italic">Hsu v. NASA</span>, DC-0752-11-0500-I-1 (NP 10/28/2011) ("To the extent that the appellant further asserts that he did not receive the administrative judge's order to submit evidence and argument on the jurisdictional issue, we note that the appellant is a registered e-filer, and we find that he received the order on the date of electronic submission regardless of his failure to notice it."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Takeuchi v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant has not shown that his appeal was improperly processed because an electronic pleading related to the motion to dismiss his appeal ended up in his e-mail's spam folder, where it remained for three months before he discovered the pleading. The record shows that in issuing pleadings, both the administrative judge and the agency used the e-mail address furnished by the appellant. Having filed all pleadings in accordance with the information furnished by the appellant, neither the Board nor the agency bear any responsibility for the fact that a pleading ended up in the appellant's spam folder. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">D'Aquin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 499, 503 (1994) (service on an appellant at the last address of record is proper); <span class="Italic">Stewart v.

In addition, neither the Board nor the agency is responsible for the pleading languishing in the appellant's spam folder for three months before he discovered it. The appellant is responsible for diligently monitoring the progress of his appeal and ensuring he is in receipt of his mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...As an e-filer, the appellant was required to ensure that emails from the Board were not blocked by filters and to monitor her case to ensure she received all related documents. <span class="Italic">See Rivera v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 581, &#x00B6; 5 (2009); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(2), (3). If the Board is advised of non-delivery of electronic pleadings, it will attempt to redeliver and, if that is unsuccessful, will deliver by postal mail or other means. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(2). Although the appellant asserts that she contacted the Northeastern Regional Office and the Washington Regional Office while her appeal was pending, there is no indication in the record nor does the appellant allege that during those conversations she requested assistance with the e-Appeal system or otherwise informed the regional offices of her specific problem viewing the acknowledgment order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The responsibility for monitoring the Board's e-appeal repository exists even <span id="Page_867"></span>though only the attorney is an e-filer and the appellant receives filings by mail. <span class="Italic">Morton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record here confirms that a copy of every order, including the initial decision, was sent electronically to the e-mail address that Ms. Pensanti provided in the initial appeal paperwork. Although the appellant was not an e-filer, the record also reflects that he received a copy of every order via regular mail. Consistent with this precedent, we deem Ms. Pensanti (and thus, the appellant) to have received the initial decision on August 31, 2009, and we conclude that the PFR was filed 14 days late. <span class="Italic">See Lima,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 ("Thus, as a matter of law, the appellant's representative was served with the initial decision on August 31, 2005.

OPM</span>, 851 F.3d 1309, 1316-17 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board rejected Ms. Boyd's argument on the ground that her failure to file a prehearing submission or to request a hearing was attributable to her lack of diligence. <span class="Italic">See Rocha v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 688 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (stating that, under good cause standard, the Board "acted well within its discretion" in refusing to allow untimely filing when the petitioner did not "carry his burden to establish that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence in monitoring his case.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only explanation Ms. Boyd provides for her failure to submit evidence to the administrative judge or to respond to the administrative judge's show-cause order by requesting a hearing is that her fianc&#x00E9; deleted all the emails sent by the Board from the email account she chose to use for e-filing. That explanation, however, does not justify her failure, given her choice to register as an efiler.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board noted, Ms. Boyd chose to receive Board communications exclusively by email. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(1) ("Registration as an e-filer constitutes consent to accept electronic service of...documents issued by the [Board]."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 1201.14(j)(2) (providing that the Board will serve by non-electronic means only when advised of non-delivery of e-mail, followed by a second failed attempt).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects counsel and parties to follow the e-filing instructions and admonitions, to seek assistance from MSPB (the AJ or someone in the regional office, or the Office of the Board Clerk, or the technical help desk identified in the e-filing system) if necessary, and when the e-filing system does not seem to do what it is supposed to do, to use alternate means of filing the appeal, such as fax or mail. In considerable detail the Board reviewed its e-filing process when it declared an appeal untimely in <span class="Italic">Faden v. VA</span>, NY-0752-12-0231-I-1 (NP 7/2/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her position as a Recreation Therapist effective April 27, 2012. The agency's decision notice correctly advised the appellant that she could appeal the removal action to the Board and that the 30-calendar-day period for filing a timely appeal would begin on the day after the effective date of the removal. The decision notice also warned the appellant that the Board would dismiss an untimely filed appeal unless a good reason for the delay is shown. Because the 30th calendar day following April 27 was Sunday, May 27 and Monday, May 28 was a federal holiday, the deadline for timely filing was Tuesday, May 29, 2012. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23. The appeal was filed via the Board's electronic filing system, e-Appeal Online, on June 5, 2012, 7 days after the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued two orders relating to the timeliness of the appeal. As recounted in more detail in the initial decision, the appellant and her representative gave the following reasons for the late filing. The appellant and her attorney met at his office on May 23, 2012, and filled out a copy of the Board's appeal form, MSPB Form 185. They scanned that appeal form so that it became an electronic file but discovered that this electronic file could not be filed electronically and instead typed the same information into the e-Appeal Online application. Both the appellant and her attorney stated that they believed the appeal was successfully filed on May 23. On May 24, 25, and 26, however, the attorney received automated emails from e-Appeal Online, each of which was entitled "Reminder: Unsubmitted Appeal." The first paragraph of each of these emails stated: "You have drafted an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board at <a href="https://e-appeal.mspb.gov">https://e-appeal.mspb.gov</a>. Your appeal has not yet been submitted." Each email provided instructions for completing and submitting the appeal and stated that no more emails would be sent after the third. Notwithstanding these email messages, the attorney stated that he still believed that he had successfully filed an appeal but that there was a problem with attachments that had been requested which he had been unable to upload on May 23. The attorney stated that he attempted to complete the process on May 25, but the e-Appeal Online system was down or unavailable. The appellant stated that she attempted to access e-Appeal Online on May 28 but could not do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 29, there was an email exchange between the appellant and her attorney in which she advised him that the e-Appeal Online "website must have been 'down.' It's fine, now." Further, "[she] noticed that [the attorney] did not file a pleading." The attorney replied by email with the following advice: "Submit it by mail then."The appellant stated that she "typed the entire appeal all over again" on May 29, but she did not submit it because she was "afraid of doing so" without Mr. Giordano first seeing it, and she finally took this action several days late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the appeal as untimely filed, the administrative judge concluded that neither the appellant nor her attorney exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. She further found that the appellant did not meet the criterion for excusing an untimely filing by proving that her diligent efforts to prosecute an appeal were thwarted, without her knowledge, by her attorney's deceptions and negligence. The judge noted in this regard that, on May 29, the last day for timely filing, the attorney advised the appellant to file the appeal by mail that day, but the appellant delayed for 7 days before she did so. Finally, the judge found that the appellant failed to establish that she was prevented by disease or injury from timely filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's attorney could not reasonably have believed that he had successfully filed the appeal via e-Appeal Online.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the MSPB's e-Appeal Online software generated three email messages to the appellant's attorney, each of which told him in so many words that the online appeal he had started on May 23 had not been submitted. We further note that, early in the online process for filing a new appeal, every user is presented with a screen that states, "Your appeal is not submitted until you receive a confirmation with a submitted date and time like the one shown here:...." This statement is followed by a sample email message the top line of which is "<span class="Italic">Confirmation of On-line Appeal Submission</span>," followed by the name of the appellant, the user name under which the appeal was submitted, the Appeal Number, the Submission Date and Time, a Confirmation Number, and the identity of the Board office that received the submission. In the face of this online message and the three unequivocal email messages on May 24, 25, and 26, Mr. Giordano could not reasonably have believed thereafter that he had successfully filed an appeal on the appellant's behalf on May 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Although e-Appeal Online was unavailable during part of the period in question, this did not prevent timely filing.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that she was denied a hearing on the issue of whether the MSPB online filing system was having problems during the period in question (May 23 through June 5, 2012). As noted above, the appellant and her attorney complained that the Board's e-filing system was inaccessible at various points of time, but the initial decision did not address this contention. We therefore do so now. Our technical staff has advised that the e-filing system was non-functional during two periods of time relevant to this appeal: on May 24 from 8:18 <small>A.M.</small> to 8:38 <small>A.M.</small> (20 minutes); and from 4:00 <small>P.M.</small> on May 27 until 4:30 <small>A.M</small>. on May 29. The very brief down-time on May 24 could not have adversely affected the appellant or her attorney. The down-time on May 28 could have affected the appellant, as she stated that she attempted to access the e-Appeal Online website that day. On May 29, the final date for timely filing, the system was functioning properly after 4:30 <small>A.M.</small>, including the period when the appellant and her attorney exchanged emails. Indeed, the appellant advised her attorney that morning that the MSPB e-filing website is "fine now."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_868"></span>In sum, there was nothing to prevent the appellant from successfully filing her appeal via e-Appeal Online on May 23, May 24, May 25, or May 26, or at any time after 4:30 <small>A.M.</small> on May 29. We note that appeals were successfully filed with the Board via e-Appeal Online on each of those dates. We also note that nothing prevented the appellant or her attorney from mailing or faxing an appeal on any day during the period from May 23 through May 29; nor was there anything preventing the appellant or her attorney from requesting help with the e-filing system during this period of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Subsections (m) and (n) of the Board's e-filing regulation do not provide a basis for finding good cause for the untimely filing.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant cites paragraph (n)(1) of the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14 to support her claim of good cause for the untimely filing of her appeal. That portion of the regulation provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event that the MSPB or any party encounters difficulties filing, serving, or receiving electronic documents, the judge or the Clerk of the Board may order one or more parties to cease filing pleadings by e-filing, cease serving documents in electronic form, or take both these actions. In such instances, filing and service shall be undertaken in accordance with &#x00A7; 1201.26. The authority to order the cessation of the use of electronic filing may be for a particular submission, for a particular time frame, or for the duration of the pendency of a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The obvious purpose of this regulation is to deal with problems experienced <span class="Italic">after</span> a party has become an e-filer in a particular appeal. During the period from May 23 until June 5, the appellant was not an e-filer with respect to her removal; indeed, there was no Board appeal of the removal action until that date. And as noted above, there was no basis for an MSPB employee to assist the appellant or her attorney with any problems they might be having with the Board's e-filing system because neither contacted the MSPB to report having such problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also cites subsection 1201.14(m)(2), which provides that "MSPB documents served on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of the electronic submission," and argues that the appeal should be deemed to have been filed on May 23, when she and her attorney thought the appeal had been filed. The problem with this contention is that, as just discussed, she was not a registered e-filer and there was no removal appeal until June 5, 2012. And as discussed above, neither she nor her attorney could reasonably believe that the appeal was filed before that date.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Faden</span> elevates form over substance. The appellant and her counsel clearly intended to appeal, made that effort, albeit imperfectly executed, well within the deadline for filing the appeal, met with some confusion or poor communications along the way, and perfected the appeal a week late. There was no prejudice to the agency. The deadline for an adverse action appeal is regulatory, not statutory. There was no good reason for the Board to have refused to waive its timeliness regulation. The only purpose served was Board docket control. One appeal dismissed as untimely is one less appeal to adjudicate. To avoid bad results when there are problems with the electronic filing system, file materials through alternate means, and by all means, call the Board's Clerk, 202-653-7200, and let them know what the problem is; if you cannot reach the Clerk's office, call the Board's regional office where the appeal is pending and speak to the staff there. Keep a record of your curative efforts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an e-filer desire to revert to mail service, the change must formally be made known to the Board, as was explained in <span class="Italic">Fris v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-10-0070-I-1 (NP 2/23/2011), involving the timeliness of a PFR that, in turn, depended on the timing of the receipt of an initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant filed her petition for review on July 13, 2010, which was two months after the May 13, 2010 filing deadline, and she asserts that she had just become aware of the initial decision. Specifically, the appellant states on review that she "had requested that all corresponden[ce] be delivered via United States Postal Service mail, but both [the administrative judge and the agency representative] continued the proceedings via email corresponden[ce]." She asserts that she "made this request because [she] was without a computer. When [she] was able to regain computer access, [she] discovered that a decision had been issued[.] "</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the appellant elected to register as an e-filer. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2), Board documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission. When a statute or regulation "deems" something to have been done, including e-filing, the event is considered to have occurred whether or not it actually did. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Social Security Administration</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 581, &#x00B6; 5 (2009). Thus, the appellant is deemed to have received the initial decision on its date of issuance, April 8, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An e-filer may withdraw her registration as an e-filer at any time during a Board proceeding, but such withdrawal must be done by written pleading submitted either via e&#8209;Appeal Online or via non&#8209;electronic means. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e)(4). Although the appellant asserts that she "had requested" that all Board correspondence be delivered by the U.S. Postal Service, there is no evidence in the record that she ever expressed a desire to change her e-filing status. Further, the agency asserts in its response to the petition for review that the appellant elected to be an e-filer and that it never received notification that the appellant wished to change her filing status.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once an e-filer may not make one always an e-filer. The Board did not accept an argument in <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 106 MSPR 210, 215 &#x00B6; 11, 2007 MSPB 168 (2007), that the appellant, having registered as an e-filer in an earlier appeal was entitled to assume that he continued to be an e-filer in a subsequent appeal. In the later appeal, the AJ sent out an acknowledgment order by mail, although the appellant also asserted he was having difficulty receiving his mail. The Board noted that "[h]aving received those orders in hard copy only, the appellant could not have reasonably maintained his assumption that he would receive notices regarding this appeal electronically." A representative may be registered as an e-filer, but each appeal is dealt with separately and the representative and client must denominate their e-filing status in each appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An e-filing is effective when it is transmitted, and the date of the filing is the date of the electronic submission even if it is not made during normal business hours. If the recipient is not registered as an e-filer, the e-filer must certify that she will serve all documents that must be served by nonelectronic means no later than the first business day after the electronic transmission. <span class="Italic">Gryder v.

Timeliness of electronic submissions is judged by the time zone where the pleading is filed. <span class="Italic">Swartz v. MSPB</span>, 319 Fed. Appx. 894, 896 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (citing &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an e-filed appeal or other pleading is late because of what appears to be a problem with the MSPB's server and network system--an occurrence of some frequency and at times prolonged--the delay is likely to be excused if it is explained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Livingston v. OPM</span>, 105 MSPR 314, 318 &#x00B6; 9, 2007 MSPB 84 (2007) ("We further find, under the particular circumstances of this case, that the appellant has shown good cause for filing his petition for review beyond the deadline because he attempted to make a timely electronic filing, he was able to exit the Board's website without receiving a clear warning that he had not yet filed his pleading, and he acted with due diligence in submitting the relevant documents when he became aware of the problem."); <span class="Italic">Boykin v. USPS</span>, 104 MSPR 460, 461-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7, 2007 MSPB 5 (2007) (appellant's representative attempted an e-filing on the last day for an appeal, received an error message, and filed the next day; the Board noted that problems had been reported with its system on the day the filing was first attempted); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Takeuchi v.

To the extent Mr. Takeuchi suggests he had difficulties accessing his e-filing system account, he did not indicate any efforts to resolve that issue."). The Board keeps records of system outages. Those records are available through a FOIA request or, should the impact of a system outage be at issue, the Board may itself decide to have the records examined and the results explained in a decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board establishes a presumption that pleadings served by e-filing are received, <span class="Italic">Muehl v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-10-0662-I-1 (NP 3/15/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that he did not receive the administrative judge's jurisdictional orders. The appellant elected to register as an e-filer, which required his consent to accept service of all documents issued by the Board in electronic form. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(e). The certificates of service for the administrative judge's two jurisdictional orders certified that these orders were electronically mailed to the appellant on May 14, 2010, and June 15, 2010, respectively. Board documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m)(2). When a regulation "deems" something to be done, the event is considered to have occurred, whether or not it actually did. <span class="Italic">Vandagriff v. Department of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Thus, as a matter of law, the appellant was served with both jurisdictional orders.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To suggest a legal presumption of receipt of e-filings is not quite the same as saying that the presumption cannot be rebutted through evidence that the e-filing system did not work properly. <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. USPS</span>, 105 MSPR 297, 298-301 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2007 MSPB 83 (2007), analyzed problems relating to e-filing and the Board's approach to those technical difficulties when an agency raised a timeliness objection concerning an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On May 7, 2006, the appellant created a new appeal on the e-filing section of the Board's website and supplied all of the information required on the appeal form. At some point, the appellant printed the <span id="Page_869"></span>appeal form, and the words "DRAFT--NOT SUBMITTED" appear across the bottom of each page next to "Appeal Number 200601296." The appellant opted to submit attachments to his appeal, such as the agency's decision letter, in hard copy. He mailed the "DRAFT" petition for appeal form and the attachments on May 18, 2006, 10 days beyond the deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an acknowledgment order informing the appellant that his appeal appeared to be untimely. In the acknowledgment order, the administrative judge advised the appellant that he bore the burden of proof on timeliness and ordered him to file evidence and argument showing that the appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. The agency filed a "Motion to Dismiss for Untimeliness." The appellant did not respond to either the acknowledgment order or the agency's motion. Approximately 26 days after the agency filed its motion, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed with no good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed a petition for review in which he explains his activity on May 7, 2006, and asserts that he filed a timely appeal on that day. He argues in the alternative that, if the Board deems the appeal to have been filed late, he has shown good cause for his delay because he believed that he had made a timely filing. The agency has filed a response opposing the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a petition for appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). The date of filing by e-filing is the date of electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l). The appellant bears the burden of proof with regard to timeliness, which he must establish by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Peterson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 237, 242 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 976 F.2d 747 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)] . Here, the appellant avers that he e-filed his appeal on May 7, 2006, at approximately 12:41 <small>A.M.</small> A review of the Board's e-appeal Event Log shows that, on the day before his appeal was due, the appellant created a new appeal on the e-filing section of the Board's web site. The Board's e-appeal Event Log shows, however, that the appellant did not "file" his appeal on time because he did not complete the "electronic submission." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will waive its filing deadline only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the particular circumstances of this case, the appellant's lateness should be excused because he has shown that he reasonably believed that he had filed his appeal on May 7, 2006. On that day, the appellant answered all of the required questions on the electronic appeal form and received an "Appeal Number" that created an impression that he had filed an e-appeal. Furthermore, a review of the Board's e-filing process shows that the appellant would have been required to "validate" his appeal before he could print it in the form that he did. Such "validation" would have furthered the impression in this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's mind that he had filed an appeal. Although the printed version of the appeal form says "DRAFT--NOT SUBMITTED" at the bottom of each page, the facts that he had received an e-appeal number and had "validated" his appeal could have indicated to the appellant that he had filed an appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant likely received the following message before exiting the e-appeal site:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have chosen to save your uncompleted e-appeal. Although we will save it for you electronically for as long as 90 days, you should be aware that most appeals must be filed no later than 30 calendar days after the effective date of the action being appealed, or 30 calendar days after the date you receive the agency's decision, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this message states that the appeal was "uncompleted," it did not clearly say that it had not yet been filed. Because the appellant had chosen to submit attachments to his appeal in hard copy, he reasonably could have believed that "completion" required submission of the attachments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, although the appellant did not actually file his appeal on May 7, 2006, within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(<span class="Italic">l</span>), he reasonably believed that he did. The appellant filled out an appeal form on the Board's e-filing site prior to the filing deadline, he received an "Appeal Number," and he was able to exit the website without receiving clear warning that his appeal had not been filed. Further, he acted with due diligence in submitting the appeal form and the attachments on May 18, 2006, rather than waiting to receive additional evidence related to a grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not submit to the administrative judge the evidence or argument that he now presents on review, the Board will excuse his failure to do so. The acknowledgment order did not inform the appellant of the date on which the administrative judge considered the appeal to have been filed or the fact that the administrative judge considered the appeal to have been filed by United States mail and not electronically. The administrative judge should have provided this information in the acknowledgment order. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 144, 148 (1997). Further, the agency's motion made no reference to an e-appeal. Yet, the above discussion shows that one of the main timeliness issues is whether the appellant's May 7, 2006 activities on the Board's e-appeal site constituted a "filing" under the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(<span class="Italic">l</span>). Because the appellant was not put on notice of the relevant timeliness issue in his case, we have considered the evidence and argument he presents for the first time on review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lamb v. OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 415, 2009 MSPB 9 (2009) (remanding an appeal for adjudication after the AJ dismissed it as untimely and the appellant demonstrated reasonable (but unsuccessful) compliance with the Board's e-filing system).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For those whose efforts to use the e-filing system are marred with technical difficulties, on request to MSPB, its IT technicians should be able to produce a report of the state of the system at a particular time, including access, or possibly attempted access, by a filer. What of other proof? A few illustrative decisions from the federal courts, and a couple commentators, offer suggestions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From the Eighth Circuit, <span class="Italic">American Boat Co., Inc. v. Unknown Sunken Barge</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051328418f3d91011232">418 F.3d 910</a>, 914-15 (8th Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court then considered American Boat's evidence of non-delivery. It stated that American Boat had submitted: (1) the affidavits of three attorneys stating that they had neither received notice via U.S. Mail nor e-mail, (2) an affidavit of Greable, stating that she had not received notice (3) a printout of Greable's Inbox, which showed she had received 13 other e-mail notifications from the district court between October 31, 2003 and November 21, 2003, but did not show the e-mail notification at issue. The district court assessed this evidence and concluded that American Boat failed to overcome the presumption that the docket accurately reflected delivery of the November 5, 2003 e-mail notification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the district court that a presumption of delivery should apply to e-mails. "A jury is permitted to infer that information sent via a reliable means--such as the postal service or a telegram--was received." <span class="Italic">Kennell v. Gates</span>, 215 F.3d 825, 829 (8th Cir. 2000). We have held that there is "no principled reason why a jury would not be able to make the same inference regarding other forms of communication--such as facsimiles, electronic mail, and in-house computer message systems--provided they are accepted as generally reliable and that the particular message was properly dispatched." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, in this case, we conclude that the appellants have made a sufficient showing to at least be entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether they have adequately rebutted the presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making this determination, we note several factors. First, the system had only been in operation for a few weeks. We have no doubt that the district clerk's office had thoroughly tested the system. However, any new computer system is subject to a certain number of "glitches." Secondly, the fact that the system was not operating as intended is evidenced by the fact that it appears undisputed that none of the attorneys who were to receive paper notice received a copy of the court's order. Finally, the government's co-counsel in Washington indicated that she had no record of having received e-mail notification, although, she had also registered to receive notification in that format. Although the district court was correct that the affidavit of the computer technician, filed as a part of the motion for reconsideration, should have been filed sooner, it does lend further support to our concerns about whether notice was actually sent and received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[A]s a practical matter it is never easy to prove a negative" <span class="Italic">Elkins v. United States</span>, 364 U.S. 206, 218, 80 S. Ct. 1437, 4 L. Ed.2d 1669 (1960). In cases involving lack of notice, there is often little a party can do except swear he or she did not receive the communication. Here, where several intended recipients, most of whom are officers of the court, all said they did not receive notice, there is enough evidence to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the rebuttal of the presumption of delivery and receipt.</p>

Boat Co. v. Unknown Sunken Barge</span>, 418 F.3d 910, 914 (8th Cir.2005) (holding that a presumption of delivery applies to reliable forms of electronic communication).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Only Appellant's counsel was in a position to protect Appellant from precisely what occurred here; neither the district court nor Appellees had reason to know that Appellant had not received notice of the motion, especially since nothing in the CM/ECF system indicated that Appellant failed to receive the filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> W.D.N.C. R. 5.3(A) (recognizing that "[i]ssuance of the...NEF...constitutes proof of service of the filed document upon all registered users"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> J.A. 179, 185 (noting that "La] NEF generated by the Court's ECF system indicates that notice of each of these documents was electronically mailed to Plaintiffs counsel on August 8, 2008," and finding that there is a "lack of any evidence of an error in the docketing of the Defendants' Motion in the Court's ECF system"). Knowing that dispositive motions were due on August 8, 2008, Appellant's counsel had good reason, after realizing he was experiencing computer problems, to check the court's docket after such date or contact the court and opposing counsel to notify them of his computer troubles. Had Appellant's counsel done either of these two things, he would have discovered the motion for summary judgment before judgment was entered. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Am, Airlines</span>, 389 F.3d.1291, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (affirming the district court's decision not to grant a Rule 59(e) motion since "the dismissal of the [] suit might have been avoided through the exercise of due diligence"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> J.A. 184-85 ("Had counsel done either of these things at any point in the nearly four months between the time that the Motion for Summary Judgment was filed and the Court entered its Order, counsel would have learned that a dispositive motion had been filed, and he could have taken steps to respond to the motion in a proper fashion."). Instead, Appellant's counsel strategically chose not to call opposing counsel after the deadline for filing dispositive motions had passed because he did not want to alert them to the court's deadline. More amazingly, he chose not to check with the district court either. In other words, Appellant's counsel made the affirmative decision to remain in the dark.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant elects to use electronic filings, the AJ should use that process and not circumvent it to the appellant's procedural disadvantage. The Board reversed a procedural dismissal in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GORDON_WAYNE_A_AT_0752_06_0458_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248550.pdf">104 MSPR 358</a>, 361 &#x00B6; 5, 2006 MSPB 358 (2006), because the appellant elected to follow e-filing procedures and may have missed procedural notices that were subsequently mailed (rather than transmitted as attachments to email) to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the appellant's representative filed the initial appeal electronically, selected e-filer status, and included his e-mail address in the submission. The Board's electronic filing regulations provide, "The Board's notices, orders, and decisions will be served on e-filers as PDF files attached to electronic mail messages, which will be sent to the electronic mail address supplied by the e-filer." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(k). However, as reflected on each certificate of service, the regional office served the acknowledgment order, the order and notice of hearing and prehearing conference, the order to show cause, and the initial decision solely by U.S. mail; none of the certificates of service reflect electronic service of any document on any participant in the appeal. Where, as here, the notice and orders to which the appellant failed to respond were not served on his representative in the manner which the representative elected--a manner of service that he had a right to elect under the Board's own regulations--then all doubts about whether the appellant was prejudiced by the regional office's failure to follow the Board's regulations should be resolved in his favor. Accordingly, we find that it was an abuse of the AJ's discretion to dismiss the appellant's appeal for failure to prosecute under the circumstances presented.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may be an e-filer, and the representative may decide not to use e-filing. The representative may file by conventional means, including commercial delivery. Even if both the appellant and her attorney were registered as e-filers, counsel may file by non-electronic means, and the rules governing the date of service for that means of filing then apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Riggsbee v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 129, 131-32 &#x00B6; 7, 2009 MSPB 58 (2009) (citing 5 CFR 1201.14(f)). An exception: Board regulations require agencies and attorneys to use e-filing for appeals and pleadings (other than those with classified information or SSI) at the Washington Regional Office and the Denver Field Office. 5 CFR 1201.14(p)(1) (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some AJs become involved in email communications with parties who are not registered e-filers. Informal acceptance of an email by an AJ is not the same as a regulatorily-permissible filing with the Board. As to service of documents on parties, the Board does not preclude use of email service (e.g., transmittal of pdf files) among those who are not e-filers, but the regulations do not provide for that means of service, with the exception of discovery materials when the parties consent to that means of exchange. 5 CFR 1201.73(b) (2022). The author often sends pdf files to opposing counsel of what he files through e-filing--it is a courtesy, not a requirement.</p>
