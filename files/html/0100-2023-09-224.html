<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-221"><span class="space">a.</span> Conflicts</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A party may file a motion to challenge the representative of the opposing party in an attempt to disqualify the representative from the appeal. The authority for disqualification is 5 CFR 1201.31(b) (2022), with two grounds stated: conflict of interest and conflict of position. The AJ may also disqualify a representative without a party's motion. Fortunately, these challenges are rare, for they inject into adverse action litigation an element personal to the representative or to the representative's employer. It is bad enough that the parties are at loggerheads.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the challenge is presented by a party, under 5 CFR 1201.37(b) (2022) the motion should be filed within 15 days from receipt by that party of notice of the designated representative. If a timely challenge is not filed, the grounds for the challenge will not be considered on PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bowers v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 395, 397 (1982). This period may be extended for good cause if the basis for challenge is subsequently discovered. <span class="Italic">Collins v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 62, 65-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2003), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, noted as to an arguably late disqualification motion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge is empowered to disqualify a party's representative under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b), which provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A party may choose any representative as long as that person is willing and available to serve. The other party or parties may challenge the designation, however, on the ground that it involves a conflict of interest or a conflict of position. Any party who challenges the designation must do so by filing a motion with the judge within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of designation. The judge will rule on the motion before considering the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A copy of the appellant's petition for appeal designating Matthews as his representative was served on the agency on July 9, 2002. The agency filed its motion to disqualify Matthews on February 5, 2003. Thus, the <span id="Page_1205"></span>motion was filed beyond the deadline. Nonetheless, in promulgating the regulation setting the deadline for filing a motion to disqualify the opposing party's representative, the Board expressly recognized that the discovery of a representative's conflict of interest "might not be made until later in the proceeding." 44 Fed. Reg. 38,344 (1979). Accordingly, like other deadlines in the Board's regulations, the deadline for seeking disqualification of a party's representative "may be waived for good cause shown." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has never challenged the agency representative's assertion that the agency did not discover the potential conflict of interest until on or about December 9, 2002. It is understandable that among Matthews, Saenz, and the agency representative, the agency representative would be the last to become aware of a conflict; the agency representative was not involved in the consultation between Saenz and Matthews, nor did Matthews file anything on Saenz's behalf that the agency representative might have been expected to see. While it is true that the agency did not file a formal motion to disqualify Matthews until some after December 9, 2002, it did so only because Matthews denied that there was a conflict and the parties were unable to resolve the matter informally. Again, the agency provided the administrative judge with a copy of the December 9, 2002 letter that it sent to Matthews, thereby promptly apprising the administrative judge of the possible conflict of interest after it was discovered. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miles v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 418 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (a letter that the appellant served on the agency and filed with the administrative judge complaining that the agency had not fully responded to discovery requests was equivalent to a motion to compel discovery, even though it was not denominated as such). By alerting the administrative judge to the potential conflict of interest when it did, the agency ensured, in keeping with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b), that the administrative judge could rule on the conflict of interest question "before considering the merits of the appeal," and indeed, before the hearing at which Matthews would have cross examined Saenz. Under the circumstances of this particular case, the agency has shown good cause for not meeting the regulatory deadline for seeking Matthews' disqualification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Barred as untimely was a motion to disqualify an entire general counsel's office based on an alleged privileged disclosure of confidential information by appellant to one attorney in that office when the basis for potential disqualification was long known to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Jones v. SBA</span>, 121 MSPR 1, 6-7 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2014 MSPB 17 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agency's general counsel's office must be disqualified because Parham's alleged prior representation of the appellant created a conflict of interest that must be imputed to the entire office. She argues that "all this kind of litigation flows through [a single] supervisory attorney" and that the entire office must be disqualified because of the assumption "that attorneys, working together and practicing law in a professional association, share each other's and their clients' confidential information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">City &#x0026; County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc</span>., 135 P.3d 20, 25-26 (Cal. 2006)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's theory in support of disqualification of the entire general counsel's office does not depend on Parham's personal involvement in the present appeal. Instead, it depends only on the fact that Parham, who allegedly obtained confidential information through his prior representation of the appellant, works with other attorneys in the office and would therefore be expected to share that confidential information with his colleagues. Therefore, the appellant was aware of the alleged conflict involving the entire general counsel's office as soon as that office entered an appearance in this appeal on January 18, 2011. We therefore find that the appellant's July 15, 2013 motion to disqualify the entire general counsel's office was not filed within 15 days after the appellant became aware of the alleged conflict and was therefore filed almost 2 1/2 years late. Although the Board has waived the deadline for filing a motion to disqualify upon a showing of good cause, <span class="Italic">see Collins</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10,[1] we do not find good cause for the lengthy delay in this case. The agency in <span class="Italic">Collins</span> promptly contacted the appellant's counsel and the administrative judge upon learning of the possible conflict of interest and filed a formal motion to disqualify the appellant's counsel only after informal efforts to resolve the issue were unsuccessful. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6. In the present case, the appellant knew that the same office that employed Parham was representing the agency in her IRA appeal in January 2011, yet she took no action regarding that alleged conflict for more than 2 years. We therefore find that the motion to disqualify the agency's general counsel's office is untimely. However, we find that the appellant's motion with respect to disqualification of Parham only was timely filed within 15 days after Parham entered an appearance on behalf of the agency in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board in <span class="Italic">Collins</span> was applying a prior version of section 1201.31(b), which required a motion to disqualify to be filed within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of designation. <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 9. In November 2012, after the appellant filed her initial IRA appeal but before the motion to disqualify was filed, the Board amended the regulation to add the phrase "or 15 days after a party becomes aware of the conflict," in order "to acknowledge that a representative's conflict of interest may not be readily apparent to a party wishing to challenge the designation of a representative." 77 Fed. Reg. 62,350, 62,353 (Oct. 12, 2012). We find that this regulatory change does not affect our analysis of the timeliness issue in this case, however, because we find that the appellant became aware of the alleged conflict involving the agency's general counsel's office as soon as that office, which also employs Parham, entered an appearance in this case.</p>

Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0752-21-0142-I-1 (NP 6/29/2022) ("In the motion to disqualify, the appellant argued that there was a conflict of interest because the agency representative had previously advised the agency on matters regarding the appellant's employment. However, we agree with the administrative judge that this fact alone did not constitute a conflict of interest.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The opposing party must be given the opportunity for comment on a disqualification request before a ruling is made. The ruling must be made before consideration of the case on the merits; if the representative is disqualified, the party affected must be given reasonable time to get another representative. 5 CFR 1201.31(b) (2022). A party waives the right to seek disqualification of a representative if a motion is not timely filed. <span class="Italic">Bowers v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 395, 398 (1982). There is no direct appeal to the Board from an order disqualifying a representative. If a request for certification of an interlocutory appeal is made and denied, the issue presented by motion to the AJ is properly raised on PFR. <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 4 MSPR 357, 358 (1980). Under preexisting regulations, without a motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal, the disqualification issue was not preserved for a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Warren v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 426, 430 &#x00B6; 6 (2001). The regulation concerning an interlocutory appeal from disqualification of a representative is no longer in effect. One may still seek an interlocutory appeal, but that effort is not required to preserve the ability to challenge disqualification through a PFR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 225, 3 MSPB 321 (1980), considered an AJ's decision to disqualify a union representative from representing an appellant because the appellant's job could have required him to investigate members of the bargaining unit normally represented by the union for criminal violations. The Board noted that the terms "conflict of interest" and "conflict of position" are essentially the same, but with "conflict of interest" generally involving financial considerations. The concern of the agency was that allowing the union to represent the appellant, an investigator, might make it difficult for the investigator to recommend disciplinary action against individuals who were members of the union defending his appeal. The Board rejected the conflict argument, observing, first, that there was little factual basis for presuming that the appellant would be called upon to investigate fellow union members and, second, that the agency maintained sufficient control to correct the situation should any evidence of conflict materialize. The Board did not disregard the determination in <span class="Italic">Alberio v. Hampton</span>, 433 F. Supp. 447 (D.P.R. 1977), that a union could not represent a supervisor if the union represented his subordinates. Rather, <span class="Italic">Sweeney</span> considered too speculative the possibility that representation of the appellant by the union could result in divided loyalty. The Board reaffirmed its decision on an OPM reconsideration petition. Despite new theories of conflict posited by OPM, the possibility of a true conflict was too remote to warrant disqualification of the representative. <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 646, 649 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Law v. IRS</span>, 5 MSPR 141, 144, 5 MSPB 203 (1981) (same result when an attorney was disqualified from representing the appellant at an oral reply but not in a Board appeal; harmful error, however, was not established); <span class="Italic">Cowan v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 501 (1980) (same situation as <span class="Italic">Sweeney</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"A conflict of interest exists where former supervisors are represented by union officials who represent the supervisors' subordinates, because the supervisors might have their judgment compromised in the future if they are successful in their appeals and return to the supervisory functions." <span class="Italic">Warren v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 426, 429 &#x00B6; 5 (2001). The Board addressed an alleged conflict of interest involving appellant-supervisors and union representatives in <span class="Italic">Arnstein v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 515 (1982). The Board recalled that <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 225, 230-31, 3 MSPB 321 (1980), determined that an actual conflict must be demonstrated, and that no conflict exists if the appellant is not supervising employees in the representative's bargaining unit. A conflict existed in <span class="Italic">Arnstein:</span> if the supervisor was placed in the bargaining unit by the contested adverse action, his judgment could be compromised as to future employee appraisal and discipline if he proved successful in the appeal and returned to supervisory functions. But the Board declined to adopt a <span class="Italic">per</span> <span class="Italic">se</span> rule. Determinations are made on analysis of actual supervisory functions. <span class="Italic">Arnstein</span>, 10 MSPR at 518. In <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 622, 625 (1985), a union representative was disqualified. Appellant was a supervisor whose subordinate employees were represented by the union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alberio v. Hampton</span>, 433 F.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Collins v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 62 (2003), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, found the Board disqualifying an attorney from representing an appellant when that attorney previously <span id="Page_1206"></span>received information from an individual who sought, but did not retain, the attorney's services concerning possible sexual harassment that formed one part of the charges against the appellant. The problem, as the Board saw it, was that the attorney might have used information obtained from the individual who earlier sought the attorney's services during the cross-examination of that individual on behalf of the attorney's current client, the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying California bar rules, <span class="Italic">Jones v. SBA</span>, 121 MSPR 1, 4, 7-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 13-19, 2014 MSPB 17 (2014), declined to disqualify an agency attorney who, the appellant asserted, gained confidential information pertinent to her Board case (whistleblowing reprisal) during agency counsel's representational interaction with the appellant during an EEO proceeding when the appellant was a responding management official, witness, or potential witness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 2, 2013, the agency deactivated its prior representative in the appeal and designated Anthony Parham to represent it. On July 15, 2013, the appellant filed a motion to disqualify both Parham and the agency's entire general counsel's office based on an alleged conflict of interest. The appellant argued that Parham, in his capacity as an agency attorney, had represented her as one of the management officials named in equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints filed by other agency employees. She alleged that she voluntarily shared confidential information with Parham over the course of several months, until Parham told her that he was not representing her individually. She further alleged that Parham subsequently demanded that she continue providing information to him, and she complied. The appellant specifically alleged that she shared her whistleblowing disclosures with Parham. She argued that Parham's participation as agency counsel in the instant Board appeal constituted a conflict of interest under California rules of attorney conduct and that the agency's entire general counsel's office should be vicariously disqualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[A]n attorney appearing before the Board, whether representing a private party or an agency, will be expected to conform to applicable state rules governing attorney conduct." <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 17. When a hearing is scheduled to take place, the "applicable state rules governing attorney conduct" are those of the state in which the hearing is to be held. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we apply the California legal ethics standards in determining whether a conflict of interest exists in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> W-6 IAF, Tab 12 at 4 (identifying Glendale, California as the hearing location).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts applying California ethics rules have been cautious in granting motions to disqualify counsel based on conflict of interest "in order to avoid hardships on innocent clients where disqualifications are unnecessarily ordered." <span class="Italic">In re Lee G</span>., 1 Cal. App. 4th 17, 28 (1991) (citation omitted). "Because a motion to disqualify is most often tactically motivated and can be disruptive to the litigation process, disqualification is considered to be a drastic measure that is generally disfavored." <span class="Italic">Concat LP v. Unilever, PLC</span>, 350 F. Supp.2d 796, 814 (N.D. Cal. 2004). Courts are particularly reluctant to disqualify public counsel, as the appellant asks the Board to do in the instant case, because such disqualifications can result in "increased public expenditures for legal representation," and because of "the potential deprivation to the client of the services of an attorney highly skilled in a particular area of the law." <span class="Italic">In re Lee G</span>., 1 Cal. App. 4th at 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rule 3-310(E) of the California Rules of Professional Conduct, upon which the appellant relies in seeking to disqualify Parham from representing the agency in this appeal, provides that "[a]member shall not, without the informed written consent of the client or former client, accept employment adverse to the client or former client where, by reason of the representation of the client or former client, the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment." The appellant argues that she was, or should be treated as, Parham's former client for conflict purposes by virtue of their interactions during her time as an agency manager. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The role of a public attorney in representing the interests of individual government officials has been analogized to the representation of corporate officers by corporate counsel. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Superior Court</span>, 70 Cal. App. 3d 23, 32 (1977). Our analysis of cases involving corporate counsel supports the conclusion that no conflict of interest exists in the instant case. For example, in <span class="Italic">Meehan v. Hopps</span>, 144 Cal. App. 2d 284 (1956), at issue was whether corporate counsel could represent the interests of the corporation in litigation against a former director of the corporation. The court determined that, although the corporate counsel had worked with the former director on several legal matters relating to his official role within the corporation, there was no attorney-client relationship between the former director and the corporate counsel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 290. The court held that the corporate counsel did not have a disqualifying conflict and that the corporate counsel could use information obtained from the former director in the context of representing the corporation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 290-93. The court found no support for the proposition "that an attorney for a corporation is disqualified from representing it in an action brought by it against one of its officers, nor that in such an action the attorney may not use information received from such officers in connection with company matters." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 290. Applying the same rationale to the instant case, we find that there was no attorney-client relationship between the appellant and Parham that would prevent Parham from representing the agency in the appellant's Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Cal. Ethics Op. 2001-156</span>, 2001 WL 34029610, at *3 (Cal. St. Bar Comm. Prof. Resp.) ("[A]n attorney for a governmental entity usually has only one client, namely, the entity itself...."). The appellant's interactions with Parham regarding official agency business did not create a personal attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant and Parham never formed an actual attorney-client relationship, the California State Bar Standing Committee on Professional Responsibility and Conduct has warned that "attorneys should note the risk that personal attorney-client relationships could be formed intentionally or inadvertently with government officials if the attorney's conduct and the circumstances create a reasonable expectation on the part of the official that he or she enjoys a personal confidential relationship with the attorney." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *3 n.1. We have therefore considered the appellant's allegations in order to determine whether she reasonably expected that she had a personal confidential relationship with Parham. As explained below, we find that, even if the appellant genuinely believed that she had such a relationship with Parham, that belief was not reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the declaration submitted in support of her motion to disqualify, the appellant states that, when Parham was assigned to assist her in connection with the EEO investigations, he told her "that although the EEO case was technically against the SBA Administrator, that individuals are often accused and could be held liable for their actions, and that he was appointed to defend the case against the agency and me...." Elsewhere in her declaration, the appellant states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This was the first time I had been involved in any EEO complaints, and quite frankly, I just did not know that the case was against the SBA Administrator and not me. Parham told me that although the EEO case was technically against the SBA Administrator, individuals accused like me could be disciplined just because I was accused; hence, I had to share as much information with him as possible to ensure that he can defend me and the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">She notes that, when she was interviewed by the EEO investigator and the investigator asked whether Parham was there as the appellant's representative, Parham answered, "Yes, that's right." The appellant states that, because Parham gave that answer to the EEO investigator, she "didn't question the fact that he was representing me, protecting my interests."[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency disputes the appellant's account of what Parham told her about his role in the EEO investigation. We need not resolve any factual disputes, however, because we find that the appellant has not established a basis for disqualifying Parham, even if we accept all of her allegations as true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant reasonably believed that Parham was representing her interests in the EEO investigation. However, by the appellant's own account, Parham told her that he was appointed to defend the case against both the appellant and the agency, and that she needed to provide him with information to assist him in defending both her and the agency. There is no indication that the interests of the appellant and the agency with respect to the EEO investigations were ever at odds, and therefore Parham's representation of the agency's interests also served to protect the appellant's interests. Parham never told the appellant that he would protect her personal interests even if those interests were contrary to the interests of the agency. Yet the appellant seems to have concluded that Parham, an attorney employed by the agency, was representing her personal interests in other matters, even if those interests differed from those of the agency; she also seems to have concluded that information she provided to Parham while they were both performing their official duties as agency employees would be kept confidential from agency management. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 7 of 21 ("I now know that [Parham]did not just keep the information to himself, he shared it with other General Counsel, Human Capital Management staff, and senior managers."). To the extent the appellant believed Parham would keep matters she shared with him confidential from their common employer, or that he would represent her interests against those of the agency, we find no reasonable basis for that belief. We therefore conclude that the appellant has not demonstrated that Parham's representation of the agency in this IRA appeal creates an impermissible conflict of interest.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cases filed by the Special Counsel present difficulties. OSC may bring a prohibited personnel practice charge against both an agency manager and the agency. When both are represented by the same attorney, both are owed the same duty of allegiance. This makes it difficult for the attorney to properly represent both at the same time if, for example, the manager would like to settle to avoid a personal sanction, while the agency's interests are best served by not settling and putting OSC to its burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DHUD</span>, 15 MSPR 204, 207-09 (1983), considered two related issues: first, whether an <span id="Page_1207"></span>agency attorney may represent both the agency and the employee being interviewed by OSC during its investigation; second, whether the Board has the authority to entertain a motion by OSC for an injunction to prevent the agency from effectively insisting on this representational right as a condition of the interview. The Board concluded that it did not have the authority to issue an injunction because the Special Counsel had other means to obtain the ruling it sought, and the Board implied that the right to counsel in OSC investigations was liberally implied under the Administrative Procedure Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The threshold question is whether the Board has jurisdiction to issue an order in the nature of an injunction to prevent interference with a Special Counsel investigation. The Special Counsel bases his jurisdictional arguments on 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1) and (2), which provide, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under [Title 5] ...;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under the authority granted under paragraph (1)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel reasons that "any interference with, or frustration of, [his]investigations frustrates the Board's responsibility" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1). He also argues that the use of the term "matter," as opposed to "case" or "controversy," in these subsections indicates Congressional intent that the Board have authority to issue a wide range of orders and decisions. He further argues that Congress intended the Board and the Special Counsel to have "authority and power broad enough to enable them to carry out the functions entrusted to them by the Act." He concludes, therefore, that the Board has the authority to enjoin agency counsel from representing both agency employees and the agency in OSC investigative interviews.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel's conclusion, however, is unsupported by either the legislative history or the language of the Civil Service Reform Act. While it is true that the Special Counsel must conduct investigations in order to pursue corrective or disciplinary action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1), (g)(1)(A), and that investigations also may be conducted to determine whether a petition for a stay is warranted in the interim, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1208, it does not necessarily follow that the Board has jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature of an injunction to prevent alleged interference with the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of the statutory scheme and legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act reveals no indication that Congress intended the Board to have the authority to order injunctive relief in Special Counsel investigations. Instead the statute reveals that the Special Counsel alone is responsible for investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206(a)(1). As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. Special Counsel</span> (Stacy), Docket No. HQ12068110061 (November 18, 1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The relationship of the Special Counsel to the Board is analogous to that of a prosecuting attorney to a court. The Special Counsel has statutory authority to conduct investigations of alleged prohibited personnel practices. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1206, 1208. The Board has no authority to supervise or direct the manner in which these investigations are conducted. <span class="Italic">In re Tarelia</span> [1 MSPB 151, 152 n.5 (1979)] .... In addition, the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act makes it clear that Congress intended the Special Counsel to be independent from the Board. Therefore, we must conclude that the Board has no jurisdiction to interfere with the independent investigative and prosecutorial authority of the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also Jones v.</span> <span class="Italic">HHS,</span> 8 MSPB 607 (1981) ("The Special Counsel has independent investigatory and prosecutorial authority under the Civil Service Reform Act.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the statute provides a specific means by which the Special Counsel can obtain the relief he requests, i.e., by subpoenaing the three employees. If they refuse to testify without agency counsel, and agency counsel insists on representing both the employee and the agency, the Special Counsel can petition a Federal district court for enforcement of the subpoena. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(c). The Special Counsel has promulgated regulations implementing this enforcement procedure. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1255.1(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitions for enforcement of subpoenas have frequently been used by agencies as a means of obtaining rulings on the issue of whether the person who received the subpoena was entitled under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to be represented by a particular attorney during an investigative interview. <span class="Italic">See SEC v.</span> <span class="Italic">Csapo,</span> 533 F.2d 7 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">SEC v. Higashi,</span> 359 F.2d 550 (9th Cir. 1966); <span class="Italic">Backer v. Commissioner,</span> 275 F.2d 141 (5th Cir. 1960) (IRS). The APA provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person compelled to appear in person before an agency or representative thereof is entitled to be accompanied, represented, and advised by counsel or, if permitted by the agency, by other qualified representative. [5 USC &#x00A7; 555(b).]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel has argued that the APA does not apply to Board proceedings, citing <span class="Italic">Richardson v. EPA,</span> 5 MSPB 289, 290 n.1 (1981). However, <span class="Italic">Richardson</span> referred only to 5 USC &#x00A7; 556 as being inapplicable to Board proceedings. While the Board's formal adjudications are not subject to the requirements of that section or to sections 554 or 557, by virtue of the exemption in section 554(a)(2), that exemption is not extended to section 555(b). Therefore, we believe 5 USC &#x00A7; 555(b) is applicable to the situation now before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, in view of the availability of a specific statutory remedy for the Special Counsel's problem and the absence of any statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Board over Special Counsel investigations, the Special Counsel's Motion for an Order in the Nature of an Injunction is DENIED.</p>
