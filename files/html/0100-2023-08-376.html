<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-368"><span class="space">f.</span> Improper Assessment of Qualifications</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA can be violated by improper selection practices. In <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), a case litigated over the course of years, it was determined that the agency, although allowing applicants to submit job applications in many formats, had an internal and externally unknown practice of considering only certain documents to determine qualifications for a position, rather than examining the entire application package. In Mr. Kirkendall's case, the agency practice had the effect of excluding from agency consideration information that plainly qualified him for the job he sought--a job that he maintained was the same, in its civilian iteration, as the military position he previously filled. The court noted the requirement of 5 USC 3311:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Preference eligibles; examinations; crediting experience</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In examinations for the competitive service in which experience is an element of qualification, a preference eligible is entitled to credit--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;for all experience material to the position for which examined, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether he received pay therefor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Based on that statute, the court concluded that VEOA was violated and remanded the case for determination of a remedy, <span class="Italic">id</span>., 573 F.3d at 1324-25:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kirkendall presents this court with the same undisputed facts and the same clear statute, both of which the board overlooked in deciding his VEOA claim. We can barely imagine a stronger case of violation of a veteran's preference rights. Section 3311(2) guarantees that any experience of a veteran that is material to the position for which the veteran is examined will be credited. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3311(2). At the very least, "credited" must mean "considered." On the facts of this case, the agency admitted that Mr. Kirkendall's military documents contained information about Mr. Kirkendall's experience in relation to the specific experience required by the job announcement. That information was simply ignored. The agency deemed it "irrelevant" because it had not been printed in the two-page, self-made application that Mr. Kirkendall submitted in response to the announcement that invited him to use any written form he wished. Indeed, Mr. Gentry, when explaining the agency's practice of requiring all information to be a single document, testified somewhat sheepishly that "I'm sorry it sounds process-oriented." Failure to give credit to Mr. Kirkendall's military documents is undeniable evidence of error by the agency in processing his application. And that error is a confession of breach of the duty owed to the veteran under section 3311(2) to give him credit for "all experience material to the position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore reverse the final decision of the board. Mr. Kirkendall's VEOA rights were indeed violated, and he is entitled to corrective relief. We wish to be clear, however, on the nature of the VEOA violation in this case. We hold only that the agency violated Mr. Kirkendall's right to have his experience, as related in his military documents, credited as part of his application. We do not opine on whether, if Mr. Kirkendall's name should have been on the final competing list, he should have been awarded the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kirkendall is entitled to an appropriate remedy for the violation of his VEOA rights. The board has much experience with crafting remedies for VEOA violations and, for that reason, we remand the case to the board for it, in the first instance, to craft appropriate relief for Mr. Kirkendall.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96 (2006), the offending agency offered to correct its procedural VEOA violation by giving the veteran priority consideration for the next appropriate vacancy of the same grade and occupation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 98. The board rejected the offer of priority consideration as inadequate under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[P]riority consideration for a future vacancy is a remedy that provides prospective relief for the denial of the opportunity to compete, but it does not correct the agency's error with respect to the actual position for which the agency denied the appellant consideration. In the context of a VEOA appeal, such relief would be inappropriate because VEOA requires the Board to do more than merely provide a remedy for a past wrong; it mandates that the Board "shall order the agency to comply with" the violated provisions.... Therefore, where an agency violates a statute related to veterans' preference by denying the appellant the right to compete for a particular position, the Board must craft a remedy that allows the appellant to compete for the position, [and] allows the Board to determine whether the appellant suffered any loss of wages or benefits by reason of the violation.... Reconstruction of the selection process requires the agency to comply with the provisions it violated....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3330c(a) specifies that the board "shall order the agency to comply" with the particular VEOA right that it violated. We agree that an offer of prospective relief, such as priority consideration for a future job opening, is insufficient to remedy the VEOA violation in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency improperly excludes a veteran from the selection process because the agency incorrectly determines that the individual does not meet OPM qualification requirements, a VEOA violation is established, as in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 110 MSPR 184, 186-90 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12, 2008 MSPB 235 (2008) (following remand, again remanding, <span class="Italic">Phillips v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 19, 2010 MSPB 75 (2010)) [the 2008 <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> decision was overruled as to VEOA right to compete claim for merit promotion positions sought by federal employees, <span class="Italic">Oram v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2022 MSPB 30 (2022)]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of his appeal, the appellant was employed as a police officer, GS-0083-06, step 10. On or around July 30, 2007, the appellant applied for higher grade police officer positions under vacancy announcement number DON0083, which was an open continuous announcement in various locations. The appellant was not selected for any position under this vacancy announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result of his nonselection, he filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL). DOL subsequently informed the appellant that his complaint lacked merit because "[v]eterans [p]reference points only apply to positions advertised as open competitive or Delegated Examining Unit," and this announcement utilized merit promotion procedures. Moreover, DOL concluded that he had only indicated that he was interested in GS-0083-08 positions in Dahlgren, Virginia, the positions that were being filled in that area were GS-0083-07 positions and he "did not indicate an interest in GS-0083-07 positions." The appellant timely filed this appeal. In it, he also alleged that the agency discriminated against veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, generally, a nonselection is not an action directly appealable to the Board, but it may be appealable under the VEOA. <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 4 (2003). In order to establish Board jurisdiction over a "right to compete" VEOA claim, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible or veteran within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), (ii) the actions at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of VEOA, and (iii) the agency denied him the right to compete for a vacant position in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).[1] <span class="Italic">See Styslinger v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 13 (2007); <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 6 (2003); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 U.S.C. 3330a. There was no dispute below that the appellant exhausted his remedy with DOL with respect to this vacancy announcement, he is a 5-point preference eligible, and the nonselection at issue took place after VEOA's enactment date. Moreover, the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that the agency denied him the right to compete by "fail[ing] to allow [him] to interview for [a] position [for which he] was qualified." [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Elliott v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (an allegation by an appellant, in general terms, that his veterans' preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the nonfrivolous allegation requirement). Accordingly, the administrative judge properly concluded that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board has held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) "stands in some relation to, has a bearing on, concerns, and has a connection with veterans' preference rights and is, therefore, a statute 'relating to veterans' preference' for which VEOA provides a remedy in the event of a violation thereof." <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 16 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant argues that the agency did not indicate that the position was being announced under merit promotion procedures and he was denied the "right to compete" for the position. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) (explaining that veterans and preference eligibles "may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures"). We note that an agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.101, and this vacancy announcement appears to have utilized merit promotion procedures. ("If you are a current or former permanent Federal employee, are eligible for a Veterans' Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA), or a non-competitive hiring authority as defined on the Common Hiring Program Category Definitions, apply now.") Therefore, the appellant's first PFR argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_694"></span>As to the appellant's second PFR argument, that he was denied the right to compete for the vacant positions, we note that his July 30, 2007 application was accepted for vacancy announcement number DON0083. His resume indicated that he was applying for a position as a "Supervisory Police Officer GS-0083 Sergent [sic] GS-7 or Lieutenant GS-8." However, for reasons that are unclear, another page of his application showed that he was only interested in the GS-8 position. The agency admitted below that it did not consider him for the GS-7 position because he "did not indicate interest in the GS-0083-07 position." The agency's position, therefore, is contradicted by the evidence it submitted into the record below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the GS-8 position, the appellant argued that he had "over 25 years experience" as well as "vast work knowledge in the area of Police Work [and] he [did] qualify per [the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's)] regulation." The agency submitted OPM's Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions, which explained that positions that are "GS-6 and above" require specialized experience of "1 year equivalent to at least next lower grade level." The Manual also provided some examples of such specialized experience:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Experience that provided knowledge of a body of basic laws and regulations, law enforcement operations, practices, and techniques and involved responsibility for maintaining order and protecting life and property. Creditable specialized experience may have been gained in work on a police force; through service as a military police officer; in work providing visitor protection and law enforcement in parks, forests, or other natural resource or recreational environments; in performing criminal investigative duties; or in other work that provided the required knowledge and skills.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was no evidence in the record that the agency actually considered whether the appellant's listed experience would satisfy OPM's requirement. Rather, it appears from the agency's submission that it relied on the single fact that the appellant was a GS-6 to conclude that he did not have the minimum qualifications for a GS-8 position. ("Appellant was not qualified for promotion to the GS-0083-08 position because, as a GS-06, he did not have the required one year experience equivalent to at least the next lower grade level, GS-07.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge did not address the fact that the agency's argument regarding the GS-7 position was contradicted by its own evidence, nor did she require the agency to provide affidavits or other evidence to clarify its position. The administrative judge also did not address whether factors other than time in the next lower grade could have qualified the appellant for consideration for the GS-8 position. Rather, she simply concluded that "[w]hile [the appellant's] complaints may have merit, they do not establish a violation of his right to veteran's preference and thus do not fall under the Board's jurisdiction."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record evidence, we conclude that the appellant is entitled to corrective action because the agency's admission that it did not consider his application for the GS-7 position is sufficient to establish that the agency denied him the opportunity to compete for this vacancy, as envisioned under 5 U.S.C. 3304(f)(1). An individual whose rights have been violated in this manner is entitled to a selection process consistent with applicable statutes and regulations relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Deems v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-19 (2005). Based on the appellant's geographical preference of Dahlgren, Virginia, and the fact that there was at least one GS-7 position that was filled at that location, the agency must reconstruct the selection process for the GS-7 position(s) at this location under this vacancy announcement to allow the appellant an opportunity to compete. <span class="Italic">Deems,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the GS-8 position, we are similarly concerned that the agency's "consideration" of his July 30, 2007 application may have also improperly denied him the opportunity to compete for that vacant position. Because the evidentiary record is not sufficiently developed on this issue, however, we cannot determine with certainty that the appellant was denied an opportunity to compete for any GS-8 positions advertised under this vacancy announcement, such that his veterans' preference rights were violated.[3] Therefore, we are remanding this appeal to the Washington Regional Office for further development of the record and adjudication of the appellant's VEOA claim regarding the GS-8 position. On remand, the administrative judge shall direct the agency to provide evidence and argument explaining whether it considered the possibility that, for the GS-8 position, the appellant's prior work experience qualified as specialized experience of 1 year equivalent to the next lower grade level, and whether the agency should have considered him for any available GS-8 positions.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For example, if the agency properly found that the appellant was not qualified for the GS-8 position, its failure to further consider him would not violate VEOA. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v. Department of the Navy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 604, 118 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the appellant retains the ultimate burden of proof, <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10, review dismissed, 199 Fed. Appx. 948 (Fed. Cir. 2006), the agency has the burden of producing evidence regarding the extent to which it considered the appellant's application for the GS-8 position, because it is the only party with access to such evidence. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lomax v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559-60 (1998) ("An appellant should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his or her pay, since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the appellant's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Porter v. Dept. of Labor</span>, CH-3330-17-0169-I-1 (NP 4/27/2023) (applicant with veterans preference under the Recent Graduates Program: the agency improperly required evidence of an academic degree rather than evidence of completion of educational requirements).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The applicant with veterans preference is not entitled to selection, but consideration must be <span class="Italic">bona fide,</span> <span class="Italic">Davidson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-3330-14-0603-I-1 (NP 12/15/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preference eligibles or veterans who have been separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after 3 years or more of active service may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). The right to compete under section 3304(f)(1) does not require that the veteran or preference eligible be considered at every stage of the selection process up to that process's final stage but does require that the individual be permitted to compete on the same basis as the other candidates. <span class="Italic">Harellson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 11 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant is a preference-eligible veteran, and the agency accepted applications for the position at issue from individuals outside its own workforce. It is also undisputed that the appellant applied for the position, his application was reviewed and the agency deemed him qualified, and his name was forwarded to the selecting official for consideration on the same certificate that was ultimately used to make the selections. These facts suggest that the appellant received some consideration, which might satisfy the agency's obligation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 505 F.3d 1380, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding that a veteran was given a full opportunity to compete when he applied, was found qualified, and was interviewed for a position but not selected); <span class="Italic">Harellson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 534, &#x00B6; 11 (stating that the same evidence establishing that the agency accepted and considered the appellant's application also indicates that he was permitted to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the undisputed facts, however, there remain genuine disputes of material fact regarding what, if any, consideration the selecting official gave the appellant's application. Specifically, the appellant has established a genuine dispute regarding whether the agency "inappropriately applied nepotism rules," and erroneously eliminated him from consideration, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3. The Board has found that a veteran is denied his right to compete under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) when an agency accepts his application, and determines that he is qualified, but the selecting official does not give his application any further consideration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shapley v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-17 (2008) (holding that the appellant was denied the right to compete when he was found qualified for a position, was placed on the certificate of eligibles, but the certificate was not provided to the selecting official for consideration). The appellant alleges that the selecting official improperly excluded him from competition for invalid reasons other than merit, which presents a genuine dispute of material fact. <span class="Italic">Cf. Modeste v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2014) (an agency cannot rely on a labor agreement to justify its failure to consider a veteran in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) by improperly segregating applicants); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (an agency's internal policy may not override applicable statutes, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1)); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Navy</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2008) (examining the agency's explanation for not further considering the appellant's application). Because there remain genuine disputes of material fact, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal for a hearing on the merits of the appellant's VEOA right-to-compete claim.</p>

His argument is unavailing because it is based on the faulty premise that the agency was required to use the category rating system and was precluded from using the merit promotion process to make a selection for the position at issue. The administrative judge fully addressed the statutes and implementing regulations concerning the category rating system and properly found that they did not preclude the agency from utilizing the merit promotion procedure to make a selection. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.301-.305.

That is an incorrect understanding of the category rating system; further, it is contradicted by Board precedent. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3304(f), 3319; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.301-.305; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v.

<p class="Body-Text">A VEOA violation is not established because the agency arguably hired someone less qualified than the appellant, <span class="Italic">Gingery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The VEOA prohibits an agency from denying a preference-eligible employee the opportunity to compete for a position, but it does not guarantee that the preference-eligible applicant must be selected for the position. <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). The appellant was clearly allowed to compete for the GAS position, in that: he applied for the position; the agency considered him for the position; his name was among those forwarded to the selecting official for consideration under the job announcement; and he was interviewed for the position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review the appellant also reiterates his argument from below that, in the selection process for the GAS position, the agency incorrectly used a category rating and ranking procedure rather than a numerical ranking and rating procedure. As the administrative judge explained, even if this were true, the agency's use of the category rating and ranking procedure did not impair the appellant's ability to compete, as he was one of the top three candidates on the referral list and he was interviewed for the position. Consequently, this argument provides no basis to disturb the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the candidates selected for the position were not entitled to veterans' preference and he contends that the selected candidates did not qualify for the position because the documentation in the record suggests that they lack any college education. As the administrative judge noted, the record shows that the two applicants selected were preference-eligible veterans. Further, whether these candidates qualified for the position has no effect on the issue of whether the agency violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights; as explained above, the appellant was allowed to compete for the position under the job announcement, and the fact that the agency exercised its discretion to fill the vacancy by hiring two other preference-eligible candidates did not deny the appellant the opportunity to compete for the position.</p>
