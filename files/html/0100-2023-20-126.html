<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not require as a basis for its jurisdiction, that an IRA appellant correctly label a category of wrongdoing under section 2302(b)(8). However, the disclosures must be specific and detailed, not vague allegations of wrongdoing regarding broad or imprecise matters. <span class="Italic">McCorcle v. USDA</span>, 98 MSPR 363, 373 &#x00B6; 18 (2005). OSC can be expected to know which categories of wrongdoing might be implicated by a particular set of facts. <span class="Italic">Lane v. DHS</span>, 115 MSPR 342, 349 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 245 (2010); <span class="Italic">see McAlpine v. SSA</span>, AT-1221-16-0301-W-1 (NP 2/21/2023) ("However, the Board has held that the key to determining whether an appellant has satisfied the exhaustion requirement in an IRA appeal is whether she provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation, not whether she correctly labeled the category of wrongdoing; OSC can be expected to know which category of wrongdoing might be implicated by a particular set of factual allegations. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 224, 236-37 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32, 37 (2000).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem of precise pleading and the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant was addressed in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/THOMAS_KENN_W_AT_1221_96_0406_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199877.pdf">77 MSPR 224</a>, 236-38 (1998), an appeal that provided the Board with the opportunity to soften the restrictive pleading requirements created by <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 521 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, overruling some Board law, determined that it is sufficient if the appellant presents the operative facts to OSC without classifying resulting prohibited personnel practices under 5 USC 2302(b)(8):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Ward</span> could be interpreted as creating a "correct labeling" requirement, i.e., if an OSC complainant alleges that he disclosed information which he reasonably believed evidences whistleblowing within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), but incorrectly identifies which section (b)(8) category of wrongdoing is involved, then his IRA appeal to the Board must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, regardless of whether the facts alleged evidence a different section (b)(8) category of wrongdoing. If <span class="Italic">Ward</span> is interpreted in this way, then this appeal would have to be dismissed because, in his second OSC complaint, the appellant unequivocally characterized his disclosures as evidencing a violation of law, rule, or regulation, not an abuse of authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that construing <span class="Italic">Ward</span> to include a correct labeling requirement would be inconsistent with the overarching purpose of the exhaustion requirement--to give OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action. If an IRA appellant has set forth factual allegations in his OSC complaint which, if proven, would establish an abuse of authority, but he mistakenly labels the allegations as a violation of law, rule, or regulation, we believe that he has nonetheless given OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action.[9] As the agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting cases involving retaliation for whistleblowing disclosures under the WPA, OSC can be expected to know what section (b)(8) category[ies] of wrongdoing might be implicated by a particular set of factual allegations. The mere fact that a complainant has invoked the wrong (b)(8) label should therefore not prevent OSC from taking appropriate investigatory and corrective action. Requiring an appellant to correctly label his claim of whistleblowing is the sort of artificial distinction or technicality that led to the enactment of the WPA of 1989. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1988).[10]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The Senate Report contains the following language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Fiorillo v. Department of Justice</span> (795 F.2d 1544, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1986)) an employee's disclosures were not considered protected because the employee's "primary motivation" was not for the public good, but rather for the personal motives of the employee. The court reached this conclusion despite the lack of any indication in CSRA that an employee's motives are supposed to be considered in determining whether a disclosure is protected. The Committee intends that disclosures be encouraged. The OSC, the Board and the courts should not erect barriers to disclosures which will limit the necessary flow of information from employees who have knowledge of government wrongdoing<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In his dissent in <span class="Italic">Costin v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 517, 533-34, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 42 F.3d 1409 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), Chairman Erdreich similarly complained that the Board, by insisting on an unreasonably high level of specificity in the allegations presented to OSC "effectively places an obstacle in the path of those who seek relief from reprisal for revealing wrongdoing by government officials...." <span class="Italic">See also Brown v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 355, 357-58 (short-form Order, Chairman Erdreich, dissenting) (citing remarks by Congressman McClosky critical of the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Costin), aff'd,</span> 64 F.3d 675 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as statutory sections relating to the same subject should be interpreted so as to be consistent with one another, and so that no statutory language is rendered inoperative or superfluous, the court's statements about the exhaustion requirement should be interpreted so as to be consistent with another, and so that no part of the opinion is rendered inoperative or superfluous. Interpreting <span class="Italic">Ward</span> to include a correct labeling requirement would be inconsistent with, and render inoperative, the court's statements in <span class="Italic">Knollenberg, Ward,</span> and subsequent decisions that the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to give OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only way to read the "precise ground" and "subsequent characterization" language so as to be consistent with the court's statements about the purpose of the exhaustion requirement is to treat correct labeling as one factor to be considered in determining whether an appellant has provided OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that may lead to corrective action. Viewed in this light, the reason that Ward's complaint to OSC was insufficient to give the Special Counsel a basis to investigate whether his agency retaliated against him for disclosing gross waste was not simply that he labeled it as gross mismanagement, but that the facts he alleged were more consistent with gross mismanagement than with gross waste. In particular, Ward failed to tell the Special Counsel, as he later did tell the Board (his "subsequent characterization"), that, but for his disclosure, the agency would have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these principles to the instant case, we think that the appellant did supply OSC with sufficient information to enable the Special Counsel to conduct an investigation to determine whether the agency retaliated against him for disclosing an abuse of authority, even though he referred to his factual allegations as evidencing a violation of law, rule, or regulation. It would be unreasonable to expect a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> complainant to understand that the correct section (b)(8) category for complaining about the way an agency has handled a grievance, and specifically that the agency assigned a person named as the subject of the grievance to investigate and decide the grievance, is an abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">See Loyd,</span> 69 MSPR at 689. It is also unreasonable to expect such an individual to understand that abuse of authority is also the correct category for an allegation that the agency discriminated against an entire class of employees in its selection process." <span class="Italic">See Mitchell,</span> 68 MSPR at 511. Yet the appellant made both of these specific factual allegations against the agency in his complaint to OSC. We think he thereby gave OSC sufficient information on which to investigate whether the agency retaliated against him for disclosing an abuse of authority, and satisfied the exhaustion requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mount v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20190829102">937 F.3d 37</a>, 44-48 (1st Cir. 2019), remanded an IRA appeal with criticism of the Board for limiting the scope of the appellant's claim when his complaint to OSC recited the operative events, claimed that he was a whistleblower, but omitted reference to being perceived as a whistleblower:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Below, the MSPB found that Mount failed to exhaust his perceived assistance claim and therefore it had no jurisdiction to entertain it. Relying on Federal Circuit precedent requiring that the employee inform the Special Counsel of the "precise ground" of his or her whistleblowing charge, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[t]he employee must inform [OSC] of the precise ground of his charge of whistleblowing."); <span class="Italic">Carney v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, 449 n.2 (2014),[7] the MSPB explained that Mount had never "<span class="Italic">expressly</span>" raised a perceived whistleblower claim before the OSC; and that such "theory was never mentioned in the first iteration of this case." Additionally, the MSPB found that a "parsing of [Mount's assertions to OSC] does not reveal any alleged facts that would put OSC on notice of" the perceived assistance claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;These cases addressed the factual sufficiency of employees' OSC complaints, not whether a particular legal theory was adequately raised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mount asserts that he exhausted the claim because the "OSC documents reveal facts that were articulate[d] with reasonable clarity and precision" and would have put the OSC on notice of said claim. On the other hand, the DHS argues that the fact that Mount did not expressly mention his perceived assistance claim in his OSC complaint is dispositive. In support, it seizes on the Federal Circuit's "precise ground" formulation to assert that the "test for exhaustion is not what claims OSC could or might infer from the face of an appellant's OSC complaint." We review the MSPB's legal conclusion that Mount failed to exhaust administrative remedies <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See Delgado v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 880 F.3d 913, 916 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">as amended on denial of reh'g and reh'g en banc</span> (7th Cir. 2018).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The MSPB, as well as the Federal and Tenth Circuits, frame this exhaustion requirement as jurisdictional. According to the Federal Circuit, "[w]hether the Board had jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal is a question of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>." <span class="Italic">Rosario-F&#x00E1; bregas v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 833 F.3d 1342, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">see also Acha v. Dep't of Agric</span>., 841 F.3d 878, 883 (10th Cir. 2016) (deeming exhaustion to OSC requirement as jurisdictional). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit has called the jurisdictional characterization into question, noting that "[W]e see nothing in the statutory language...mandating that conclusion, particularly in light of the Supreme Court's recent jurisprudence requiring clear signals that a rule is truly jurisdictional rather than a 'case-processing rule' that need not be enforced as jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 925 n.3 (citing <span class="Italic">Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick</span>, 559 U.S. 154 (2010)); <span class="Italic">see also Arbaugh v. Y &#x0026; H Corp</span>., 546 U.S. 500 (2006). The parties here have not raised the issue, and we need not decide it to resolve this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After careful consideration, we find that Mount asserts the correct position. First, we note that the text of the WPA does not dictate such a stringent exhaustion requirement. The statute simply states that the employee "shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). As the Seventh Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The exhaustion language in the statute is simple and brief.... We do not see why this directive should be read to require a federal employee (who typically is not trained in the law) to present to the OSC a perfectly packaged case ready for litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">880 F.3d at 923-24.[9] Furthermore, Section 2 of the WPA states that its purpose "<span class="Italic">is to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees</span>, to prevent reprisals, and to eliminate wrongdoing within the Government." Pub. L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7; 2(b), 103 Stat. 16, 16 (1989) (emphasis added). Thus, without explicit language, we will not construct the exhaustion requirement in a way that drastically conditions the rights that the WPA seeks to protect and makes it harder for whistleblowers to obtain relief. <span class="Italic">See Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 924 ("[t]he [MSPB's] stringent application of the [WPA's] exhaustion requirement can effectively prevent all but the savviest federal whistleblowers from receiving a hearing on the merits.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, the Seventh Circuit addressed an MSPB decision that was excessively stringent with respect to the sufficiency of the <span class="Italic">factual</span> allegations presented to the OSC. 880 F.3d at 923.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the legislative history of the statute, as amended, does not suggest that Congress intended such a legally technical exhaustion requirement.[10] To the contrary, while not in the context of the specific exhaustion issue before us, Congress has repeatedly reiterated its whistleblower-protecting mandate. For instance, the House Report accompanying the bill for the 1994 WPA amendments listed fourteen examples of ways in which "[t]he body of case law developed by the [MSPB] and Federal Circuit has represented a steady attack on achieving the legislative mandate for effective whistleblower protection." H.R. Rep. No. 103-769, at 17 (1994). Speaking on the House Floor on the day that body approved a Senate amendment to the House-passed bill, the bill's sponsor, Representative Pete McCloskey, said that "[A]new example...may be the most significant": the practice of "requiring whistleblowers to identify the precise personnel actions at issue in their initial complaint to the Office of Special Counsel." 140 Cong. Rec. H11419-01 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey), 1994 WL 564324, at *H11422; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Thomas M. Devine, <span class="Italic">The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989: Foundation for the Modern Law of Employment Dissent</span>, 51 Admin. L. Rev. 531, 570, n.218 (1999). While the issue of identifying the precise personnel action is distinct from the one at hand--identifying the precise legal theory--the logic underlying Representative McCloskey's concern is largely applicable. As he explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">First this burden forces employees without counsel to fashion their complaints in legally technical language. Second, it is unrealistic, because often the full scope of reprisals is not exposed until the complaint is investigated or otherwise pursued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">140 Cong. Rec. H11419-01 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey), 1994 WL 564324, at *H11422.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 924-25 ("We think Congress intended the exhaustion requirement simply to give the OSC and the employing agency a chance to resolve issues without litigation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, when Congress further amended the WPA in 2012 and 2014, it expressed concern with the Federal Circuit's restrictive rulings disfavoring alleged whistleblowers. In 2012, the relevant Senate Report bemoaned that "federal whistleblowers have seen their protections diminish in recent years, largely as a result of a series of decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit." S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 1 (2012). And in 2014, the House Report accompanying the All Circuit Review Extension Act of 2014 noted that the authorization of all-circuit review was "prompted" by "the Federal Circuit's overwhelming record of ruling against whistleblowers...." H.R. Rep. No. 113-519, pt. 1, at 2 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, as recently as 2018, the Senate Report accompanying the All Circuit Review Act approvingly cited the Seventh Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> for "differ[ing] from the Federal Circuit." S. Rep. No. 115-229, at 3 (2018) (citing <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d 913). As noted earlier, <span class="Italic">Delgado</span> construed the exhaustion requirement leniently by holding that a complainant need not include "every detail that might be necessary to prove at trial." <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 925. The Senate Report stated that "[s]uch a 'split in the circuit' was intended to occur with all-circuit review authority, allowing courts to critically review each other's decisions...and increase accountability in their interpretations of the laws." S. Rep. No. 115-229, at 3 (2018). While the Senate Report did not expressly adopt or commend the Seventh Circuit's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, it supported "permanently authoriz[ing] the all-circuit review authority...for Federal employee whistleblower claims." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore believe the correct approach is to interpret the WPA's exhaustion requirement "more consistently with other statutory exhaustion schemes," such as those of the Federal Tort Claims Act ("FTCA") and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ("Title VII"). <span class="Italic">Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 925. Regarding the FTCA, we have stated that we "approach[ &#8205;] the notice requirement leniently" and that it is "the information available in the notice supplied to the agency, and not the form in which it [is] presented, that [is] crucial." <span class="Italic">Santiago-Ram&#x00ED;rez v. SecSy of Depyt of Def</span>., 984 F.2d 16, 19, n.2 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Corte-Real v. United States</span>, 949 F.2d 484 (1st Cir. 1991)). In <span class="Italic">Santiago-Ram&#x00ED;rez</span>, we found that a letter that did not explicitly state a cause of action nevertheless satisfied the exhaustion requirement because it provided sufficient factual information about the incident, the identities of parties involved, and the injury "to allow the agency to investigate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20; <span class="Italic">see also Ram&#x00ED;rez-Carlo v. United States</span>, 496 F.3d 41, 46-47 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States</span>, 221 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2000)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, when examining exhaustion under Title VII, we have specified that the critical question is whether the claims "come within the 'scope of the EEOC investigation which can reasonably be expected to grow out of the charge of discrimination.'" <span class="Italic">Powers v. Grinnell Corp</span>., 915 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">S&#x00E1;nchez v. Standard Brands, Inc</span>., 431 F.2d 455, 466 (5th Cir. 1970)). In this context, we have stated that "the exact wording of the charge of discrimination need not presage with literary exactitude the judicial pleadings which may follow." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Tipler v. E.I. duPont deNemours &#x0026; Co</span>., 443 F.2d 125, 131 (6th Cir. 1971)) (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr</span>., 221 F.3d 254, 263 (1st Cir. 2000) ("Though the administrative complaint does not spell out all of the specific [incidents], it was sufficient to describe the essential nature of the charge and to lead to a reasonable investigation thereof.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While not consistently, the MSPB has previously applied less stringent formulations of the WPA's exhaustion requirement. For instance, in <span id="Page_3869"></span><span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, No. CH-1221-14-0721-W-1, 2016 WL 685076 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 18, 2016), it held that the appellant had exhausted a perceived whistleblower allegation because he "stated in his OSC complaint that he was 'called on the carpet' by the VAMC Assistant Director after he wrote the letter to the head of the agency." And in the context of determining the degree of specificity required to exhaust a particular "category of wrongdoing," it stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because the [WPA] is remedial legislation, the [MSPB] will construe its provisions liberally to embrace all cases fairly within its scope.... The key to determining whether an appellant has satisfied the exhaustion requirement in an IRA appeal is whether he provided OSC with a <span class="Italic">sufficient basis</span> to pursue an investigation, not whether he correctly labeled the category of wrongdoing; OSC can be expected to know which category of wrongdoing might be implicated by a particular set of factual allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pasley v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 105, 111-12 (2008) (emphasis added). These are in line with our holding today that it is unnecessary for an employee to correctly label the cause of action or legal theory behind his claim for it to be deemed exhausted before the OSC, as long as he or she provides a "sufficient [factual] basis" for the MSPB to pursue an investigation regarding that particular claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 112.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mount's OSC complaint did not expressly mention a "perceived assistance claim" or state that his supervisors "perceived" Mount to have engaged in protected activity, his allegations can be construed as such, as they support the core element of a perceived whistleblower claim: "that agency officials appeared to believe that [he] engaged...in whistleblowing activity." <span class="Italic">King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. at 695. Importantly, Mount repeatedly alleged that his supervisors took actions "to retaliate against [him] for providing information to SA Hickey that was used during his OSC whistleblower complaint/investigation against HSI Boston management officials." Numerous other allegations in the complaint support this view. For example, Mount alleged that Kurtz told him that: (1) the "'Front Office'...was not happy about the email" and (2) he had informed those supervisors that "it was...Mount's decision to give the email to SA Hickey." Moreover, the complaint recounts a later May 2015 meeting in which Shea, a supervisor, told Mount that he was disappointed in him and accused him of lying, while Mount attempted to disabuse Shea of the notion that delivering the email was his own idea. Additionally, the complaint relates that in August 2015, Mount "was informed he was being investigated for unauthorized release of information (giving the email to SA Hickey) and lack of candor (allegedly not expressly telling DSAC Shea he had read the email...)"; and that in September 2015, a supervisor told Mount that he did not interview him for an open position for which Mount had applied "because of the whole lying and Brendan Hickey email thing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we could continue parading examples, we need not go any further. Together, the above statements imply that Mount's supervisors had at least a perception that Mount engaged in protected activity, in this case providing information to SA Hickey to help him in his whistleblower case. Consequently, we find that Mount's original OSC complaint provided a sufficient factual basis to put OSC on notice of a potential perceived assistance claim. <span class="Italic">See Delgado</span>, 880 F.3d at 927 (holding that appellant satisfied the WPA's exhaustion requirement "by presenting the OSC with sufficient information to permit a legally sophisticated reader to understand his charge of retaliation and to investigate it further").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to allegations suggesting violations of law or regulations, <span class="Italic">Mason v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 135, 143 &#x00B6; 17, 2011 MSPB 39 (2011), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant is not required to identify the particular statutory or regulatory provision that the agency allegedly violated when his statements and circumstances of those statements clearly implicate an identifiable law, rule, or regulation. Rather, at the jurisdictional stage, he is only burdened with nonfrivolously alleging that he reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced a violation of one of the circumstances described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Baldwin</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 12. The proper test for determining whether an employee had a reasonable belief that his disclosures were protected is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee could reasonably conclude that the actions evidenced a violation of a law, rule, or regulation, or one of the other conditions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board is not bound by the label attached by OSC to an IRA complaint, as demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. DVA</span>, 88 MSPR 236, 242-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-25 (2001), involving a dispute over whether the appellant complained to OSC of reprisal for a prior complaint to OSC under 2302(b)(9)) or for a prior whistleblowing disclosure to OSC under 2302((b)(8)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 2302(b)(8) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant for employment because that person made a protected disclosure, while section 2302(b)(9) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant "because of the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." Sections 2302(b)(8) and (b)(9) therefore protect different activities<span class="Italic">. Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 46 MSPR 549, 553 (1991). As the Board's reviewing court has stated, the essential difference between the protections of sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9) is the difference between "reprisal based on disclosure of information and reprisal based upon exercising a right to complain." <span class="Italic">Serrao v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). The answer to the exhaustion question presented here therefore depends on whether the appellant's second complaint to OSC alleged reprisal based on the disclosure that he made in his first OSC complaint or reprisal based on having exercised the right to complain<span class="Italic">. See Shively v. Department of the Army,</span> 59 MSPR 531, 537 (1993). In addressing that question, the Board will look at what the appellant said in his submissions to OSC and how OSC treated those submis<span class="Italic">sions. See Finston v. Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 83 MSPR 100, 103-04 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his April 27, 1999 complaint, the appellant informed OSC that he was reporting that the agency failed to select him for "one of two positions under [JVA] 99-42 due to reprisal for having filed a previous report to OSC." In answer to question no. 13(a) on the OSC complaint form, the appellant checked a box indicating that he believed that the nonselection action was taken because he had disclosed information evidencing a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, and an abuse of authority. He stated that the disclosure for which the reprisal was taken occurred "last year." He claimed that the disclosure involved his nonselection for a position on the ground that he had not submitted a transcript "when the announcements did not require submission of transcripts."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a June 10, 1999 letter to the appellant in response to his April 27 complaint, the Special Counsel informed him that his "allegation has been analyzed as presenting a possible violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)." The letter explained the elements of proof necessary to establish a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) and stated that OSC's preliminary determination was to close its inquiry into the complaint because the appellant had not provided sufficient information to show a nexus between the agency decision not to select him for the two positions and his prior filing of an OSC complaint. Despite the fact that the appellant's complaint form indicated that he believed that the nonselection action was taken because he had made a protected disclosure, OSC's letter did not explain the basis for its decision to analyze the appellant's allegations only as a possible violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), and not as a possible violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded by sending a June 22, 1999 letter to OSC alleging that the nonselection was close in time to the filing of his first complaint, that an agency official who contacted one of his job references exhibited bias against him for having filed a complaint, that an agency official expressed animus toward him because he had filed the complaint, and that a comment purportedly made by an agency official and passed on to the appellant by a person who was selected to fill one of the vacancies indicated that the agency decided not to hire him because he "files complaints against management." The appellant also asserted that the agency did not want to hire someone who "delays work due to complaints, creates extra burdens due to complaints, etc."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a June 28, 1999 letter, OSC notified the appellant that it had reviewed his response and found no basis on which to reverse its preliminary determination. OSC summarized the appellant's complaint as an allegation that the agency did not hire him as a result of "reprisal for filing an OSC complaint." OSC's letter specifically states that it investigated the appellant's complaint as one in which he "alleged reprisal for filing an OSC complaint," and, as such, one in which he "alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)." It told the appellant that he had no appeal rights to the Board for allegations of a violation of section 2302(b)(9), and that such rights are "only available where an individual alleges a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)." OSC informed the appellant that he could seek reconsideration of the June 28 letter by filing a request with William Reukauf, the Associate Special Counsel for Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant sought reconsideration, claiming in an undated letter to Mr. Reukauf that the agency did not select him "because he filed a whistleblower report to OSC." He stated that "the facts of [his] situation clearly fall within 5 U.S.C. Section 2302(b)(8) as opposed to section 2302(b)(9)," and he requested that the Special Counsel provide him <span id="Page_3870"></span>with appeal rights to the Board. Mr. Reukauf's September 2, 1999 reply notified the appellant that because he had provided no additional evidence that would lead OSC to change its decision to close the file on his second complaint, he had no further appeal rights with the Special Counsel. The letter did not provide the appellant with Board appeal rights. Nonetheless, the appellant filed the instant IRA appeal within the statutory time limit for filing IRA appeals with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's second complaint to OSC framed his allegation as one in which he contended that the agency did not select him for either of the two Contract Specialist positions, grade levels GS-9 or GS-11, because he had previously filed a complaint with OSC. However, as noted above, in addition to his assertion of a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), he contended that the nonselection action was taken in retaliation for a protected disclosure that he had made the year before. He described that disclosure as being made to OSC and involving his disqualification for a position due to his failure to submit a transcript which was not required by the job announcement. He thus alleged a subsection (b)(8) violation concerning a matter that he had brought to the Special Counsel's attention in his first complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an individual is required to "seek corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board." This statutory exhaustion requirement is met where the complaining individual provides OSC with a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might have led to corrective action. <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1577. The individual must articulate with reasonable clarity and precision before OSC the basis for his request for corrective action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the sufficiency of a claim made to OSC of retaliation for whistleblowing is judged by statements made to OSC, not in later characterizations of the complaint made before the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nevertheless, an IRA appeal is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> action, and OSC's characterizations of the appellants allegations are not binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Singleton v. Ohio National Guard</span>, 77 MSPR 583, 586 (1998); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 55 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the record that the Special Counsel did not treat the appellant's second complaint as alleging a violation of section 2302(b)(8), nor did the Special Counsel investigate or analyze the complaint under that statutory provision. Rather, OSC consistently viewed the matters raised in the appellant's second complaint as raising only allegations of a violation of section 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his complaint form, the appellant articulated a violation of section 2302(b)(8) which he claimed had occurred within the year preceding the filing of his complaint. He briefly summarized the nature of his disclosure, saying that it involved his improper disqualification for a position because he did not submit transcripts which were not requested in the job announcement. He identified himself as the source of the alleged protected disclosure and stated that he had made the disclosure in a prior complaint filed with OSC. The record shows that the appellant filed his second OSC complaint only about seven months after he filed his first complaint, and approximately five months after OSC closed its file on the first complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's second complaint sets forth an allegation of retaliation for whistleblowing activity. Moreover, when OSC first informed the appellant of the difference between an alleged violation of subsection (b)(8) and subsection (b)(9) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, he replied that the allegations in his complaint raised a (b)(8) issue. Under these circumstances, we conclude that although the Special Counsel did not treat the appellant's second complaint as alleging a violation of section 2302(b)(8), the appellant had provided the Special Counsel with a sufficient basis on which to investigate a claim of both retaliation for filing a prior OSC complaint and retaliation for the protected disclosures made in the earlier complaint. <span class="Italic">Compare Serrao,</span> 95 F.3d at 1578 (the appellant did not sufficiently articulate a (b)(8) violation in his OSC complaint where he expressly sought corrective action from OSC solely for reprisal for the exercise of grievance rights, and merely included a statement in his OSC complaint that his supervisor believed him to be the anonymous source of an investigation that took place more than two years before the complaint was filed); <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit</span> <span class="Italic">Systems Protection Board,</span> 7 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the appellant did not establish the Board's jurisdiction over his IRA appeal where his complaint to OSC did not mention his disclosures to the IG). We therefore find that the appellant exhausted OSC proceedings with respect to the matters set forth in this IRA appeal and has established the Board's jurisdiction over it. <span class="Italic">See Manning v. Merit Systems</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Board,</span> 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (there is no need to hold a jurisdictional hearing where a jurisdictional issue can be resolved on the submissions of documentary evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the appellant need not label wrongdoing in the OSC complaint, the basis of the complaint must be clearly stated, <span class="Italic">Demery v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2282.Opinion.4-9-2020_1566792.pdf">809 Fed. Appx. 892</a>, 898 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an employee to establish that the Board has jurisdiction over an individual right of action appeal from OSC regarding a perceived whistleblower claim, he must, in addition to showing that he exhausted remedies before OSC, make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency perceived him as a whistleblower and that his perception as a whistleblower was a contributing factor to his non-selection. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3); <span class="Italic">King v. Dep't of Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, 696 (2011). Below, the Board found that Ms. Demery failed to raise this claim to OSC. We review the Board's legal conclusion that Ms. Demery failed to exhaust her administrative remedies <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Demery did not allege to OSC any perceived whistleblower theory separate from her whistleblower theory. Rather, her contention on appeal essentially is that raising a whistleblower theory also includes a perceived whistleblower theory. We disagree and see no error in the Board's ruling that Ms. Demery failed to exhaust her perceived whistleblower claim before OSC. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[T]he employee must inform [OSC] of the precise ground of his charge of whistleblowing.").</p>
