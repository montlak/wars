<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-83"><span class="space">a.</span> Overtime for Postal Service Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Service calculations for overtime are complicated by arrangements developed through its several national collective bargaining contracts and as a result of agency practices that are well-established in that organization. Also impacting USPS pay practices are system-wide regulations in the Employee and Labor Relations Manual ("ELM"). The agency is given some discretion: the Board will not nullify the method of overtime calculation employed by the agency in calculating a back pay award without a showing that the method was unreasonable or unworkable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ball v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 364, 367 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2002) (considering earnings of employees on an "overtime desired list"; although the overtime calculation method was to be one very likely to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, the Board will not nullify the agency's method of calculation of a back pay award unless it is shown that the method was unreasonable or unworkable), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ball v. USPS</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 910 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 22, 24 (1999) (same holding; the appellant failed to demonstrate that employees whose overtime records were being considered had to be on the "overtime desired list").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 232, 237 (1994), involving a mail handler, explained Postal Service overtime analysis for back pay calculations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is entitled to any overtime he would have earned during a period of erroneous removal. <span class="Italic">See Deckert v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 11, 12 (1985). Under the Back Pay Act, overtime may be computed based on either the employee's prior overtime assignments or on the overtime worked by similarly situated employees during the period of wrongful removal. <span class="Italic">See O'Reilly v. Department of Transportation,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 405, 409 (1985). In addition, the Board has held that it will not nullify the method employed by the agency in calculating a back pay award in the absence of a showing that the method was unreasonable or unworkable. <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 219, 226 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency calculated that the appellant worked an average of 44 hours of overtime per year based on the appellant's prior overtime assignments from 1981 through 1983. The appellant argued that the agency should have calculated his overtime based on the average of 29.9 hours of overtime per pay period worked by an employee in a similar position in a different shift. The agency responded that this employee was not similarly situated because she was on the overtime desired list as required by the agency's regulations as well as the collective bargaining agreement. In addition, the agency submitted evidence that, to receive significant overtime assignments, employees must place their names on the overtime desired list. The employee the appellant seeks to be compared to for overtime purposes was on such a list; the appellant never took this action during his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Broadnax</span> and <span class="Italic">O'Reilly</span>, the administrative judge found that the method used by the agency to calculate the appellant's overtime was reasonable. The administrative judge considered the agency's calculations based on the previous overtime record of the appellant. He also considered that, because the appellant was not on the overtime desired list, it was unclear that he even would have worked a significant amount of overtime. The administrative judge further considered that the comparison employee used by the appellant worked excessive overtime because, as explained by the agency, her shift was the busiest. We find that the administrative judge fully considered the relevant issues <span id="Page_4879"></span>and correctly concluded that the method utilized by the agency for determining the appellant's overtime entitlement was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the administrative judge's Recommendation, the agency had not paid the appellant for the 44 hours of overtime. However, the agency submitted evidence that it has now issued a check to the appellant for the appropriate amount of overtime pay. Accordingly, we find the agency has complied with the Board's order on this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board applied <span class="Italic">Cavanagh</span> in <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 660, 665-66 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant is a preference eligible veteran, his back pay award under the settlement agreement is governed by the Back Pay Act and includes the amount of overtime pay he would have received if the agency had not removed him. <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 232, 237 (1994). Overtime back pay may be computed based on either the employee's pre-removal overtime assignments or the overtime worked by similarly situated employees during the back pay period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The method chosen must be the one most likely to restore the employee to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. Lavelle v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 86, 90 (1988). The Board will not nullify the method employed by the agency in calculating a back pay award in the absence of a showing that the method was unreasonable or unworkable. <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. United States Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 219, 226 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the amount of overtime back pay should be computed based on the appellant's pre-removal history, and that he should receive no overtime back pay because he worked no overtime during the ten pay periods immediately preceding his removal. The administrative judge found that the agency submitted no evidence in support of this claim. The administrative judge was mistaken. The agency submitted the appellant's payroll records which reflect that the appellant did not work any overtime during the ten pay periods prior to his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he is entitled to overtime back pay because all employees are eligible to work overtime. However, he does not claim that he regularly worked overtime hours that were made available to him or that the ten pay periods cited by the agency otherwise inaccurately reflect his pre-removal overtime history. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's pre-removal overtime history is a reasonable method to calculate the overtime back pay due the appellant and that the agency has shown that no overtime back pay is due.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ball v. USPS</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 910, 911-912 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP), accepted the Board's approach to overtime calculation and, in particular, overtime calculation for Postal Service employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition to this court, Ball argues that the Board used an employee that was not similarly situated to him because this employee placed himself only on two of the three available "overtime desired" lists ("ODLs")--the lists the Postal Service uses to assign overtime. Thus, he argues, the Board should have either adopted his (and the AJ's) suggested list of similarly situated employees or applied an "opportunity missed" calculation, paying him for all overtime hours he could have worked had he not been removed. For the reasons articulated below, we must reject both arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we decline to require an "opportunity missed" methodology for calculating overtime back pay. The Board has already rejected such an approach, and we think rightfully so. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 651, 656 n.3 (1987) ("[w]e reject outright the appellant's argument that since...he would have worked all of the hours available to him, he should have been paid for [them]."). An "opportunity missed" method is not an accurate measure of the overtime an employee would have worked. This method would frequently overstate the amount of overtime that an employee would have worked because virtually no employee takes advantage of every overtime opportunity. As such, it is a less accurate method than either using the employee's past record of overtime or the record of overtime of similarly situated employees because both of these measures reflect actual experiences. We therefore decline to reverse the Board for failing to use an "opportunity missed" method for calculating overtime back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we find that the Board's use of Mr. Winston as a "similarly situated" employee was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. To determine whether comparison employees are situated similarly the agency may consider the skill level, shift worked, and position held. <span class="Italic">Tippets v. United States Postal</span> Serv., 82 M.S.P.R. 497, 501-02 (1999). Here, the agency used Winston because he was of similar seniority, had the same days off ("drop days"), and took similar advantage of overtime opportunities as had Petitioner in his last pay periods. Seniority is a pertinent factor because overtime is often granted on this basis, with senior employees getting priority. "Drop days" are important because an employee's schedule plays a large role in whether or not he works overtime. While it is true that Winston had his name on only two of the three possible ODLs and that ODLs are an important factor in calculating overtime, we still find that the agency's use of Winston as a similarly situated employee was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. Winston worked 1,318.50 hours of overtime during the 55 pay periods, whereas in the last 55 periods before his removal, Ball worked 1,260.33 hours of overtime. In addition, the three persons recommended by the AJ all had different "drop days" and were of lower seniority than Petitioner and were therefore appropriately rejected by the agency and the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to permit an agency to calculate overtime based on periods that the agency had involuntarily idled the appellant by placing him on administrative leave or LWOP status. The determination of back pay for overtime is retrospective. It was improper to base an overtime back pay award on the employee's overtime worked after reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Gay v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 219, 230 n.2 (1991). The agency cannot plausibly maintain that the appellant would not earn overtime because he was not on an overtime list if his failure to appear on the list was the result of his improper removal. <span class="Italic">Dwyer v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 181, 185-86 (1987) (appellant was not on the "overtime desired list" because he was removed from his job; the wrongfully removed employee is entitled to the overtime he would have earned during the period of the erroneous removal, even though the overtime was not actually scheduled); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Marcy v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3308) (placement on "overtime desired" list was insufficient, without proof of the treatment of comparably-situated workers, to demonstrate actual overtime entitlement during period covered by back pay settlement); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 22, 24 (1999) (appellant failed to demonstrate that employees whose overtime records were considered were required to be on "overtime desired list"); <span class="Italic">Vidal v. USPS</span>, 84 MSPR 395, 400-01 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (had appellant not been removed, he would have been converted to full-time regular status and been offered placement on the "overtime desired list" (ODL); that choice was lost because of the wrongful removal: "The agency should not be permitted to improperly deny the appellant a choice, and then use his failure to choose as the basis for denying him overtime under the Back Pay Act."); <span class="Italic">Keenan v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 497, 500 (1996) ("The fact that the comparison employees may have been unavailable to work some hours because they were on annual leave should not be held against the appellant, whose availability should similarly be measured by taking note of his use of annual leave.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Particular types of Postal Service overtime arrangements were considered in: <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 931 F.2d 1540, 1541 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (affirming denial by MSPB of an "out of schedule" overtime for an employee assigned to a regular schedule during demotion set aside as improper); <span class="Italic">Samuels v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 30, 33 n.1 (2003) (defining out of schedule pay as a form of premium pay if the employee works outside of his regularly scheduled hours on a temporary schedule at the request of management); <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 97, 100 (1997) ("out of schedule" pay was denied when it was not required by a negotiated agreement because the appellant was not in the bargaining unit, nor was it required by postal regulations); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 303, 306 (1996) (discussing availability and computation of "penalty overtime back pay").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Postal Service labor relations manual (ELM or LRM) may apply to overtime calculations. <span class="Italic">Boyer v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 257, 259-60 (1991), interpreted the overtime provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party has provided any evidence specifically showing the intended meaning of the term "employment status" in LRM &#x00A7; 436.411(a). In the absence of direct evidence, we look to the other sections in the same area of the LRM to define the term and to determine how to calculate the amount of back overtime pay the appellant is entitled to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">LRM &#x00A7; 436.11 provides that back pay should include allowances, differentials, and employment benefits which the employee normally would have earned. Reading that section together with LRM &#x00A7; 436.411(a), and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, we find that the reference to employees with "the same employment status" means those employees whose work patterns during the back pay period would most clearly resemble what the appellant would have experienced....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 584, 588 (1997) (ELM: the agency failed to apply the overtime provision properly when it did not compute the average of comparable employees for the entire pay period).</p>
