<p class="noindent">Reviewing an arbitration award, and setting it aside for lack of proper analysis, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;IS and AFGE Council 119</span>, 68 FLRA 272, 274-75 (2015) (following remand, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;IS and AFGE Council 119, </span>69 FLRA 512 (2016)), synthesized decisions concerning disclosure of names of award recipients:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Privacy Act generally forbids the release of information records stored in a "system of records"--i.e., a system that allows information to be retrieved by name;[15] however, the Privacy Act is subject to FOIA.[16] FOIA broadly requires the disclosure of government records, but contains an exemption (Exemption 6) for "personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy."[17] To determine whether disclosure "would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,"[18] the Authority balances the public interest in disclosure against the employee privacy interests at stake.[19] The only relevant public interest in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens as to the activities of their government.[20]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(4-5), (b); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, N.Y. TRACON, Westbury, N.Y</span>., 50 FLRA 338, 341 (1995) (<span class="Italic">TRACON</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(2); <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 341.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[19] <span class="Italic">E.g., TRACON</span>, 50 FLRA at 345 (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Jackson, Miss</span>., 32 FLRA 133, 138 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 343 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD v. FLRA</span>, 510 U.S. 487, 495-96 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that performance-award information is contained in a system of records.[21] However, the Authority has held that there is a public interest in: (1) ensuring that the appraisal and awards systems are administered in a fair and equitable manner, without discrimination, and in accordance with laws, rules, and regulations and (2) monitoring the public fisc to ensure that the agency's expenditure of money for awards is appropriate.[22] Thus, the Authority has held that the Privacy Act does not categorically forbid the disclosure of the names of award recipients; however, "where the disclosure of award recipients' names would necessarily reveal those recipients' performance ratings, the Privacy Act bars disclosure of their names."[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that "there would be no 'unwarranted invasion,' since providing information would permit the parties to discuss and negotiate." However, this reasoning is contrary to Authority and U.S. Supreme Court precedent.[25] Rather, under FOIA Exemption 6, "the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens as to the activities of their [g]overnment."[26] In particular, "the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute, [are not] considered in [the Authority's] analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA."[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator made no factual findings as to whether it would be possible to determine employee performance ratings based on the award data--i.e., whether there is a privacy interest in the nondisclosure of recipients' names. Nor did the Arbitrator address how the inclusion of the names of award recipients would add to the public interest in disclosure of the information.[28]...</p>

<p class="noindent">In the context of resolution of exceptions to an arbitrator's award, the Privacy Act did not bar fulfillment of a contract obligation that the agency produce information to the union that would reveal the names of award recipients, <span class="Italic">Dept.</span> <span class="Italic">of</span> <span class="Italic">Energy, Nat'l Energy Tech. Lab. and AFGE Local 1916,</span> 64 FLRA 1174, 1176 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, the Privacy Act does not bar disclosure of award recipients' names. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, New Eng. Region, Bradley Air Traffic Control Tower, Windsor Locks, Conn.</span>, 51 FLRA 1054, 1064-66 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Bradley</span>). However, the Authority has held that where the disclosure of award recipients' names would necessarily reveal those recipients' performance ratings, the Privacy Act bars disclosure of their names. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., N.Y. Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>52 FLRA 1133, 1142 (1997); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 375th Mission Support Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.</span>, 51 FLRA 599, 605-06 (1995). Nevertheless, an employer does not violate the Privacy Act by disclosing information that is already public knowledge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Barry v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 63 F. Supp.2d 25, 27-28 (D.D.C. 1999) (<span class="Italic">Barry</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement entitled the Union to the names of award recipients. As discussed above, the Privacy Act does not prohibit disclosure of that information. <span class="Italic">See Bradley</span>, 51 FLRA at 1064-66. Although the Arbitrator found that disclosure of name-identified awards information would "likely" result in revealing individual employees' performance ratings, the disclosure itself would not cause such a result. Rather, the Agency contends, and there is no dispute, that it is "common knowledge" that only employees who have been rated as significantly exceeding expectations received a performance award during the year at issue. As this information is already public knowledge, the disclosure of award recipients' names would not violate the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">See Barry</span>, 63 F. Supp.2d at 27-28. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA New England Region and NATCA</span>, 51 FLRA 1054, 1063-69 (1996), required release of information identifying the recipients of awards when disclosure of that information would not disclose levels of performance ratings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requested performance award data consists of awards given under the Performance Management Recognition System (PMRS) and the Performance Management System (PMS), quality within-grade increases, special achievement awards, and letters of commendation. Information pertaining to performance-based actions (such as awards, pay increases, and bonuses) and notices of commendation is contained in the OPM/GOVT-2 system of records<span class="Italic">. See</span> 55 Fed. Reg. 35709-10 (1992). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also U.S. Department of the Air Force, 375th Mission Support Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 51 FLRA 599, 604 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB);</span> <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 63. We find that it is proper to take official notice of that fact in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has found that employees have a privacy interest in performance award data because performance award documents may contain favorable information that employees may wish to keep confidential and which, if disclosed, could: (1) subject employees to embarrassment and jealousy among co-workers; and (2) result in discord at the workplace. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Center, Louisville Office, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 45 FLRA 1346, 1353 (1992). Employees who did not receive awards also may have a privacy interest in the release of performance award data because disclosure of that data could reveal information that could subject those employees to embarrassment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Authority has recognized that disclosure of information relating to performance awards would serve the public interests of: (1) ensuring that the appraisal and awards systems are administered in a fair and equitable manner, without discrimination, and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations and (2) monitoring the public fisc to ensure that the agency's expenditure of money for awards is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 606-07. The Authority has noted that the public interest in award information has been recognized in a Government-wide regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311(a)(4), which includes name-identified award data among the categories of information available to the public, so long as the award information is not disclosed in a manner that would reveal an individual's performance appraisal<span class="Italic">. See Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 607; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 64.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where name-identified performance award data would reveal information about an employee's performance rating and the inclusion of the names of award recipients would not add to the public interest, the Authority has found that employee privacy interests' outweigh the public interest in disclosure. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 606-07; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 64. In these cases, the Authority concluded that the release of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 607; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 64.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, there is no evidence in this case that disclosure of the requested awards information would reveal an employee's specific performance rating or other information in performance award records that employees wish to keep confidential. As a result, the weighty privacy interest, which tipped the balance against disclosure in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, is significantly reduced in the case before us. In contrast, the regulatorily recognized public interest in disclosure remains undiminished.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, on balance, the employee's personal privacy interests in this performance award data do not outweigh the public interest that its disclosure would serve. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested performance award data would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of the FOIA Exemption 6. Consequently, based on the foregoing, we conclude that disclosure of the requested information of nonbargaining unit employees is not barred by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Performance Award Data Is "Necessary" Within</span> <span class="Italic">the Meaning of Section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have determined that the requested performance award data is not prohibited from disclosure by law.&#x2003;We also find that this information is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to the Judge's decision, the Authority issued <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>), which set forth the analytic approach to be used in determining whether information is "necessary" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We held that a union requesting information under that section must establish a particularized need for the information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. We also stated that a union's need will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must demonstrate that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members'" 50 FLRA at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)). The union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute. As for the agency's responsibilities, we stated that when it denies an information request, the agency must assert and establish any countervailing anti-disclosure interests. The agency will not satisfy its burden by making conclusory or bare assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, the record shows that the Union initially requested name-identified performance award information in order to prepare for annual labor-management meetings, which would include discussions of the Agency's recognition and awards program, and to determine whether unit employees had been treated differently under the program. At the hearing, the Union President further explained the Union's previously stated reasons for the request by testifying that he needed the information to engage in discussions with management officials and for comparison purposes, to determine whether bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees were being recognized in the same manner for the same performance. He also stated that the performance award data was needed in an unsanitized form so the Union could associate the employee's performance (as observed by the Union) with the award and determine whether there had been favoritism shown toward non-bargaining unit employees. According to the Union President, during the 2 years preceding the request, the Union received numerous complaints from bargaining unit employees that a disproportionate number of exceptional and outstanding awards were given to non-bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the Union has established a particularized need for the name-identified awards information. The record supports the Judge's findings that there are a small number of employees at the facility and, of them, 16 non-bargaining unit employees <span id="Page_372"></span>perform traffic control work similar to bargaining unit employees. The record also supports the Judge's conclusions that unsanitized performance award data concerning the non-bargaining employees was necessary because without it, the Union could not relate the award data to what the Union knows that specific non-bargaining employees have done with regard to on-the-job training, flight assists, and operational errors. We agree with the Judge that without name-identified award information the Union would not be able to assess the relationship between awards and performance based on its independent knowledge of what bargaining unit and non-bargaining unit employees do. That is, without the information, the Union could not determine the merit of bargaining unit employees' complaints concerning disproportionate treatment under the awards and recognition program and, as the Judge found, assess a potential grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does not assert any specific anti-disclosure interests. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 672. Instead, the Respondent argues that data about non-bargaining unit commendations and awards is not necessary or relevant for comparison purposes because it concerns employees in dissimilar positions. We interpret the Respondent's argument as a claim that the data is not relevant to prove disparate treatment and, therefore, not necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4). As explained above, we have already rejected this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union has established a particularized need for the information.&#x2003;The Respondent has not asserted any anti-disclosure interests in the information. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the names of non-bargaining unit employees and the letters of commendation and monetary performance awards given those employees is necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. Consequently, based on the record before us, we conclude that the Respondent failed to comply with the requirements of section 7114(b)(4) and, thereby, violated section 7116(a)(1), (5) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, New York Region and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 52 FLRA 1133, 1139-49 (1997), ascertained no Privacy Act bar to release of information concerning employees who received performance awards and special act or service awards, but the union did not demonstrate a particularized need for the information under the <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City</span> test. The union failed to articulate a need for the information, the uses for the information, and the connection between those uses and the union's statutory responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of Privacy Act restrictions, management was not required to disclose lists of employees who did and did not receive awards, <span class="Italic">SSA, San Francisco Bay Area and AFGE Local 3172</span>, 51 FLRA 58, 62-65 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 of the FOIA and, therefore, that disclosure of the information is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Accordingly, without addressing whether the information is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4), we conclude that the Respondent did not violate the Statute by refusing to provide the information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>), which involved the disclosure of performance appraisals of bargaining unit employees, we set forth an analytical approach we will follow in assessing an agency's claim that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6 and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. We stated that an agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure is required to demonstrate: (1) that the information requested is contained in a "system of records" within the meaning of the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how disclosure of the requested information will serve that public interest. Although the parties bear the burdens, we will, where appropriate, consider matters that are otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, for reasons more fully explained there, that the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens as to the activities of the Government. More particularly, we held that the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute, will no longer be considered in our analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the relevant interests are established, we will balance the privacy interests of employees against the public interest in disclosure. Where this balance leads us to conclude that the privacy interests are greater than the public interest at stake, we will find that the requested disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 and, therefore, that disclosure is "prohibited by law" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute; accordingly, the agency is not required to furnish the information unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act. In contrast, where the balance tips the other way because the public interest is greater than the privacy interests, we will conclude that disclosure would be required under the FOIA and, therefore, is not prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this analytical framework, we note that the Respondent does not address whether the information is contained in a system of records. However, as we did in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> with respect to performance appraisals, 50 FLRA at 346, we find that it is proper to take official notice of the fact that material pertaining to employee awards is contained in a system of records. <span class="Italic">See</span> 55 Fed. Reg. 3843 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has found, and the Respondent has established here, that employees have significant privacy interests in their performance appraisals because performance appraisals contain extremely personal information that employees may wish to keep confidential. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 347. Unquestionably, such privacy interests extend to employees' final ratings. In addition, the Authority has determined that disclosure of favorable, as well as unfavorable, information could subject employees to embarrassment and jealousy among co-workers, which could result in discord at the workplace. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs</span>, 50 FLRA 472, 479-80 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Office of Justice Programs</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Jacksonville Air Traffic Control Tower, Jacksonville, Florida</span>, 50 FLRA 388 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the requested information encompasses two lists of employees' names: (1) those whose performance was rated excellent or higher who received awards; and (2) those whose performance was rated excellent or higher and who did not receive awards. These lists inherently would identify all employees who were rated excellent or higher. The lists also would reveal, by omission, rating information of all other employees. That is, it is obvious that an employee whose name did not appear on either list would have received a rating lower than excellent. <span class="Italic">See Office of Justice Programs</span>, 50 FLRA at 479-80. For the reasons more fully discussed in FAA, and the other cited decisions, we find that employees have substantial privacy interests in maintaining the confidentiality of information regarding their performance appraisals, including their final performance rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we find no evidence in the record to establish that disclosure of the requested information would more than minimally, if at all, serve the public interest, because the two lists of employees would reveal little about the Government's operations. <span class="Italic">See Office of Justice Programs</span>, 50 FLRA at 480-81. The General Counsel asserts that disclosure of the requested information would serve the public interest in promoting the fair and equitable treatment of Federal employees and the application of merit principles and in preventing illegal discrimination. We agree with the General Counsel that disclosure of information that would permit review of an agency's award system to ensure that it is administered in a fair and equitable manner, without discrimination, and in accordance with laws, rules and regulations, would shed light on Government operations and allow the public to monitor the agency's expenditure of funds allocated for awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the General Counsel has not established how disclosure of the requested lists would serve that public interest.[7] The General Counsel has not shown how the names of award recipients and nonrecipients, who have received ratings of excellent or higher, would enable a member of the public to assess whether or not the Respondent has administered its awards program fairly and in a fiscally sound manner. Although disclosure of the requested information likely would enhance the Union's ability to fulfill its representational responsibilities, it is clear that this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6.[8] <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989) ("[T]he identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request."). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1014 ("[A]ll FOIA requesters have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7] In general, the public interest in awards information is recognized in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311, which permits public access to certain enumerated information about present and former Federal employees, including "[p]resent and past annual salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious or Distinguished Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials)[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311(a)(4). However, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.311(b)(1), an agency may not disclose information if its disclosure "would reveal more about the employee on whom information is sought than the six enumerated items, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]" In this case, disclosure of the requested lists <span id="Page_373"></span>would reveal information regarding each employee's performance rating and, we conclude, would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of the employees' privacy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8] As we also stated in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, a union's commitment not to disclose information is no longer relevant in balancing the respective interests. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 346, n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest that would be served by disclosure is outweighed by the substantial invasion of employees' privacy that would result. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6 and, thus, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Therefore, the Respondent was not obligated to provide the Union with the information under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute and its failure to do so did not violate the Statute.</p>
