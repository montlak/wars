<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-64"><span class="space">a.</span> Excepted Service Employees Excluded From Due Process Amendments; Statutory Appointment Discretion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Civil Service Due Process Amendments extend appeal rights to a class of excepted service employees broader than preference eligibles. The legislative history of the Due Process Amendments, found in H.R. Rep. 101-328, 1990 USCCAN 695, makes plain the remedial nature of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Permitting veterans in excepted service positions to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board when they face adverse actions has not crippled the ability of agencies excepted from the competitive service to function. Therefore, the Committee sees no problem with extending these procedural protections to certain other employees in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Committee also noted exclusions from coverage for excepted service employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The bill limits the procedural protections for employees of the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the National Security Agency solely to preference eligibles, thereby preserving the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. The Committee preserved the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> in relation to the FBI and NSA because of their sensitive missions. Nonbargaining unit employees of the Postal Service were given due process appeal rights through Public Law 100-90. Employees at the Tennessee Valley Authority already have a negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As the legislative history suggests, the amendments to the Civil Service Due Process Act incorporated into the Reform Act exclusions of some groups of employees from statutory due process and appeal rights. The excluded employees are identified at 5 USC 7511. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-048.html#sec1-49">Employees Who May Appeal; Appealable Issues</a>"] .</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations implementing the Reform Act sought to exclude from due process and appellate protections employees covered under statutes specifically denying employees those rights. The OPM regulation, 5 CFR 752.401(d) (2022), provides that coverage of adverse action procedures is not available to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(12)&#x2003;An employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM provided guidance in a Federal Register notice of final rulemaking that accompanied 5 CFR 752.401(d), on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13191). The position of OPM is summarized by explaining that individuals appointed under statutes other than Title 5 are included within the excepted service unless the appointing statutes specifically include them in Title 5. According to the OPM notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Discussion with agencies has suggested to OPM that some minor changes would clarify the meaning of &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) pertaining to these employees whose positions have been excluded by statute from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, and in some cases, other provisions as well. The problem with trying to characterize the groups of positions that are excluded by statute from the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, but not specified in the DPA exclusions, is that Congress has used variable language to describe these exclusions, ranging from exceptions to the appointing requirements of the competitive service to exclusions from all provisions of title 5. The most commonly used language, however, provides appointing authority for the agency head "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service" or in some cases "without regard to the civil-service laws." Under long-established legal interpretations (currently set out in FPM Chapter 212, Framework of the Federal Civilian Service), "the authority to separate, suspend, or furlough an employee or to reduce the employee's grade or pay is inherent in the power to appoint." In other words, when agencies have the power to appoint without regard to the usual competitive or civil service laws, including veterans' preference, this broad authority carries with it the authority to remove (and take adverse actions) without regard to those same laws. In most of these statutory provisions, there is no specific exclusion from the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code. Therefore, we are making clarifying changes to &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) to indicate that all that is required for a statutory exclusion from chapter 75 is a legislative exclusion from the appointing requirements of title 5, United States Code, in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expansively interpreted and applied, the OPM regulatory comment that employees would be excluded under the Due Process Amendments if their appointing statutes allowed appointments without regard to competitive requirements could disenfranchise many excepted service appointees who fell within the clear coverage of those amendments. The OPM interpretation was not broadly construed or applied. The Board and the Federal Circuit determined that the statutory exclusion must be specific.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Todd v. DOD</span>, 63 MSPR 4 (1994), the appellant, a paraprofessional with the Department of Defense Dependents Schools, appealed a change in her work schedule that resulted in reducing her pay. The statute supporting the appellant's appointment, 20 USC 241(a), provided that DOD school personnel may be employed under the following circumstances, including a specific exemption from 5 USC 7511 and 7512:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the purpose of providing such comparable education, personnel may be employed and the compensation, tenure, leave, hours of work, and other incidents of the employment relationship may be fixed without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and the following: (1) chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5; (2) subchapter I of chapter 63 of Title 5; (3) sections 5504, 5541 to 5549, and 6101 of title 5; (4) 1302 (b), (c), 2108, 3305(b), 3306(a)(2), 3308 to 3318, 3319(b), 3320, 3351, 3363, 3364, 3501 to 3504, 7511, 7512, and 7701 of title 5; and (5) chapter 43 of title 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of that language, <span class="Italic">Todd</span> determined, 63 MSPR at 9:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the legislative history of the Amendments indicates that teachers (including those employed by the DoD Dependents School) are excepted service employees to whom the procedural rights are extended, <span class="Italic">see</span> 1990 U.S. Code Cong. and Adm. News at 697-98, that statement is consistent with 20 USC 241 because section 241 make it permissible, but not mandatory, for DoD dependent school employees to be given appeal rights under 5 USC 7701. However, the appellant was not given those rights under the terms of her appointment, and thus under section 241 has no appeal rights to the Board. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board. <span class="Italic">Todd v. MSPB</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Under the Due Process Amendments, the court agreed that Todd could appeal a &#x00A7; 7512 adverse action but for the limitation on her appeal rights found in &#x00A7; 241(a). The court determined, however, that the Due Process Amendments did not trump the express imitations of &#x00A7; 241(a), 55 F.3d at 1577-78:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is apparent that there is no irreconcilability or repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel. This is a case of conflict between a specific statute which addresses a narrow category of activity and a generally applicable statute that covers a broad range of activity. Although Todd falls within the literal scope of both statutes, they are in conflict and only one can properly be applied to her. This conflict is properly resolved by applying the longstanding principle of statutory construction that "a statute dealing with a narrow, precise, and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum." <span class="Italic">Radzanower</span>, 426 U.S. at 153; <span class="Italic">Navy v.

In <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, the language was taken from statutory language quite common in appointment statutes stating that the agency "may appoint, without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service." That language only placed the appointee into the excepted service. The employee retained procedural protections and Board appeal rights conferred by the Due Process Amendments, 60 MSPR at 334-35:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that this provision [5 USC 7511(b)(2)(C)] excludes the Executive Director position from coverage under the Due Process Amendments because the appellant's appointment to the position of Executive Director was effected under 29 USC 783, which states, in relevant part, that the agency</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may appoint, without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing <span id="Page_70"></span>appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title relating to the classification and General Schedule pay rates, an Executive Director to assist the National Council to carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this appeal, the administrative judge relied on OPM's interpretation of the Due Process Amendments. In particular, the administrative judge found support for her decision in an OPM regulation, effective April 9, 1993, to be codified at 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12), stating that adverse action appeal rights were not afforded to</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee whose agency or position ha[d] been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 at 13,193 (Mar. 10, 1993). In comments on the new regulation that it published in the Federal Register, OPM stated that such employees were excluded from coverage "whether or not they [were] specifically listed as excluded in the [Due Process Amendments]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13,191.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM regulation applies, by its terms, to positions that have been excluded generally "from the appointing provisions of title 5." In its comment on the regulation, OPM stated that its new regulation was intended to clarify that "a legislative exclusion from the appointing requirements of title 5" was "<span class="Italic">required</span> for a statutory exclusion from chapter 75." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13,192 (emphasis added). However, 29 USC 783 provides only that the National Council may appoint an Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in <span class="Italic">the competitive service</span>" (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 29 USC 783 allows the agency to appoint an Executive Director without regard to title 5 provisions governing appointments in the competitive service, it does not exclude the appointment of the Executive Director from the appointing requirements of title 5 in general. Excluding a position from appointing requirements applicable to the competitive service, as was done by 29 USC 783, means only that the position is in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2103(a) ("the 'excepted service' consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service"). Indeed, many excepted service positions are covered by chapter 75 of title 5<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pennington v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 MSPR 8, 9-10 (1993). Thus, the OPM regulation relied on by the administrative judge does not support a finding that the appellant's position is excluded from coverage under the Due Process Amendments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388-89 (Fed. Cir. 1996), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The OPM contends that the statute that creates the Executive Director's position, 29 USC 783(a)(1), has the effect of excluding Briggs from the expansive definition of "employee" found in section 7511(a) because it allows the Council to appoint the Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions...of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates." Briggs contends, in response, that the OPM has not succeeded in refuting the Board's basic conclusion that the two sections alleged to conflict, 783(a)(1) and 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), are easily reconciled and plainly confer Board jurisdiction over Briggs' appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recently had occasion to address a similar question regarding the effect of the Due Process Amendments on the Board's jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Todd v. MSPB</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, like Briggs, fell within the definition of employee at section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1576 &#x0026; n.3. The statute under which Todd was hired, however, gave the agency the option to employ her "without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and the following:...(4) sections...7511, 7512, and 7701 of Title 5."[4] <span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1577 (quoting 20 USC 241(a)). We affirmed the Board's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over Todd's appeal, reasoning that "there is no repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In sum, we concluded that, due to the enactment of the Due Process Amendments, "Todd would now qualify to appeal a section 7512 adverse action but for the limitation on her appeal rights found in section 241(a)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Briggs suggests, quite correctly, that we should apply the analytic framework of Todd to determine her appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 7511 of title 5 defines the categories of federal employees that are eligible to appeal adverse actions to the Board; section 7512 defines appealable adverse actions; and section 7701 outlines the Board's appellate procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted above, section 783(a), the statute under which Briggs was hired, gives the Council the option to employ an Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions...of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates." Notably absent from the enumerated parts of title 5 that the Council may disregard in employing the Executive Director are those dealing with appeal rights in chapters 75 and 77, the very parts of title 5 from which Briggs has, according to the OPM, purportedly been excluded. As the text of section 783(a) makes plain, Congress gave the Council the option of disregarding only certain parts of title 5. To interpret the section as giving the Council the option to disregard additional, unenumerated parts of title 5 would run afoul of the maxim "<span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>," and in a domain where, as <span class="Italic">Todd</span> amply demonstrates, Congress knows how to exempt a civil service position from the protections found in chapters 75 and 77 of title 5 if it so desires.... We decline to construe the statute in this manner. Section 783(a) does not remove the Executive Director's position from the ambit of title 5's procedural protections for removal. The OPM's implementing regulation at 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12), to the extent that it calls for a result contrary to the plain meaning of section 783(a), has no force or effect in this case. <span class="Italic">See generally Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984) ("If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."). The Board thus has jurisdiction over Briggs' appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Briggs</span> was followed in an analogous appeal, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 364, 368-69 (1994), involving removal of a U.S. Trustee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not show, however, whether the appellant's position is excluded from coverage under the relevant part of chapter 75 by 5 USC 7511(b) or any other relevant authority. The only source of any such exclusion on which the agency appears to have relied is 5 USC 7511(b)(2), which excludes positions in the excepted service that have "been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character" by the appropriate official. If the position was excepted from the competitive service by the President, the determination described above must be made by the President; if it was excepted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the determination must be made by that agency; and, if it was excepted by statute, the determination must be made either by the President or by the head of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But another U.S. Trustee was exempt from civil service laws and beyond the Board's jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Stanley v. DOJ</span>, 423 F.3d 1271, 1273-74 (Fed. Cir. 2005), following a 1966 exclusionary order from the Attorney General (although <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> was not discussed by the Federal Circuit, reference to the initial decision in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> shows that the Attorney General's certification was not made prior to Thompson's appointment):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, it is undisputed that Attorney General Reno's Order in 1996 determined that the position of Trustee was of a "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character." This designation of the Trustee position is unreviewable by the courts because it is an "inherently discretionary judgment call" committed to the Attorney General. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't of Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988) (holding that the denial of security clearance is unreviewable by this court, in part, because it is an "inherently discretionary" decision). Thus, we must only determine whether United States Trustees are excepted from the competitive service by statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(2)(C) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 1986, section 581(c) stated that Trustees were "subject to removal for cause by the Attorney General" (emphasis added). In 1986, however, section 581(c) was amended and the "for cause" language was removed. <span class="Italic">See</span> Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-554, &#x00A7; 111(c), 100 Stat. 3088, 3091 (1986). The amended section now reads: "Each United States trustee is subject to removal by the Attorney General." Giving effect to section 581(c)'s plain language and its attendant legislative history, it is apparent that the Attorney General need not show cause before removing a Trustee. <span class="Italic">See Pierce County, Wash. v. Guillen,</span> 537 U.S. 129, 145 (2003) ("[W]hen Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume it intends its amendment to have real and substantial effect." (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone v. INS,</span> 514 U.S. 386, 397 (1995))). That Trustees may be removed without cause is a clear indication that they are excepted from the competitive service as required by section 7511(b)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (noting that employees in the competitive service may be removed only for cause).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances of appellants' employment also indicate that they occupied an excepted position. Their personnel forms specifically said that their appointments were excepted pursuant to section 581. And, both were appointed without a competitive examination, which is the "touchstone of the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Tenn. Valley Auth.,</span> 770 F.2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants also argue that because they served continuously as Trustees, they were excluded, much like those appointed prior to 1996, from the terms of Reno's order. While appellants did serve continuously, their initial terms ended; they continued in their positions pursuant to section 581(b)<span id="Page_71"></span>[5] merely as holdovers pending reappointment or the appointment of a successor. Once they accepted reappointment, they occupied no different position than any other individual appointed after Reno's order. Reno's proclamation designating the position of Trustee as confidential and policy-making applies to appellants with full force regardless of their previous status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Section 581(b) states that "Each United States trustee shall be appointed for a term of five years. On the expiration of his term, a United States trustee shall continue to perform the duties of his office until his successor is appointed and qualifies."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, appellants argue that section 581(b) prevents their removal prior to the expiration of their five-year terms. This is not the law, however, because inferior officers may be removed before the end of their statutorily defined term. <span class="Italic">See Parsons v. United States</span>, 167 U.S. 324, 339 (1897) ("[W]e must construe this act as providing absolutely for the expiration of the term of office at the end of four years, and not as giving a term that shall last, at all events, for that time...."); <span class="Italic">Pievsky v. Ridge</span>, 98 F.3d 730, 734 (3d Cir. 1996) ("It is a long-standing rule in the federal courts that a fixed term merely provides a time for the term to end."). Furthermore, reading section 581(b) as mandating a five-year term renders section 581(c) meaningless, a construction we will not adopt. <span class="Italic">See Food &#x0026; Drug Admin. v. Brown &#x0026; Williamson Tobacco Co</span>., 529 U.S. 120, 177 (2000) (holding that a statute should not be construed so as to invalidate other parts of the same statute); <span class="Italic">Pac Fung Feathers Co. v. United States</span>, 111 F.3d 114, 117 (Fed. Cir. 1997). If Congress had intended to eliminate the removal authority of the Attorney General during the course of the five-year term, it would have deleted section 581(c) in its entirety.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hamlett v. DOJ</span>, 90 MSPR 674, 675-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16 (2002), applied law developed under the Due Process Amendments to confer Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an Assistant United States Attorney, as to whom the Attorney General had, by statute, an arguable right to unreviewable appointment authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her excepted-service position[1] of Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) on charges of misconduct. The agency informed the appellant that she had the right to appeal to the Board, and she filed this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Leaving aside executive-level and certain specialized jobs that have no relevance here, we note that positions in the federal civil service are either "competitive" or "excepted"; the latter term refers to the fact that some positions are excepted from some laws, such as those governing competitive examinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102, 2103; <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued a show-cause order stating that the appellant may not have a right to appeal her removal to the Board because "[i]t appears that, under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542, the Attorney General may have 'unconditional authority' regarding the hiring and removal of [AUSAs]." In response to the order, both parties argued that section 542 does not affect the Board's jurisdiction under chapter 75 with respect to adverse action appeals filed by AUSAs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving the parties' submissions, the administrative judge concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because "the appointment and removal authority of an AUSA is under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542 and within the discretion of the Attorney General." The administrative judge certified an interlocutory appeal of his finding, stating that the issue has never been directly addressed by either the Board or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 542(a) of title 28 of the United States Code provides that the "Attorney General may appoint one or more [AUSAs] in any district when the public interest so requires." Section 542(b) states that "[e]ach [AUSA] is subject to removal by the Attorney General." Section 542 existed in some form as early as 1896, <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 542, Historical and Statutory Notes, and has been unchanged since 1966, when it was enacted as codified, Pub.

An individual who has been removed has Board appeal rights if, in addition to any other requirements, she meets the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our analysis with the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) of 1978. The CSRA established the Board and conferred on persons meeting the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) the right to appeal certain adverse actions to the Board. Pub. L. No. 95-454, title II, &#x00A7; 204(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1135. The original version of section 7511 authorized Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to provide for the application of the ch. 75 appeal-rights provision to "any position or group of positions excepted from the competitive service by [OPM] regulation." 92 Stat. 1136, currently codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(c).

II, does not apply to an individual: Whose appointment is made with the advice and consent of the Senate; whose position is in the excepted service pursuant to statute and has been determined by the President to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character; and whose position is in the excepted service pursuant to regulation and has been determined by OPM to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. 92 Stat. 1136, currently codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b), subsections (2)(B) &#x0026; (2)(C). None of these exclusions applies to AUSAs. Whereas U.S. Attorneys are subject to appointment with the advice and consent of the Senate, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 541(a), AUSAs are not, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542. Further, there is no indication that OPM has determined that the position of AUSA is a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating one for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and since the position of AUSA is not in the excepted service pursuant to statute, the President's power to exclude AUSAs on that ground does not apply, nor has the President purported to, exercise such power. There is also no indication that OPM has excluded AUSAs specifically from the application of ch. 75, subch. II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress expanded the coverage of section 7511 in 1990 to individuals in the excepted service generally,[4] it also extended the power to exclude confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating positions from section 7511 to the President for positions that the President has placed in the excepted service and to agency heads for positions placed in the excepted service by statute. 104 Stat. 462, currently codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b), subsections (2)(A) &#x0026; (2)(C). AUSA positions have not been placed in the excepted service by the President or by statute, so these new authorities allowing exclusion from coverage do not come into play (nor have they been purportedly exercised). In 1990, Congress also added 7 more categories of individuals to the exclusions from section 7511. Pub. L. No. 101-376, &#x00A7; 2(a). These exclusions cover employees whose positions would otherwise have fallen under the new provision granting adverse action appeal rights. For example, employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <span id="Page_72"></span>are in the excepted service, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 536, but the 1990 amendments expressly excluded FBI employees from the coverage of section 7511, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8). Notably absent from the classes of employees that Congress excluded from section 7511 in the 1990 amendments are those serving as AUSAs. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b), subsections (3)--(9). Under the axiom "<span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius,</span>" where a statute enumerates exceptions to a general rule, it is preferable not to interpret the statute as containing other, unenumerated exceptions. <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 585 &#x00B6; 9 (2001). This rule of statutory construction lends some support to the conclusion that AUSAs are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). Nonetheless, this does not end our inquiry, because if 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542 were to deprive AUSAs of adverse action appeal rights then there would be no need to list AUSAs under the exclusions to ch. 75 at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As noted above, preference-eligibles in the excepted service had appeal rights under the original version of the CSRA. 92 Stat. 1135 (currently codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To properly interpret 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542, we must consider an OPM regulation issued under ch. 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514 (authorizing OPM to promulgate regulations implementing subch. II of ch. 75). The regulation lists 12 classes of employees who do not have adverse action appeal rights, one of which is: "An employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12).[5] This regulation has been applied in two cases that have broad similarity to the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;AUSAs are not among the 11 other classes of employees mentioned in the regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d), subsections (1)-(11).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Todd v. Department of Defense</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 4 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995), an excepted-service employee of the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) who had been appointed pursuant to 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 241 sought to appeal an alleged reduction in pay. At the relevant time, section 241 authorized DoDDS to appoint personnel whose "compensation, tenure, leave, hours of work, and other incidents of the employment relationship may be fixed without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and...sections 7511, 7512, and 7701 of Title 5." The Board held, based on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), that the appellant was not covered by the 1990 amendments to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. 63 M.S.P.R. at 7-8. On review, the court affirmed this holding. The court stated that there was a clear "conflict" between a "specific" statute, 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 241, and the later-enacted "general" statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), and that under accepted principles of statutory construction, the general provisions of section 7511 did not "trump" the specific provisions of section 241. 55 F.3d at 1577-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 331 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 83 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the Executive Director of the National Council on Disability, who was appointed in the excepted service under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 783, sought to appeal her removal. Section 783 provided at the relevant time that the agency "may appoint, without regard to the provisions to Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions of chapter 541 and subchapter III of chapter 53 relating to the classification and General Schedule pay rates, an Executive Director to assist the National Council to carry out its duties." Relying on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), the Board concluded that the appellant was an "employee" covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). In support of this holding, the Board noted that section 783 excluded the appellant's position only from the competitive-service appointing provisions of Title 5, but did not exclude her position from the appointing provisions of Title 5 altogether as the plain language of OPM's regulation required. 60 M.S.P.R. at 334. In affirming the Board's decision, the court emphasized that section 783 listed specific provisions of Title 5 that the agency could "disregard" in employing an Executive Director, and sections 7511-7513 were absent from the list. 83 F.3d at 1388. According to the court, under the doctrine of "<span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio</span> <span class="Italic">alterius</span>," it would be incorrect to infer that there were additional unenumerated exceptions to the those specific exceptions listed in section 783 itself. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 542 does not bring AUSAs outside of the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), and that an AUSA who meets the plain terms of the latter provision has the right to appeal an adverse action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 to the Board. Section 542 is more like the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Briggs</span> than the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, insofar as section 542 does not exclude AUSAs from 5 U.S.C. ch. 75. Indeed, section 542 does not expressly exclude AUSAs from the appointing provisions of Title 5 as the plain terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) require, <span class="Italic">see Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 590, 593 (1994), nor does section 542 exclude AUSAs from any other provision of Title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus agree with <span class="Italic">United States v. Bridwell</span>, 583 F.2d 1135, 1140 (10th Cir. 1978), and <span class="Italic">Kenna v. United States Department of Justice</span>, 727 F. Supp. 64, 67 n.2 (D.N.H. 1989), which interpret section 542(a) as merely indicating which official may appoint an AUSA. We do not agree with the broad interpretation of section 542 set forth in <span class="Italic">Windsor v. United States Department of Justice</span>, 740 F.2d 6, 7 (6th Cir. 1984) (section 542 gives the Attorney General "unconditional" authority to dismiss an AUSA), and <span class="Italic">Windsor v. The Tennessean</span>, 719 F.2d 155, 159 (6th Cir. 1983) (AUSAs have "no protectible property or liberty interest in continued employment"). Those decisions were issued before the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments were enacted, and consequently, they did not consider, nor could they have considered, the scope of an AUSA's rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). To the extent that the Board may have indicated approval of the <span class="Italic">Windsor</span> decisions in <span class="Italic">Granger</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 492 n.*, and <span class="Italic">Leiser</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 550 n.*, that approval was misplaced and is hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the report of the committee that considered the bill which ultimately became the 1990 Due Process Amendments that casts doubt on our conclusion that AUSAs are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). In 1990 Congress excluded certain positions, individuals, and agencies from coverage under subch. II of ch. 75 either because another statute exempted those employees or their agencies from the Board appeals process, or because individuals encumbering those positions had the right to appeal adverse actions to a body other than the Board. H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, 101st Cong., 2d. Sess., at 5 (1990), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 4 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 695, 699. For example, and as the legislative history documents, "the National Security Act of 1946 provides the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with plenary authority to deal with personnel of the CIA," the "General Accounting Office [GAO] Personnel Act of 1980 provides comparable procedural rights for GAO employees through the GAO Personnel Appeals Board," and "employees at the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration are subject to a special peer review system." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The 1990 committee report further shows that Congress limited the protections afforded under subch. II of ch. 75 for employees of the National Security Agency and the FBI because of the "sensitive missions" of those employees, and that it limited the procedural protections of employees of the U.S. Postal Service and the Tennessee Valley Authority, because those employees had appeal rights under other statutes or through a negotiated grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> We find nothing in the committee report to show that Congress believed that AUSAs were responsible for a "sensitive mission," had adverse action appeal rights under a statute other than ch. 75 of title 5, or were covered under a negotiated grievance procedure so as to limit their appeal right to the Board. Moreover, the committee report on the 1990 Amendments suggests that Congress expected "attorneys...at the Department of Justice" to fall within the revised definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 3, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 4-1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 697 ("attorneys" are included in the excepted service; that an employee "is not in the competitive service does not mean that the employee can be hired or fired at whim. As an attorney who has tried to get a job at the Department of Justice knows, hiring is extremely competitive"). There is no suggestion that AUSAs were to be excluded from the revised definition or that they had been excluded under prior definitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, it is undisputed that the appellant served over 2 years of current continuous service as an AUSA in the excepted service. We therefore conclude, contrary to the administrative judge's ruling, that the appellant is an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) with the right to appeal her removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Hamlett</span> was <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fausto</span> presented the question of whether the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA") precluded a nonpreference eligible employee in the excepted service from seeking judicial review for an allegedly improper job suspension. Such review was admittedly not available before the MSPB under the CSRA. But the employee asserted that review was available in the Court of Claims under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 440-41. The Supreme Court noted that the CSRA "comprehensively overhauled the civil service system" and created an elaborate "new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against" executive branch employees, including the right to appeal agency decisions to the MSPB and then to this court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 443, 446 (citation omitted). But "[n]o provision of the CSRA gives nonpreference eligible members of the excepted service the right to administrative or judicial review" of adverse personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 443. Because the employee was classified as a "nonpreference eligible [employee] in the excepted service," the Court held that the CSRA precluded judicial review under the Back Pay Act, as well as under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was so because Congress intended the CSRA to provide "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review" of personnel action taken <span id="Page_73"></span>against executive branch employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 445. The Court found that "the comprehensive nature of the CSRA [and the failure to provide review to nonpreference eligible employees as part of the comprehensive scheme for review], combine to establish a congressional judgment that those employees should not be able to demand judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 448. Thus, the CSRA's "deliberate exclusion of employees in respondent's service category from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action of the sort at issue here prevent[ed] respondent from seeking review in the Claims Court under the Back Pay Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other circuits have read <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> to preclude executive branch employees (when not entitled to MSPB review as to adverse personnel actions) from resort to review through CBA grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel v.

Those circuits have relied on the election of remedies provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) (set forth below) as allowing arbitration only as an alternative to MSPB review.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because title 5 of the United States Code does not apply to the appellant's position in the first place. Specifically, he found that the appellant was appointed under 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7471(a)(1), which provides that the Tax Court may appoint clerks "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service." On review, the appellant argues that her position was, in fact, covered under title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the appellant. Excluding a position from the appointing requirements applicable to the competitive service means only that the position is in the excepted service; it does not mean that the position is excluded from the requirements of title 5 in general. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 590, 593 (1994). The statutory language at issue here is materially identical to the statutory language at issue in <span class="Italic">Briggs v.

The Board found that, although this appointment provision placed the appellant in the excepted service, it did not exclude her from coverage under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 334-35. We likewise find that the language excepting 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7471(a) positions from competitive-service appointing provisions does not serve to exclude such appointments generally from chapter 75 coverage. Nevertheless, our finding does not change the result of this appeal because the appellant still fails to meet the basic definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a). <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 5.</p>

While we agree with the Board that &#x00A7; 209(f) places Ms. Lal into the excepted service, it does not exempt her from the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990, which provide appeal rights to certain excepted service employees.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Lal was appointed as a distinguished consultant in the excepted service pursuant to &#x00A7; 209(f), which provides that consultants "may be appointed without regard to the civil-service laws." The agency understood this to mean that Ms. Lal was not subject to the statutory due process requirements of the civil-service laws under title 5 of the United States Code, and terminated her employment without providing notice of the termination or a right to respond, as would ordinarily be required by the civil-service laws. Ms. Lal appealed to the Board, which concluded that &#x00A7; 209(f)'s "appointed without regard to the civil-service laws" language deprived the Board of jurisdiction. Ms. Lal appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the Board's decisions is limited by statute.

"Taken together, these statutory provisions make clear that tenured employees--those individuals who meet the definition of an 'employee' set forth in &#x00A7; 7511--can seek Board review of adverse actions as defined in &#x00A7; 7512, including removals." <span class="Italic">Archuleta v.

For the reasons set forth below, we agree with Ms. Lal that &#x00A7; 209(f) does not provide such an exception.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin, as we must, with the plain language of &#x00A7; 209(f), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In accordance with regulations, special consultants may be employed to assist and advise in the operations of the [Public Health] Service. Such consultants may be appointed without regard to the civil-service laws.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of the statute only speaks in terms of appointment authority, and does not discuss the removal of the employee. Because the statute does not include an explicit reference to removal ability, we must determine if the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990 extended appeal rights to employees appointed under &#x00A7; 209(f). If so, the Board has jurisdiction over Ms. Lal's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"It is a 'fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.'" <span class="Italic">Food and Drug Admin. v.

(internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 209(f) was enacted as part of the Public Health Service Act of 1944, which codified existing rules and regulations surrounding the operation of the Public Health Service, including the Public Health Commissioned Corps. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, H.R. Rep. No. 78-1364, at 1-4 (1944). As explained by the Surgeon General at the time, the Act provided for "a closely knit, highly trained commissioned corps of officers, who are specialists in public health, medicine, scientific research, and related specialists, as the best type of administrative structure to deal with national and international health problems." Alanson Wilcox, <span class="Italic">Public Health Service Act, 1944</span>, 7 Soc. Sec. Bull., Aug. 1944, at 15 (quoting Surgeon General Thomas Parran). To that end, what is now the Secretary of Health and Human Services was given authority to appoint "any officer or employee of the Service...in accordance with the civil-service laws." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(i). But, "[w]hen the Public Health Service requires the services of consultants who cannot be obtained when needed through regular Civil Service appointment..., special consultants to assist and advise the operations of the Service may be appointed," 42 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 22.3(a), pursuant to &#x00A7; 209(f), "without regard to the civil-service laws." To put it more simply, &#x00A7; 209(f) permits the Secretary to hire consultants into the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the civil-service laws matured, section 209(f) remained substantively unchanged. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) "comprehensively overhauled the civil service system," creating "a new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against 'employees'" within the newly formed Merit Systems Protection Board. <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 774 (1985).

Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 443 (1988). As is relevant here, the CSRA extended certain benefits, including the right to administrative review by the Board and appeal rights to this court, to individuals in the competitive service and "certain veterans and their close relatives--so-called 'preference eligibles,'" in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 441 n.1. But the CSRA did not extend these benefits to nonpreference eligible members of the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recognizing a gap in administrative and judicial appeal rights for non-preference eligible members of the excepted service, Congress enacted the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990 (the Due Process Amendments), Pub.L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (Aug. 17, 1990) (codified in relevant part at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511)). <span class="Italic">See Bennett</span>, 635 F.3d at 1220 (recognizing that Congress enacted the Due Process Amendments in response to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, where the Court held that the CSRA <span id="Page_74"></span>precluded judicial review for non-preference eligible members of the excepted service); <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep No. 101-328, at 1 (1989), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.C. 695 ("The key difference between the protections available to competitive service employees and preference eligibles in the excepted service, on the one hand, and excepted service employees who are not preference eligibles, on the other, is the right to appeal an adverse action to the Merit Systems Protection Board for independent review."). The Due Process Amendments broadened the CSRA's definition of covered employees to include non-preference eligible individuals in the excepted service "who [are] not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service," or "who [have] completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Due Process Amendments also include a list of categories of individuals who are excluded from title 5 protection, although they would ordinarily fall within the broad definition of "employee" set forth in &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(1)-(10). In addition to excluding political appointees and confidential or policy making positions, the Due Process Amendments also list seven additional categories of individuals that are excluded from &#x00A7; 7511's reach. Many of these categories were either expressly excluded by existing statute or regulation, or already subject to an appeal regime within a particular agency. For example, &#x00A7; 7511(b) excludes employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, the General Accounting Office, and the Veterans Health Services--all of whom were already excluded from the Board's appeals process. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, at 5, 6-7 (1989) ("The National Security Act of 1946 provides the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) with plenary authority to deal with personnel of the CIA. The General Accounting Office Personnel Act of 1980 provides comparable procedural rights for GAO employees through the GAO personnel Appeals Board. The employees at the Veterans Health Services and Research Administration are subject to a special peer review system.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With that context in mind, we find that &#x00A7; 209(f) merely ensures that the Secretary has the authority to hire individuals into the excepted service. And, after the Due Process Amendments, non-preference eligible members of the excepted service who, like Ms. Lal, have "completed 2 years of continuous service in the same or similar positions," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), and who do not fall within one of the enumerated excluded categories of individuals in &#x00A7; 7511(b), are "employees" ordinarily entitled to appeal rights at the Board. This conclusion is consistent with our precedent in <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995), and its progeny. That precedent stands for the proposition that, absent a specific exclusion of appeal rights or exemption from &#x00A7; 7511's definition of employee, a statute exempting an appointment from the civil-service laws cannot escape the broad reach of Due Process Amendments and therefore does not strip the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, we analyzed 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 241(a), which permitted certain "local installations to employ personnel whose 'compensation, tenure, leave, hours of work, and other incidents of the employment relationship may be fixed without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and the following:...(4) sections...7511, 7512, and 7701 of Title 5.'" 55 F.3d at 1578 (quoting &#x00A7; 241(a)). We found that this statutory language was sufficient to exempt the petitioner from appeal rights and we rejected the argument that the Due Process Amendments impliedly repealed &#x00A7; 241(a). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. It was of no consequence that the Due Process Amendments expanded the definition of "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511 because 20 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 241(a) explicitly exempted hired personnel from the definition of "employee" in &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">See Todd</span>, 55 F.3d at 1577-78 (rejecting the argument that "the general provisions of section 7511(a)(1)(C) trump specific exceptions of section 241(a)"). Indeed, given that &#x00A7; 241(a) excluded preference-eligible members before the enactment of the Due Process Amendments, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. Law. 89-77, 79 Stat. 243 (July 21, 1965) (explaining that the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 does not apply), and the Due Process Amendments were intended to give the same benefits to non-preference excepted service members as those held by preference eligible excepted service members, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> at 5-6, it is not surprising that the Due Process Amendments could not be read to give additional appeal rights to the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Todd</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A key factor in <span class="Italic">Todd</span> was &#x00A7; 241(a)'s explicit reference to the statutory provisions granting appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("[A]s <span class="Italic">Todd</span> amply demonstrates, Congress knows how to exempt a civil service position from the protections found in chapters 75 and 77 of title 5 if it so desires."). Thus, we found in <span class="Italic">Todd</span> that "there is no irreconcilability or repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel." <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, 55 F.3d at 1578.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, we reviewed 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 783(a)(1), which states that the National Council on Disability (Council) "may appoint, without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates, an Executive Director...." Because "Congress gave the Council the option of disregarding only certain parts of title 5," which did not include removal protections or the definition of employee in &#x00A7; 7511, we held that &#x00A7; 783(a)(1) did not exempt the Executive Director from the broad reach of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388. Therefore, personnel hired pursuant to &#x00A7; 783(a)(1) are hired into the excepted service and fall within the gamut of the Due Process Amendments and &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span>, we found that a statute that explicitly gives the authority to "appoint[ ] ...and remove[ ] ...without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service" was sufficient to exempt the position from the reach of the Due Process Amendments. 635 F.3d at 1219-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike the statutes at issue in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> and <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) merely states "appoint without regard to the civil-service laws" and does not include an explicit reference to removal or &#x00A7; 7511. As a result, we decline to find an additional implicit exemption to &#x00A7; 7511(a)'s definition of "employee" for special consultants like Ms. Lal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find no conflict between &#x00A7; 209(f)'s authority to hire employees into the excepted service and the Due Process Amendments' extension of appeal rights to non-preference eligible members of the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Cf. Todd</span>, 55 F.3d at 1577-78 (finding "no irreconcilability or repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel"). Rather, &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) operates in this situation as it was intended: it extends administrative and judicial appeal rights to non-preference eligible members of the excepted service. To the extent the OPM's implementing regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) calls for a result contrary to the plain meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f), "it has no force or effect in this case," <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that Ms. Lal was hired into the excepted service pursuant to &#x00A7; 209(f) and, because &#x00A7; 209(f) does not explicitly exempt personnel from the definition of "employee" in &#x00A7; 7511 or include specific reference to removal authority, the Due Process Amendments extended jurisdiction over Ms. Lal's claims. Accordingly, we reverse the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Suzal v. Director, USIA</span>, 32 F.3d 574 (D.C. Cir. 1994), determined that an employee can be in the excepted service yet lack the protection of the Due Process Amendments because his appointment is made without regard to civil service laws. The appointment procedures of the Department of Veterans Affairs, [discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-186.html#sec1-184">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>,"] provide one example of statutory appointment authority permitting exclusion of employees from Due Process Amendments protections.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lal</span> was followed, <span class="Italic">Suzal</span> was not, in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Dept. of State</span>, 2022 MSPB 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13 (2022), examining appointment authority for specific reference to exclusion of employees from Chapter 75 Board appellate rights ("Thus, we must look to whether chapter 75 appeal rights were specifically excluded"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 4, 1990, the agency appointed the appellant as a nonpreference eligible to the excepted-service Technical Information Specialist position, GG-12, at the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN). The legal authority for the appointment recorded in her Standard Form 50 (SF-50) was United States Code chapter 22, section 287 (22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287). Section 287 of title 22 provides for the President to appoint individuals to various positions at the United Nations (U.N.). The appellant's SF-50 remarks section also states: "Appointment without regard to civil service and classification laws in accordance with Public Law 341 (Section 8) Amendment to the U.N. Participation Act of 1945." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 8 of the U.N. Participation Act is codified at 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is hereby authorized to be appropriated annually to the Department of State, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as may be necessary for the payment by the United States of...all necessary salaries and expenses of the representatives provided for in section 287 of this title, and of their appropriate staffs, including personal services in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, without regard to the civil-service laws and chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2014, the agency suspended the appellant for 30 days on charges of unprofessional behavior and disruptive behavior. The appellant appealed the 30-day suspension as an adverse action under chapter 75, arguing that the suspension was in retaliation for filing equal employment opportunity complaints concerning alleged discrimination based on <span id="Page_75"></span>race, color, and disability. The agency filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The administrative judge informed the appellant in a show cause order that the Board may not have jurisdiction over her adverse action appeal. The appellant responded to the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack or jurisdiction. In doing so, she relied on a regulation issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), which states that "[a]n employee whose agency or position has been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority" is excluded from coverage of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 unless there is a provision specifically placing those employees under the protections of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12).[1] The administrative judge noted that OPM's most commonly used language to describe a statutory exclusion was "without regard to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, governing appointments in the competitive service" or "without regard to the civil-service laws." 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191, 13,192 (Mar. 10, 1993). Given this language, the administrative judge found that 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e constituted a separate statutory authority which exempts USUN employees from the appointment provisions of title 5. She also found that the appellant pointed to no statutory provisions or any evidence that would specifically place her under the protections of chapter 75 despite an initial exclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;OPM also has indicated in its comments to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12) that, although most statutory authorities only reference "appointments," "all that is required for a statutory exclusion from chapter 75 is a legislative exclusion from the appointing requirements of title 5, United States Code, in the absence of any provision to place the employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5." 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191, 13,192 (Mar. 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arriving at this conclusion, the administrative judge also relied on <span class="Italic">Suzal v. Director, U.S. Information Agency</span>, 32 F.3d 574, 578-79 (D.C. Cir. 1994). In <span class="Italic">Suzal</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) was faced with a similar question of whether an appointment authority, 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1474(1), excluded an employee appointed under that authority from the civil service laws altogether. <span class="Italic">Suzal</span>, 32 F.3d at 578-79. The court in <span class="Italic">Suzal</span> stated that "it would distort the statutory language to hold that people employed 'without regard to the civil service...laws' are actually covered by all the civil service laws applicable to members of the excepted service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 578.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears undisputed that the appellant fits within the statutory definition of an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C), and thus is entitled to appeal rights under chapter 75 unless otherwise excepted by statute. The crux of this case is whether the appellant's appointing authority, 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e, excludes her from the protections of chapter 75. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant is not exempt from chapter 75 protections and that the Board has jurisdiction over her adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 287e of title 22 of the U.S. Code does not preclude the appellant's adverse action appeal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, Congress enacted the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990 (the Due Process Amendments), Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990) (codified in relevant part at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511), which created administrative and judicial appeal rights for nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service, such as the appellant, that were not previously available to them under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), which gave limited administrative and judicial review rights to those in the competitive service and preference eligibles in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Lal v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 821 F.3d 1376, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Despite providing administrative and judicial appeal rights to nonpreference eligibles in the excepted service generally, the Due Process Amendments nevertheless included a list of categories of individuals who are excluded from title 5 protection, even though they may otherwise fall within the broad definition of "employee" set forth in section 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1379. Those exclusions include political appointees and confidential or policy-making positions, as well as seven additional categories listed at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(1)-(10).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of the appellant's SF-50 remarks section only speaks in terms of appointment authority and does not discuss any other possible agency action. Further, the applicable statute fails to reference an "appointment" and discusses only the "salaries and expenses" of those representatives provided for in section 287. 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e. Thus, because neither the SF-50 remarks section, nor 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e, include an explicit reference to the agency's ability to take an adverse action against the appellant, the Board must determine if the Due Process Amendments extend appeal rights to employees appointed under section 287e. <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1378.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, our reviewing court addressed the question of whether, in light of the Due Process Amendments, the appointing authority of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f) excluded the appellant in that case from chapter 75 protections. 821 F.3d at 1380. That statute states "[i]n accordance with regulations, special consultants may be employed to assist and advise in the operations of the [agency]. Such consultants may be appointed without regard to the civil-service laws." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f). After discussing the CSRA and the Due Process Amendments in detail, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) found that, "absent a specific exclusion of appeal rights or exemption from section 7511's definition of employee, a statute exempting an appointment from the civil-service laws cannot escape the broad reach of [the] Due Process Amendments and therefore does not strip the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an adverse action." 821 F.3d at 1380. The court explained that, "[t]o the extent OPM's implementing regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.410(d)(12) calls for a result contrary to the plain meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f), 'it has no force or effect in this case.'" <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1381 (quoting <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f), 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e contains no language exempting appointees from section 7511's definition of "employee." 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e. Thus, we must look to whether chapter 75 appeal rights were specifically excluded. <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1380-81. The statutory language only makes a general reference to "civil-service laws," but it goes on to explicitly exclude "chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5." 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e. There is no reference in the statute that explicitly excludes the appellant from the protections of chapter 75 appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As our reviewing court noted, "Congress knows how to exempt a civil service position from the protections found in chapters 75 and 77 of title 5 if it so desires." <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388. Because Congress could have excluded appointees from the protections of chapter 75 in enacting 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e, as it explicitly chose to do with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53, we find that 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e does not preclude the appellant from exercising her appeal rights pursuant to chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388 (finding that an appointment under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 783(a)(1) made "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions...of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates" did not exempt the appointee from the broad reach of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) in light of the Due Process Amendments). Further, to the extent 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.410(d)(12) calls for a result contrary to the plain meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 and 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e, "'it has no force or effect in this case.'" <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1381 (quoting <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d at 1388).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite what appears to be a contradictory ruling from the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">see Suzal</span>, 32 F.3d at 578-59, it is well settled that decisions of other circuit courts are persuasive, but not controlling authority, and that decisions of the Federal Circuit constitute precedent binding on the Board, <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Therefore, we are bound by the Federal Circuit's ruling in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> and find that 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 287e does not foreclose Board jurisdiction over the appellant's adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lal</span> and <span class="Italic">Malloy, supra,</span> were summarized by <span class="Italic">Coleman v. DHS</span>, DA-3443-17-0273-I-1 (NP 4/6/2023), involving a Stafford Act employee's appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge based her decision that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal on OPM regulation 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), coupled with language in the Stafford Act stating that appointments were made under that hiring authority "without regard to the provisions of Title 5." However, in reaching this decision, the administrative judge did not consider the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lal v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 821 F.3d 1376 (2016). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> appealed her removal as a Distinguished Consultant at the Department of Health and Human Services, which was a position created under a statutory special appointment authority, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 209(f). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, concluding that section 209(f) granted appointments "without regard to civil-service laws," and that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(12), this language deprived the Board of jurisdiction over the appellant's removal appeal. <span class="Italic">Lal v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-14-0852-I-1, Final Order, &#x00B6; 2 (Mar. 25, 2015). The Board agreed, affirming the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-14; <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1377-78. However, on appeal, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board, concluding that under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, and the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (codified in relevant part at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511), absent a specific exclusion of appeal rights or exemption from section 7511's definition of "employee," a statute broadly exempting an appointment from "the civil-service laws" did not strip the Board of jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an adverse action taken against that employee. <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, 821 F.3d at 1379-80. Instead, the Federal Circuit concluded, the Board must look to the language of the appointment authority to determine whether it included a specific exclusion of chapter 75 appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380-81. The court also concluded that to the extent OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.410(d)(12) called for a contrary result, it had "no force or effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381. Concluding that nothing in the broad statutory language stating that appointments under section 209(f) were <span id="Page_76"></span>made "without regard to the civil-service laws" exempted the appellant's position from section 7511(a)'s definition of "employee," the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Malloy v. Department of State</span>, 2022 MSPB 14, the Board applied the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Lal</span> for the first time, reversing and remanding the initial decision dismissing the appellant's adverse action appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, the Board concluded that the implementing language for the appointment authority at issue in that case only explicitly excluded "chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of Title 5," and made no reference to chapter 75 appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12. Relying on <span class="Italic">Lal</span>, the Board concluded that because the appointing authority did not explicitly exclude appointees from the protections of chapter 75 (specifically, those relating to removal), as it did with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53, the appellant was not precluded from pursuing her appeal rights pursuant to chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Also excluded from the definition of "employee" under the Due Process Amendments are employees serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(i).
