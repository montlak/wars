<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-85"><span class="space">c.</span> Necessity for Specific Instances</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 4303(b)(1)(A)(i) requires proposal notices in unacceptable performance actions to cite "specific instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the proposed action is based." The decision letter must specify the instances of unacceptable performance leading to removal or demotion. Statements in the proposal letter such as "failed to supervise employees in an adequate manner," "failed to insure adequate program development," and "incapable of interpreting orders" were insufficient to meet the statutory requirement of citation of specific instances. The phrases were broad and vague. They lacked factual specificity and caused the action to be set aside under the harmful error standard governing minimum requirements of proposal and decision letters. <span class="Italic">Coltrane v. Dept. of Army</span>, 25 MSPR 397, 403 (1984). Under <span class="Italic">Coltrane,</span> if the charges and instances of unacceptable performance are stated with sufficient specificity in the proposal, it is not necessary to repeat them in the decision letter that refers to the proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kadlec v. Dept. of Army</span>, 49 MSPR 534, 540 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The notice letter may incorporate charges by reference to a performance appraisal providing specific instances of alleged unsatisfactory performance, as long as the appellant understands the charges. <span class="Italic">Harms v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3345); <span class="Italic">Christenhusz v. Dept. of Army</span>, 28 MSPR 585, 587 &#x0026; n.3 (1985) ("it is not necessary for the decision letter to specifically repeat the charged instances of unacceptable performance...[I]t is sufficient if such charges have been previously specified and are identified by suitable reference"). The specificity of a proposal notice need not be as great if the notice is preceded by specific warning notices and counseling reports, as well as examples of poor performance. <span class="Italic">Hays v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-542). The proposal need not state specific examples of unacceptable performance if additional information places the appellant on notice of the period of his deficient performance. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 37 MSPR 78, 81-82 (1988). Counseling sessions during the PIP can make up for a lack of specificity in the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Addison v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 261, 267 (1990). The key question is whether the appellant is able to respond to the agency's allegations during the response period following the proposal letter. <span class="Italic">Shorter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 622, 627 (1985). As long as the employee is on fair notice of why an action is being taken, the notice will be considered sufficiently specific. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 305, 310 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Incorporation by reference occurred in <span class="Italic">Mouser v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 619, 623-24 (1986), overturning an AJ's decision that set the removal aside for lack of a specific notice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the notice of proposed removal, the agency set forth twelve examples of the general types of errors it claimed the appellant had been making....&#8197;The notice made clear the fact that the examples were illustrative in nature, that the appellant had received copies of all monthly reports and daily end-of-line review sheets listing all of the errors he was alleged to have made....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is sufficient evidence of record to show that the agency did not commit harmful procedural error due to insufficient specificity of its proposal notice. As noted above, the proposal notice informed the <span id="Page_2957"></span>appellant that he had received copies of all daily and monthly review sheets and reports, by which he had been apprised of the specific details of all the errors he was alleged to have made, and that he could review all material relied upon by the agency to document those errors and support its removal proposal. Further, the agency's memoranda to the appellant, documenting the number and type of his alleged errors for each month of the performance improvement period, provided the appellant with notice of all of the cases in question, not merely the twelve examples set forth in the proposal notice. Therefore, we do not believe the presiding official's reference to the <span class="Italic">Coltrane</span> [25 MSPR 397 (1984)] case is apposite. In that case, unlike this case, the Board found that the proposal notice and the performance appraisal incorporated therein did not cite any specific incidents of unacceptable performance and did not provide any information as to how, when and where the employee's job performance was deficient....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As also noted above, the appellant's responses to the proposal notice did not claim or betray any confusion on his part regarding the nature and extent of the charges or his inability to respond to them, nor did he attempt to demonstrate such at any time during his appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Hearn v. GSA</span>, 41 MSPR 280, 284-85 (1989), determined that it was sufficient for the proposal letter to give examples of unacceptable performance if the appellant was kept current during the PIP of other examples of deficiencies. As to allegedly vague specifications in a Chapter 43 case, <span class="Italic">Cranwill v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 610, 614 (1992), stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Coltrane</span> [25 MSPR 397 (1984)], the Board found harmful procedural error requiring the reversal of a removal action where the notice of proposed removal set forth only broad, vague, and nonspecific allegations of unacceptable performance, without citing any specific incidents....&#8197;The notice of proposed removal in this case, while not as specific as it might have been, did identify each of the loan files alleged to contain errors, indicated whether the error consisted of inadequate documentation, untimely referral for termination, or both, and in several instances stated the reason why documentation was inadequate....&#8197;Moreover, we note that the appellant filed a response to the notice of proposed removal in which he did not object to any lack of specificity. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the appellant failed to show that a lack of specificity in the proposal notice likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Willis v. SSA</span>, AT-0752-11-0867-I-1 (NP 5/3/2011), reiterated the need to demonstrate harmful error if the proposal notice is insufficiently specific:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits of the agency's action, the administrative judge found that the agency submitted extensive evidence that would normally be sufficient to meet its burden of proving that the appellant's performance was unacceptable. Nevertheless, because "the agency failed to meet a chapter 43 statutory notice requirement[,] " the administrative judge determined that it "was not entitled to rely on any of this evidence for the purpose of establishing that the appellant's performance was unacceptable." Specifically, the administrative judge found that the agency's notice of proposed reduction in grade failed to set forth any specific instances of unacceptable performance on which the agency based the proposed action, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(A)(i). The administrative judge further found that, even with respect to the generalized allegations in the notice, the agency failed to set forth the critical elements of the appellant's position involved in each instance of unacceptable performance, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(A)(ii). Thus, because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2)(B) mandates that the agency may only base such a reduction in grade on the instances of unacceptable performance for which it complied with the notice and other requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, and the administrative judge determined that there were no such instances on which the agency could rely, he concluded that the agency failed to prove by substantial evidence that the appellant failed to meet the established performance standards in one or more critical elements of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, in an action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, a tenured federal employee such as the appellant is entitled to "oral or written notice of the charges against [her], an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present [her] side of the story." <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of Labor</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 9 (2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985)). In this regard, due process requires that the agency's notice be sufficiently detailed to afford the employee a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 666. Therefore, both the potential <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that the administrative judge identified in his initial decision and the deficiencies in the agency's notice may have violated the appellant's right to due process by depriving him of a meaningful opportunity to respond to the agency's charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the basis on which the administrative judge reversed the agency's action, the Board has consistently found that the notice provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)--which require the agency to identify specific instances of unacceptable performance on which its proposed action is based--are procedural and therefore subject to a harmful error analysis. <span class="Italic">E.g., Coltrane v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 397, 403 (1984). In order to show harmful error, an appellant must prove that the procedural error at issue was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of that error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] . By reversing the agency's action, the administrative judge implicitly found that the agency's failure to provide proper notice harmed the appellant. Nevertheless, harmful error cannot be presumed, and the burden of showing that the error at issue caused substantial harm to his rights lies with the appellant. <span class="Italic">E.g., Henton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 15 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The harmful error issue was not addressed by the parties below, and it is unclear from the record whether the agency would have reached a different conclusion in the absence of its failure to provide the appellant with the statutorily required notice of its proposed action. Although the Board has in some cases decided the harmful error issue without remanding, the appellants in those cases typically had filed responses in which they did not object to any lack of specificity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cranwill v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 610, 614-15 (1992); <span class="Italic">Christenhusz v. Department of the Army</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 585, 586-87 (1985) (the appellant made detailed responses which did not indicate she was confused or uncertain regarding the agency's charges). Here, by contrast, the appellant did not respond to the agency's notice. Further, although the Board has determined that an agency's failure to meet the notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1) did not constitute harmful error because the agency's notice referenced a recent unsatisfactory performance appraisal, <span class="Italic">e.g., Christenhusz</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 587, we note that the notice at issue here fails to mention the performance appraisal that the agency issued the same day as its notice of proposed reduction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we remand the appeal to the regional office to allow the parties the opportunity to submit additional evidence and argument on the issues identified herein. After further development of the record, he administrative judge must first determine whether the agency violated the appellant's due process rights either by failing to provide a notice to which he could meaningfully respond or by considering information that was not included in the proposal notice. If he finds no such violation, the administrative judge should consider whether the same facts support a finding of harmful procedural error. If he finds no instance of harmful procedural error, the administrative judge shall adjudicate the appeal on the merits and may adopt his original findings on the appellant's affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand the Board determined that the appellant demonstrated harmful error as a result of the insufficiently specific Chapter 43 proposal notice, <span class="Italic">Willis v. SSA</span>, AT-0752-11-0867-B-1 (NP 8/19/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the second claim of harmful error, the administrative judge found, as he did in his first initial decision, that the agency failed to meet the notice requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1) regarding any specific instances of unacceptable performance; he found further that the deciding official credibly testified that she wanted to follow the proper procedure in arriving at her decision and that she was willing to follow the instructions provided to her regarding the information she could consider in reaching that decision. Thus, the administrative judge found that the appellant had established that it was likely that the deciding official, "if properly informed that the statute limited her to considering only those specific instances of unacceptable performance for which the agency complied with the notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, would have determined that the evidence (which, as set forth above, included no specific instances of unacceptable performance on which the agency was entitled to rely) was insufficient to support a decision that the appellant's performance failed to meet the established performance standards of the critical elements of his position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review of the remand initial decision, the agency contends that the administrative judge improperly interpreted and applied the harmful error standard. It argues that, rather than ask, as the administrative judge did, whether a different decision would have been made if the deciding official had been properly informed that she was prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2)(B) from basing her decision on instances of unacceptable performance for which the agency failed to provide statutorily sufficient notice, "the proper way to assess the likely effect of the error would be to consider the probable outcome if the deciding official had based her decision on a notice that was sufficient under the statute." Although the agency claims that the administrative judge's analysis "would ultimately lead to a finding of harmful procedural error in almost every case involving facts questioning the sufficiency of an agency's notice," it could also be said that the agency's formulation would almost never result in a finding of harmful error. Moreover, the agency's argument that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 fails to address an agency's duty to properly inform its deciding officials that the statute limits them to considering only those specific instances of unacceptable performance <span id="Page_2958"></span>for which the agency gave proper notice, does not establish that a deciding official is absolved of her responsibility to follow the law in effecting an action under chapter 43 in the absence of such an explicit iteration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases cited by the agency in support of its arguments regarding harmful error, are distinguishable from the instant matter in which the administrative judge observed that both the agency's notice and contemporaneous assessment of the appellant's performance failed to have the requisite specificity, and the appellant did not respond to the agency's proposed action. In each of the cases the agency cited, the Board either found that the agency's notice itself was statutorily sufficient or found a redeeming factor that obviated the harm caused by the agency's failure to provide the required notice. For example, in <span class="Italic">Cranwill v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 610, 614-15 (1992), the Board found that the agency's notice was sufficient in that it identified each of the files alleged to contain errors as well as the type of error involved. Additionally, the appellant in that case filed a response to the agency's proposal in which he did not object to the lack of specificity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Addison v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 261, 267 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 945 F.2d 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the Board found that the appellant's performance improvement plan identified the specific cases for which his performance was not acceptable. In <span class="Italic">Mouser v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 619, 622-24 (1986), the agency's proposal cited 12 specific examples which were in and of themselves sufficient to carry the agency's burden of proof. Lastly, in <span class="Italic">Christenhusz v. Department of the Army</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 585, 586-87 (1985), the appellant's contemporaneous performance assessment cited specific instances of unsatisfactory performance and the applicable critical elements. The record does not indicate that any of these ameliorating circumstances are present in the instant matter. We therefore agree with the administrative judge that the agency committed harmful procedural error.</p>
