<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-68"><span class="space">b.</span> Enforced Leave</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were awarded after an agency improperly placed an employee on enforced leave. The constructive suspension without adverse action rights severely prejudiced the employee's right to defend himself against the action. <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 467, 470 (1984); <span class="Italic">Kenny v. IRS</span>, 9 MSPR 464, 467 (1982) (agency refused to permit the appellant to go back to work after she had received medical clearance to return to duty); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Barson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 22 MSPR 303, 306 (1984), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. But in <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 30 MSPR 271, 274-75 (1986), the employee was placed on enforced leave improperly and initially denied fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of the Army</span>, 5 MSPR 265 (1981), the Board found that the agency's failure to provide appellant procedural rights for an improper suspension arising when the agency refused to let appellant return to work was not gross procedural error. In reaching this conclusion, the Board found that although the suspension was improper, the agency had substantial medical reasons for its decision not to let appellant return to work and its physicians were concerned for appellant's welfare.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly in the present case, the agency had substantial medical evidence to support its decision to place appellant on enforced leave pending OPM determination of appellant's disability retirement application....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency's action was proper at the time it took the action because the case which provided the basis for appellant's successful appeal was not decided until three years after appellant was placed on enforced leave. In addition, appellant's inability to work is evidenced by OPM's granting his disability retirement and appellant has not appealed that determination. Since the agency's decision to place appellant on enforced leave was reasonable, it did not commit gross procedural error by failing to provide him the required procedural protections....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find the present case different than the cases presented by <span class="Italic">King v. United States Postal Service</span>, 20 MSPR 467 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Kenny v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 9 MSPR 464 (1982). In <span class="Italic">King</span>, the agency failed to identify any duty appellant could not perform or consider appellant's medical evidence regarding his fitness for duty when it relieved him of his duties. In <span class="Italic">Kenny</span>, the agency refused to let appellant return to work after he had been found fit. As discussed earlier, in the instant case, appellant was clearly incapable of performing his duties....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woodall</span> was appealed to the Federal Circuit. The Board requested and received a remand so that it could reconsider the case. Results returned in <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 132-34 (1987). The Board reversed its position and found that fees should have been paid, leaving the amount for determination on remand to the region. Regarding the agency's argument that fees should not be awarded because, having followed judicial precedent, it was not at fault for enforcing leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consideration of this issue requires an examination of the interrelationship among all the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories and three <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories in particular: Category 4, the category at issue in this appeal; category 2 (the agency's action was clearly without merit, wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges); and category 5 (the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding). <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 434-35. As originally formulated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the language of three of the five categories clearly made the agency's fault a controlling consideration: Category 1 (the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice), category 3 (the agency initiated the action against the employee in bad faith) and category 5 (the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding). For categories <span id="Page_4599"></span>2 and 4, the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> decision formulated a balancing test in which the agency's fault or lack of fault was one consideration that was weighed against the appellant's fault or weighed against other factors. Thus, in a footnote appended to category 2, the Board stated that it would examine "the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action" in determining whether the agency's action was clearly without merit, wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 434 n.35. Paralleling this analysis, the Board also appended a footnote to the gross procedural error category which set out a similar balancing test which weighed the "nature of and any excuse for the [agency's procedural] error against the prejudice and burden resulting for the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 435 n.36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision in <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>...and in <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span>,...the court found that the Board erred in interpreting <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 2. Although the court's decisions did not address the gross procedural error category which is at issue in this appeal, we find that these decisions articulated a general principle which has a broader application beyond any particular <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category and makes the Board's reconsideration appropriate. In <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, the court found that the Board had erroneously interpreted the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories so as to require an agency to be at fault as a general prerequisite for an award of attorney fees....&#8197;[T]he court emphasized that the purpose of awarding fees under the substantially innocent subcategory of category 2 is not to punish the agency for wrongdoing, but to serve to compensate the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the court's clear rejection of the Board's incorporation of a fault test in <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 2, we can find no basis to conclude that the agency's fault, or lack thereof, should be the controlling factor in determining an award of fees under category 4....&#8197;Additionally, we note that the focus of the gross procedural error category is not on the agency's motivation or good faith <span class="Italic">per se</span>, as it implicitly is in categories 1, 3, and 5, but on the effect of the agency's procedural error on the employee's rights. We do not believe that the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> and <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span> provide a basis for completely eliminating any consideration of the agency's fault in assessing a fee award under category 4. We conclude, however, that the agency's lack of fault in committing the procedural error should not be the predominant consideration, at least in a case such as this where the agency failed to afford the appellant any procedural protections. To the extent that the Board's prior decisions interpreting the gross procedural error category may be read as making the agency's fault, or lack thereof, the controlling factor, they are hereby modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the agency's excuse for its procedural error in the instant appeal is weighed against the prejudice and burden that resulted for the appellant, we find that the balancing test clearly weighs in favor of a finding of gross procedural error. The agency contends that its failure to provide the appellant with any adverse action rights should be excused because it was following the caselaw on this issue that existed at the time. We do not find that this relieves the agency of its responsibility for its failure to provide the appellant with any adverse action rights. The court in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> did not purport to announce a new rule of law. To the contrary, the court found that there was ample support for its holding in the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 as well as pre-Reform Act practice....&#8197;Thus, it can be argued that the agency (as well as the Board) should have known before <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> that adverse action rights were required for such enforced leave actions. In any event, to the extent that the agency can be viewed as not culpable for its error because the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> decision announced a rule that was different than existing Board precedent, the appellant was not culpable either. The appellant received no adverse action rights and the enforced leave lasted nearly four months, during which the appellant suffered a loss of pay. More than three years elapsed between the time appellant appealed and the Board's decision reversing the action. Under the particular circumstances of this case, including our previous finding that the extent of the appellant's victory was significant, we conclude that the agency's failure to provide the appellant with any adverse action rights severely prejudiced the appellant, prolonged the proceeding, and therefore constituted gross procedural error warranting an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 115, 121-22 (1989), summarized <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the administrative judge erred in granting attorney fees for work in connection with the appellant's removal on the basis that the agency committed gross procedural error. It argues that previous cases where the Board found such error are distinguishable because they involve either clear violations of statutes or situations where the agency constructively suspended an employee without affording him any procedural rights. In <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 33 MSPR 127, 133-34 (1987), however, the Board concluded that the agency's lack of fault in committing procedural error should not be the predominant consideration in determining whether fees are warranted and therefore that the agency's action was reasonable at the time it was taken may not be viewed as the dispositive or controlling factor. Rather, the agency's excuse for its procedural error must be weighed against the prejudice and burden that resulted for the appellant, but it should not receive significantly more emphasis than the other factor in the balancing test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 133-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency committed gross procedural error in denying the appellant a predecision hearing or advisory arbitration in accordance with its own regulations and therefore that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under this criterion. In its decision, the court quoted the agency's reason for denying the appellant a predecision hearing and a predecision advisory arbitration to be "because of circumstances which are such that keeping you on active duty may result in damage to Government property or may be injurious to you or your fellow workers." <span class="Italic">Mercer,</span> 772 F.2d at 857. This is an insufficient excuse, given that the agency had been informed by the psychiatric examination that the appellant was fit for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the excuse had some validity, we must weigh the prejudice and burden suffered by the appellant against it. As the administrative judge found, in accord with the court's decision, the appellant introduced undisputed evidence that the official who proposed his initial 35-day suspension advised him that he would be allowed to return to his position after the suspension if he were found fit for duty. Because of an organizational change during the suspension, a new official became the proposing official, issued a notice cancelling the proposed suspension, and proposed the appellant's removal. This evidence of differing views within the agency shows that the appellant might not have been removed if he had been afforded a predecision hearing or advisory arbitration. As the court noted, a person has a better chance to successfully contest an action before the action occurs. <span class="Italic">See Mercer,</span> 772 F.2d at 859-60. The administrative judge therefore properly found that the denial of a predecision hearing or advisory arbitration unnecessarily prolonged the proceeding and severely prejudiced the appellant. Thus, we conclude that the agency's action constituted gross procedural error.</p>
