<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-203"><span class="space">7.</span> Discourtesy; Related Problems</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Frustrated with constituent complaints about discourteous government employees, Congress enacted as a part of the 1978 Reform Act a provision specifically defining discipline of employees found to be discourteous to the public. That statute is inapplicable to charges of discourtesy by one government employee to another or to a supervisor, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3295):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Edwards also argues that the AJ misinterpreted 5 USC 7503(a). That statute provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an employee may be suspended for 14 days or less for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service (including discourteous conduct to the public confirmed by an immediate supervisor's report of four such instances within any one-year period).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7503(a). Mr. Edwards interprets this language as requiring four instances of discourteous conduct before a suspension may be imposed. However, the requirement of four instances of confirmed discourtesy relates to conduct involving a member of the public. Mr. Edwards does not contend that any of the instances in question involved members of the public. Accordingly, the agency was not barred from taking action based on the two instances here of record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute does not limit the disciplinary sanction that the agency may impose for discourtesy linked with other offenses, <span class="Italic">Roane v. DHHS</span>, 8 MSPR 339, 343-44 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, appellant contends that the penalty of demotion and reassignment was too harsh. Indeed he suggests it may be in and of itself illegal. For support appellant cites 5 USC &#x00A7; 7503(a)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The offenses for which appellant was demoted and reassigned are different and more serious than the offense described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7503(a). As has been previously noted, in addition to being discourteous to employees of another federal agency, the presiding official sustained charges that appellant's conversations with IRS employees constituted misuse of official duty time on non-agency matters and misrepresentation of authority; that they demonstrated lack of judgment expected of an employee of appellant's grade and position; and that they prejudiced the employing agency's ability to work with another agency and served to undermine the trust which should exist between appellant and the agency's principal regional official. We cannot conclude that the agency, or the presiding official, erred as matter of law in concluding that the sustained charges warranted discipline in excess of a 14 day suspension as described in &#x00A7; 7503(a).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;There is additional support in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7503(a) for reaching this conclusion. The statements of its sponsor, Congressman Levitas, in debate on the floor of the House September 11, 1978 make it clear that the provisions &#x00A7; 7503(a) are not intended to set maximum standards of discipline for other breaches of the employer-employee relationship of a more serious nature. 96th Cong. 1st Sess., Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 892-93 (1979). More significantly, the amendment which was adopted on the House floor provided that an agency could take action against an employee for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service <span class="Italic">including discourteous conduct to the public confirmed by an immediate supervisor's report of four such instances within any one-year period or any other pattern of discourteous conduct</span>. The language appeared in both Subchapter I and II of Chapter 75 of 5 USC, and was clearly intended to apply in both cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When action on the Civil Service Reform Act was completed by the House-Senate Conference Committee the discourteous conduct language had disappeared from Subchapter II, ostensibly because of efforts to eliminate superfluous language. Congressman Levitas became concerned that the statute would be interpreted in such a way that discourteous conduct would not be viewed as cause for action under Subchapter II (5 USC &#x00A7; 7513). This led to a floor colloquy during House consideration of the Conference Report between Levitas and Congressman Udall, floor manager of the bill. That colloquy, in part, was as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Levitas: "I would like to receive assurance from the chairman that, nevertheless, discourtesy on the part of a Federal employee under certain circumstances can constitute grounds for the application of the provisions of both subchapter 1 and under subchapter 2 as well."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Udall: "Absolutely. I want to assure the gentleman that the thrust and purpose of the amendment he offered on the House floor has been maintained...[T]he heart and substance of what the gentleman was trying to do is in here. It is stated in slightly different words. I can assure the gentleman that discourtesy can be the basis for removal action..."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">124<span class="Italic"> Congressional Record</span> H 11823 (daily ed. October 6, 1978). Thus while we need not reach the matter in the instant case, the legislative history clearly indicates that "discourteous conduct," standing alone, may in some circumstances warrant a penalty more severe than those contemplated in Subchapter I of Chapter 75. Of course in such circumstances the employee would be entitled to the greater panoply of procedural rights provided for in Subchapter II.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Not to be forgotten is the role courtesy to the public in performance based actions [discussed in <a href="0100-2023-08-102.html#sec1-101">Chapter 9</a>] . 5 USC 4302 provides:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Years ago the D.C. Circuit admonished that it is essential to the good of the federal service that supervisors conduct themselves with at least rudimentary courtesy toward subordinates, <span class="Italic">Green v. Baughman</span>, 243 F.2d 610, 613 (D.C. Cir. 1957). MSPB commend in the appeal styled <span class="Italic">In re Glover</span>, 1 MSPR 660, 663 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The efficient and proper performance of government business requires that employees treat each other with a minimum degree of courtesy in their daily contacts. Rude, inconsiderate behavior by fellow employees will affect office morale and, ultimately, work product. In addition, since the conduct of federal employees is often observable to members of the public, it affects the public's perception of government performance. Thus, requiring courtesy and consideration in work relations between government employees is consistent with the goals of the regulations to promote the proper performance of government business and to maintain citizen confidence in their government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was justified for a senior accountant, who had regular contact with banking officials, after two incidents of discourteous conduct within a 10-month period, despite counseling.

Although the allegations may have been the product of mental illness, they were disruptive and furnished the basis for action under the "efficiency of the service" standard. The Board mitigated removal to 30 days off in <span class="Italic">Carney v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 468, 475 (1991), after the appellant, a gate guard, failed to obey post orders by knowingly failing to salute an officer passing through in his car. There was no evidence that the failure to salute was a direct challenge to management, the infraction was "relatively minor," the appellant had 20 years of service, and he demonstrated his "potential for rehabilitation" by testifying that he would render salutes in the future. "[U]nprofessional conduct in dealing with taxpayers," apparently involving some element of discourtesy and coupled with a past disciplinary record, was sufficient to sustain removal of a tax examining assistant in <span class="Italic">Coyle v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The evidence of record plainly shows the demoralizing and unhealthy environment created by appellant's personal habits. The record also reflects that the agency frequently counseled appellant as to his hygiene and that appellant made no effort to change. The agency endured appellant's poor performance and unhygienic habits for many years. It need not exercise forbearance indefinitely. We find that appellant's removal based on three charges was not unreasonable.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Unwarranted allegations of improper behavior against coworkers and others warranted removal in <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250, 255-56 (1989). The allegations were not intentional. They were attributed to mental illness. But the disruption in the workplace caused by rude remarks and impolite acts supported the charge of creating a workplace disturbance. They did not require proof of intent, only workplace impact. Repeated discourtesy by a cashier toward commissary customers warranted removal of an employee with many years of service, but prior repeated counselings and progressive discipline. The charges involved the core of the appellant's job and reflected badly upon the agency's reputation for "customer-friendliness." <span class="Italic">Holland v.
