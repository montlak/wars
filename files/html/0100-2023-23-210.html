<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-208"><span class="space">b.</span> Obligation to Reinstate or Restore to Duty; Precondition to Restoration</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If a settlement agreement is written to reinstate the appellant, the expectation--without contrary provisions in the agreement--is that the employee will be placed back into the job held before the removal. Assignment to a different position or responsibilities violates the settlement. <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 106, 109 (1988) ("A position is comprised of more than mere title and pay. A necessary element is the duties required of the position. The appellant by being assigned to perform less than the full duties of the position has not been returned to the position as agreed."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3388) (evidence was required to resolve whether obligation to "reinstate" required placing appellant back to his former position or at least to a position of the same type; <span class="Italic">Vaughn</span> was discussed earlier under "<a href="0100-2023-23-196.html#sec16-202a">Time for Compliance if None Set in Settlement Agreement</a>").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to agreements that call for placement in a position, the agency must retain the individual in that position for a reasonable period of time before reassigning her, <span class="Italic">Woods v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 156, 159-60 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that the words of the agreement do not limit the agency's authority to alter the appellant's duties once she was placed in the EAS-15 position with EAS-18 save pay in October 1992, and therefore concluded that the agency was free to exercise its general discretionary right of reassignment after this date. However, the Board has found that where an agency has agreed to place an employee in a certain position, and the terms of the agreement are silent as to the time or duration of this performance, "a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed." <span class="Italic">Hicks v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992). Moreover, the Board will examine the motives of the agency in reassigning an employee following a settlement agreement, as well as its efforts to minimize any harmful effects on the employee, when deciding whether it has complied with the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 564-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Board found that the agency's reassignment of an employee did not constitute a breach of the parties' settlement agreement given that it took place after a 10-month period of full compliance, and only then as a result of a national arbitration decision, and given that the agency minimized the harm to the employee by preserving his pay level and placing him in a facility closer to his residence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the present case, the appellant was similarly reassigned after first serving for approximately a year in the position set forth in the settlement agreement. Furthermore, in finding that the reassignment was itself necessitated by valid managerial concerns following an agencywide reorganization, the administrative judge thoroughly analyzed the relevant facts, explaining in detail why he found the agency's evidence more credible than that offered by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987). The appellant's mere disagreement with the administrative judge's findings and credibility determinations does not show error. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 MSPB 297, 2 MSPR 129, 133-34 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). In addition, the agency acted to minimize harm to the appellant by reassigning her to a position at the same grade and pay. The appellant herself makes no showing that she was harmed as a result of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Hicks</span>, 52 MSPR at 565. Accordingly, we find that the agency did not breach the settlement agreement by reassigning the appellant in September 1993.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992) (regarding an agreement to assign the appellant to a particular location and position: "[w]here, as here, a settlement agreement is silent as to the time or duration of performance, a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed. <span class="Italic">See</span> I A.

<p class="Body-Text">What constitutes a reasonable period of restoration is a question of fact. The AJ must determine what is reasonable under the circumstances of the parties, and that determination requires evidence from the parties, not surmise from the AJ. The evidence of the parties should be acceptable in form, not simply unsworn assertions of the parties' representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ortega v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 422, 425-26 &#x00B6; 9 (2000) (remanding for development of evidence concerning the basis for reassignment of employee out of the limited-duty position assigned to him through settlement).<span class="Italic"> Guillette v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 459, 462-67 (1998), examined a number of circumstances relevant to the reasonableness of an employee's reassignment out of a position held through a settlement. The Board considered the agency's knowledge of the employee's health problems, and the provisions of negotiated agreements bearing on the accommodation of those problems; also considered was the treatment of similarly situated employees. In <span class="Italic">Guillette</span>, the balance tilted toward the appellant. The reassignment manifested agency bad faith in violation of the settlement. A Postal Service enforcement case, <span class="Italic">Outterbridge v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 427, 430 (1990), provided literal interpretation of a settlement agreement calling for an appellant's restoration to his previous status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the administrative judge's reasoning and conclusions. We note that the language of provision nine employs the term "restored." This word is derived from the noun "restoration," the plain meaning of which is "a bringing back into a former position or condition." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1971). Thus, by its terms and on its face, provision nine provides that the appellant will be returned to his prior status, including a full time position, albeit not to the Atlantic City post office. Moreover, as the appellant was never actually removed, the position to which he is to be restored following the suspension is, by implication, to carry the same status as his prior position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The settlement in <span class="Italic">Coon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 180, 184-85 (1994), called for the agency to "return [the appellant] to duty." Appellant complained that the agency failed to pay him in a timely manner since his return to duty. The agency's obligations were sufficiently expressed by the settlement agreement without the need for further elaboration as to its duty to timely pay the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is therefore necessary for us to construe paragraph 4 of the agreement, specifically that part of paragraph 4 providing for the appellant's "return to duty." In construing the words of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the written agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 526, 530 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).[4] The Board will not, however, interpret the language of an agreement in a way that unilaterally modifies an agreement. <span class="Italic">See Zamora v. Department of Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 544, 546 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare Zamora v. Department of Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 544, 545-47 (1993) (parol evidence was not necessary to construe the plain meaning of the word "penalty" as used in the agreement because such term was not ambiguous) <span class="Italic">with McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 673, 676-78 (1993) (parol evidence was necessary to resolve the meaning of the term "reinstatement" where the effective date of the reinstatement was not mentioned in the agreement and it was unclear whether the reinstatement was intended to be retroactive).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the phrase "return to duty" implicitly requires that he be paid in a normal and timely manner. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "return to duty" is not ambiguous. It simply means that the appellant will be returned to duty, and will, upon his return to duty, enjoy the same terms and conditions of employment that apply to other employees, including timely payment for services rendered in accordance with the agency's routine payroll procedures. There is nothing in the plain language of the phrase "return to duty" or elsewhere in the agreement that would lead us to a contrary conclusion. To interpret the phrase "return to duty" otherwise, so as <span class="Italic">not</span> to include the appellant's placement into the proper pay status resulting in his receipt of timely paychecks (normally a routine employment matter), would lead to an illogical result. The Board has stated that illogical interpretations are to be avoided. <span class="Italic">See Monahan v. US Postal Service</span>, 41 MSPR 153, 157 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200210139">949 F.3d 734</a>, 735-38 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Should a settlement require reinstatement following assessment of the accommodation required for a disabled employee, and if the agency delays the restoration beyond a reasonable time, <span class="Italic">Mincey v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 247, 251 &#x00B6; 12 (2002), implied that the employee should be retroactively reinstated on the date he would have received the position had the agency acted diligently.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Bolson v. DODDS</span>, 55 MSPR 8, 11 (1992), the appellant settled a performance-based removal from his teaching position by agreeing to reinstatement with a new period for monitoring, following a period allowed for familiarization with the students assigned to his class. The agreement essentially provided for summary removal, sans appeal if the appellant did not perform acceptably during the monitoring period. The appellant was again removed. The agency did not provide the appellant with the agreed-upon familiarization period. The Board enforced the agreement by directing the agency to cancel the removal and to reinstate the appellant in accordance with the terms of the settlement, i.e., by directing the agency to give the teacher another familiarization and monitoring period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Parties to an agreement should define the extent of restoration of prior status. There is a distinction between restoring an individual to a position and a provision in an agreement calling for the assignment of duties consistent with the appellant's status, for example, a GS-9 Contract Specialist. The agency does not violate the agreement by failing to assign the appellant every one of the duties of that position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 211, 214 (1995). An agreement that the employee may apply to the agency appointing official for reemployment was construed as the right to apply and be considered for appointment, not the right to an appointment. <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164, 169-70 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there are conditions to reinstatement or reemployment, the evidence must be sufficient to show that the conditions have been met. If an agency agrees in a settlement to consider an employee for reemployment following successful rehabilitative treatment for alcoholism, the medical evidence submitted by the employee concerning rehabilitation must be explicit and current regarding the treatment and results achieved. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez-Freytes v. DHHS</span>, 37 MSPR 526, 529 (1988) (letter from a doctor was terse, conclusory, failed to state whether appellant was being treated for addiction, and failed to explain if appellant was fully rehabilitated); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Leeds v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 113, 116-17 &#x00B6; 7, 2008 MSPB 30 (2008) (agreement that appellant complete all forms necessary to accomplish payment of back pay made it unnecessary for agency to specifically cite in the agreement to a particular form that appellant was required to complete); <span class="Italic">Saunders v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 225, 231-32 (1997) (agency breached agreement when it failed to reinstate appellant once he provided medical documentation from EAP counselor concerning the completion of an agreed-upon in-patient program). Reassignment was permitted of an appellant who breached a condition of a settlement agreement that defined the terms of his reinstatement, <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 526, 529-30 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, a condition of the settlement agreement was the requirement that an impartial psychiatrist, agreed upon by both parties, would perform a psychological fitness for duty examination of appellant. The parties agreed upon Dr. Hermann...who...found that appellant was suffering from a...personality disorder and recommended...treatments over a period of six months to a year.... He recommended that appellant be permitted to return to work while simultaneously undergoing treatment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Regional Director implicitly found that appellant breached the settlement agreement and acted in bad faith when appellant refused to undergo the course of therapy recommended.... He also found appellant's disruptive behavior to be justification for the agency's decision to reassign him to another position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's argument that the agency acted in bad faith in not reinstating him to his former position is without merit, in light of the fact that he had breached the settlement agreement....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Muzzipapa v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 559, 562 (1994), considered a settlement providing for conditional reinstatement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the settlement agreement the agency's obligation to reinstate appellant with back pay was conditioned on the appellant's performance of his promise to have "the required knee surgery," be released by his physician, and return to full duty. Appellant never had the knee surgery; instead, he submitted a note from his physician stating that he could return to full duty. Accordingly, the issue here is whether the appellant's proffered performance--the submission of his physician's note in lieu of surgery--was sufficient to trigger the agency's obligations under the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency reasonably expected to reinstate an employee physically able to perform the duties of a Warehouse Worker. Appellant contends that he has bestowed this benefit upon the agency as demonstrated by Dr. Eskow's note stating that he "may return to full work duties." While we agree with the appellant that it is immaterial how his knee was healed, we disagree that Dr. Eskow's note is sufficient to prove that he was fit for duty, Dr. Eskow's note does not indicate that he examined the appellant nor that he was aware of the nature of appellant's injury or the requirements of his position. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez-Freytes v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 37 MSPR 526, 529 (1988) (physician's conclusory statement that employee can return to work insufficient to show employee rehabilitated). Absent preponderant evidence of rehabilitation, we find that appellant has not rendered substantial performance of his obligations under the settlement agreement and, as a result, that the agency is not required to reinstate him with back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant challenges the agency's implementation of a settlement calling for reinstatement upon production of evidence demonstrating appellant's medical qualifications for a position, and if the Board finds that the medical evidence does not show that the employee can perform the duties of the position claimed through reinstatement, no violation of the agreement occurs when the appellant is not returned to the job, nor is there is an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Marchand v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3303). If a settlement provides for reinstatement upon appellant's psychiatric evaluation and ongoing therapy, the agency will not be faulted for failing to abide by its obligations under the agreement if the appellant does not fulfill these conditions. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1448), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 70, 77 (1989) (determining agency improperly removed appellant for alleged violation of a provision of agreement requiring psychiatric therapy; appellant was confused concerning his obligations and did not violate the settlement). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-135.html#sec16-133">Burden of Proof; Proof of Compliance</a>" as to the proof needed to demonstrate noncompliance with MSPB decisions not involving settlement agreements.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 154, 156 (1987), determined that a provision of an agreement requiring a medical fitness determination in order for the appellant to return to the job necessarily implied that the appellant's fitness extended to medical fitness to hold the security clearance required by the job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We find that the term "fit for duty" as generally used means the ability to perform all the duties of a position. Therefore, because the appellant would be unable to perform the duties of the position in question if he could not obtain a security clearance, we find that the ability to obtain a security clearance is included within the meaning of the term "fit for duty." We also find that the plain language of the agreement makes it clear that the position for which appellant was to be examined to determine his fitness for duty is his former position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coan v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0300-C-1 (NP 7/27/2022), determined that the agency breached a settlement effectively calling for the return of Mr. Coan to a police officer position, over the agency's defense that it could not do so because Mr. Coan's law enforcement officer credentials were no longer in effect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the agency argues that it had a compelling reason to reassign the appellant to a different position, as the agency's LETC revoked the appellant's badge and credentials, which is a condition of his employment as a police officer, so he was no longer qualified to hold that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an outside event or determination has rendered the appellant incapable of performing the duties of his former position, as long as that incapacity exists, the agency is not obligated to reinstate the appellant to his former position. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6; 13 (2003). For example, the Board has held that an agency had a compelling reason not to reinstate an appellant to his former position when he lost the security clearance required for the job he held prior to the adverse action at issue. <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 586, 594 (1993). Similarly, the Board has held that an agency demonstrated a compelling reason to not return an appellant, a criminal investigator, to the same work assignments he formerly performed when the two U.S. Attorneys' Offices in the districts in which the appellant would routinely operate had informed the agency that they would not call him as a witness absent exceptional circumstances, and neither the Board nor the agency had authority over the U.S. Attorneys' Offices. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 198, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 15-17. However, the Board may reach a different conclusion when the agency exercises its own discretion in altering the appellant's duties. For example, the Board has held that an agency did not restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> when the agency did not restore the appellant's special agent badge and credentials, and the grant of those items was within the agency's District Director's discretion. <span class="Italic">See Black</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 650, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency did not base its decision not to return the appellant to his former position and duties on an event or determination external to the agency. Rather, the Director of the LETC, a division internal to the agency, issued a decision requesting the return of the appellant's badge and credentials based on a January 28, 2015 letter from one of the appellant's supervisors. The agency argues that this action was taken in accordance with the agency policy set forth in VA Handbook 0730, section 7(b)(4)(a), which provides that "Directors are authorized <span id="Page_5085"></span>to suspend the arrest authority of any VA police officer whose judgment or professional competence is in doubt." VA Handbook 0730 &#x00A7; 7(b)(4)(a) (2000), <a href="https://www.va.gov/vapubs/search_action.cfm?dType=2">https://www.va.gov/vapubs/search_action.cfm?dType=2</a> (last visited July 26, 2022). The policy leaves the suspension of an officer's arrest authority to the discretion of the appropriate director, who is under the agency's authority. Thus, the agency exercised its own discretion in suspending the appellant's arrest authority and declining to reinstate him to his former position on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The January 28, 2015 letter, on which the Director's request for the return of the appellant's badge and credentials is based, and which the agency submits for the first time on review, does not bolster the agency's argument that it had a compelling reason to not reinstate the appellant to his former position. The Board generally will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d); <span class="Italic">see Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). The agency has not asserted that the letter was not available during the pendency of the compliance proceeding before the administrative judge, and thus we do not consider it on review. Moreover, the agency has not asserted that the letter identifies an event or determination, from a source over which the agency did not have authority that required the return of the appellant's badge and credentials and thus rendered him incapable of performing his duties. Accordingly, the agency has not set forth a compelling reason for why it did not return the appellant to his former duties as a Police Officer and therefore, it has not returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as required under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may limit the scope of reinstatement relief under a settlement if he later resigns from the agency, although the appellant might end up with an appeal from an allegedly forced removal, depending on the circumstances attending the resignation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coan v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0300-C-1 (NP 7/27/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties cannot expect the Board to enforce, and the agency will not be permitted to impede, settlement agreements through the imposition of new conditions after the agreement was accepted. If an agency agrees to reinstate an employee through a settlement, it cannot later add as a precondition to reinstatement a physical examination of the appellant if no mention was made of that requirement in the settlement. <span class="Italic">Grube v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 494, 499 (1989); <span class="Italic">Erreich v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 232, 234 (1985) ("Nowhere in the settlement agreement was it required that appellant take a physical examination before he could be returned to duty. Therefore, we conclude that the agency's delay in returning appellant to duty was not in compliance with the settlement agreement."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Durham v. TVA</span>, 42 MSPR 480, 484 (1989) (agency improperly unilaterally changed procedure for filling position that appellant was to receive by oral settlement).
