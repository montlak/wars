<p class="noindent">Under FLRA's current approach, an agency need not bargain as to a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change. If the agency has no duty to bargain, it has no duty to provide the <span id="Page_1298"></span>union with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over the matter. In applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, FLRA looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment. In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, FLRA addresses what a respondent knew, or should have known, at the time of the change. FLRA issued a General Statement of Policy or Guidance in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Education and USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-190.html">71 FLRA 968</a>, 971 n.31 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">vacated, AFGE v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220201137">25 F.4th 1</a> (D.C. Cir. 2022), primarily directed to impact and implementation bargaining, but extending to substantive bargaining the rule that negotiations are limited to a change to that has a substantial impact on a condition of employment. [Refer elsewhere in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-075.html#sec8-75">'Substantial Impact'; 2020 Interpretation and Guidance; Judicial Reversion to <span class="Italic">De Minimis</span> Standard</a>" for discussion of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Education</span>.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine was summarized by a decision considering an arbitrator's award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council 118 and DHS, ICE</span>, 69 FLRA 183, 187-88, 190 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before an agency may change bargaining-unit employees' conditions of employment, the agency must provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain under the Statute.[61] As relevant here, an agency is not required to bargain over the impact and implementation of a change unless the change will have a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect.[62] In assessing whether the effect of a change is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority "looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, <span class="Italic">or</span> the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining[-]unit employees' conditions of employment."[63] In other words, a change need not have actual effects that are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> in order to establish a bargaining obligation; <span class="Italic">reasonably foreseeable</span> effects that are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> are sufficient to establish such an obligation.[64] In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority looks to what the party knew, or should have known, at the time of the change.[65] "It is also the case that an analysis of whether a change is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> does not focus primarily on the actual effects of the change,"[66] but on reasonably foreseeable effects.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge found that the Respondent made changes to conditions of employment and that the effect of those changes was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because they required incumbent CRs to dedicate forty to sixty percent of their normal workdays to performing what were formerly SR duties. The Judge noted that the lower-graded SR duties, which are administrative in nature, are "not substantially similar" to the "investigative and adjudicative nature of the work performed by a CR." The Judge observed that the significant difference between the duties is further evidenced by the fact that that the SR position is classified as starting as a GS-8, whereas the CR position is classified as starting as a GS-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also found that, with the addition of these new responsibilities, the incumbent CRs underwent a training program that spanned from February to September and that the workload for the incumbent CRs increased. The Judge noted that the incumbent CRs "received no reduction in their CR workload by virtue of the newly promoted CRs, but they now had to perform the traditional SR duties previously performed by those promoted." The Judge concluded by noting that, under Authority precedent, "[a] change in conditions of employment that causes an employee to be assigned more work than that assigned prior to the change constitutes a greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change for those employees whose duties are substantially increased."[32]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not shown that the Judge erred in this regard.&#x2003;The Respondent's argument hinges on the assertion that "increased workloads alone are insufficient" to conclude that a change has greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impacts on conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1299"></span>This argument is unavailing for two reasons.&#x2003;First, as the Judge correctly noted in his decision,[34] Authority precedent explicitly holds that a change in conditions of employment that results in the effect of an increased workload is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[35] The Respondent attempts to distinguish the cases relied upon by the Judge in his decision. Specifically, the Respondent notes that, in addition to the increased workloads seen in those cases, there were other factors (such as shortened lunch breaks, office relocations, and increased overtime) that led the Authority to find that the impact of the changes in conditions of employment was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[36] However, the presence of these other factors in previous cases does not mean that their presence is <span class="Italic">required</span> in order to conclude that the effect of the change in conditions of employment is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Secondly, in addition to the increased workload, the Judge found that the change made by the Respondent affected the incumbent CRs' conditions of employment in large part because the Respondent imposed <span class="Italic">new duties</span> upon the CRs that consumed a sizeable amount of their work time. It is well-established that changes have a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact if they cause employees to assume a significant portion of new duties.[38] For example, the Authority has found that new duties consuming one to three hours a day were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>,[39] and that new duties consuming fifteen percent of an employee's workday were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[40] Given this precedent, the Respondent does not demonstrate that the Judge erred in his legal conclusion that the effect of the increase in new duties for CRs was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent">In 2004 FLRA changed preexisting law to require a threshold of a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>change in conditions of employment before an agency's obligation to bargain concerning either substantive changes in working conditions or the impact of substantive changes in working conditions brought about through the exercise of management rights. Earlier decisions imposed no <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> qualification on the bargaining obligation arising out of changes in employment conditions that were substantively negotiable, while the decisions placed that condition on bargaining over impact of substantive changes. <span class="Italic">SSA OHA Charleston and Ass'n of ALJs, IFPTE</span>, 59 FLRA 646, 649-55 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ass'n of ALJs v.

An opinion determined that the bargaining obligation, at any level, requires more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change, taking into account the nature and extent of either<span class="Italic"> </span>the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Change Did Not Give Rise to a Bargaining Obligation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to implementing a change in unit employees' conditions of employment, an agency must provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain under the Statute<span class="Italic">. United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999). The Statute sets forth the parties' duty to bargain in general terms, without applying any different standards depending on the nature of the change that an agency is making<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) and 7114. However, in administering the Statute, the Authority has long made a distinction between two types of changes: changes that involve the exercise of a reserved management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, and changes that do not involve the exercise of such a reserved management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency changes unit employees' conditions of employment by exercising a reserved management right, the substance of the decision is not itself subject to negotiation<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of HHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA 403, 407-08 (1986). Nonetheless, the agency has an obligation to bargain over the procedures to implement that decision and appropriate arrangements for unit employees adversely affected by that decision, if the resulting change has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, when an agency changes unit employees' conditions of employment by making a decision that does <span class="Italic">not</span> involve the exercise of a reserved management right, the Authority has applied a different standard under the Statute. Under current precedent, the change itself is viewed as substantively negotiable and the agency has an obligation to bargain over the change, no matter how trivial the change. For example, in <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 53 FLRA 1664 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Robins AFB</span>), the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The duty to bargain over negotiable conditions of employment is not eliminated by the degree to which unit employees are affected by a change in such conditions. Where an agency institutes a change in conditions of employment and the change is itself substantively negotiable, the extent of the impact of the change on unit employees is not relevant to whether an agency is obligated to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Robins AFB, </span>53 FLRA at 1669 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Stated otherwise, there is currently no threshold standard, like the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test, that must be met before an agency incurs an obligation to bargain when it makes a change in unit employees' conditions of employment that does not involve the exercise of a reserved management right.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Despite the fact that different standards currently apply for determining the existence of a bargaining obligation depending on whether the change involves the exercise of a reserved management right, no such distinction is made in the application of the Authority's "covered by" doctrine<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1017-19 (1993). Regardless of whether a change involves or does not involve the exercise of a reserved management right, an agency does not have an obligation to bargain before making the change if the subject matter is "covered by" the parties' collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Precedent Under Executive Order 11491 and Under the National Labor Relations Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Statute sets forth the parties' duty to bargain in general terms, without applying any different standards depending on the nature of the<span class="Italic"> </span>change that an agency is making<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) and 7114. The same was true under &#x00A7; 11 of Executive Order 11491, which governed the Federal labor management relations program prior to the enactment of the Statute.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Section 11 of the Order provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;An agency and a labor organization that has been accorded exclusive recognition, through appropriate representatives, shall meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions, so far as may be appropriate under applicable laws and regulations, including policies set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual, published agency policies and regulations, a national or other controlling agreement at a higher level in the agency, and this Order. They may negotiate an agreement, or any question arising thereunder; determine appropriate techniques, consistent with section 17 of this Order, to assist in such negotiation; and execute a written agreement or memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(b)&#x2003;In prescribing regulations relating to personnel policies and practices and working conditions, an agency shall have due regard for the obligation imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. However, the obligation to meet and confer does not include matters with respect to the mission of an agency; its budget; its organization; the number of employees; and the numbers, types, and grades of positions or employees assigned to an organizational unit, work project or tour of duty; the technology of performing its work; or its internal security practices. This does not preclude the parties from negotiating agreements providing appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the impact of realignment of work forces or technological change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense, Air Nat'l Guard, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard, Camp Mabry, Austin, Tex.</span>, 6 A/SLMR 591, A/SLMR No. 738 (1976) (<span class="Italic">DOD, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard</span>), the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations concluded that an agency had no obligation under &#x00A7; 11(a) of the Executive Order to notify and bargain with a union prior to the agency's issuance of a memorandum regarding a ban on the consumption of alcohol. In so concluding, the Assistant Secretary found that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]gency management's control of the consumption of alcoholic <span id="Page_1300"></span>beverages at government facilities does not fall within the ambit of those personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions which are contemplated by Section 11(a) of the Order. Section 11(a) describes the limited areas which are subject to the bargaining obligation on the part of agencies and exclusive representatives. In my view, it is not intended to embrace every issue which is of interest to agencies and exclusive representatives and which indirectly may affect employees. Rather, Section 11(a) encompasses those matters which materially affect, and have a substantial impact on, personnel policies, practices, and general working conditions. I do not consider a restriction on the consumption of alcohol on a government facility to reach such a level of importance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 592. In sum, the Assistant Secretary found that not every change in a substantively negotiable matter gave rise to a duty to bargain over the change; rather, the Assistant Secretary applied a threshold standard under which only those changes that materially affected and had a substantial impact on conditions of employment gave rise to a duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 2 FLRA 238 (1979) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>), a case decided under the Executive Order, the Authority adopted the Judge's findings and conclusions, including the Judge's application of the "substantial impact" standard as set forth above in <span class="Italic">DOD, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard</span>. The Authority concluded that the agency did not violate the Executive Order by unilaterally changing the location of flexitime sign-in/sign-out sheets, since the change "did not have any substantial impact on personnel policies, practices or general working conditions." <span class="Italic">SSA, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 2 FLRA at 239.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A similar threshold standard has been applied under the National Labor Relations Act by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). The NLRB has consistently adhered to the principle that unilateral changes in conditions of employment that are mandatory subjects of bargaining do not constitute a breach of the bargaining obligation unless the unilateral change "amount[s] to a material, substantial, and a significant one[.]" <span class="Italic">Peerless Food Products, Inc.</span>, 236 N.L.R.B. 161, 161 (1978) (<span class="Italic">Peerless</span>)<span class="Italic">. See also,</span> <span class="Italic">Nynex Corp.</span>, 338 N.L.R.B. No. 78, slip op. at 4 (2002); <span class="Italic">Golden Stevedoring Co.</span>, 335 N.L.R.B. No. 37, slip op. at 6 (2001); <span class="Italic">Millard Processing Services Inc.</span>, 310 N.L.R.B. 421, 425 (1993); <span class="Italic">Taino Paper Co.</span>, 290 N.L.R.B. 975, 978 (1988);<span class="Italic"> Angelica Healthcare Svs. Group</span>, 284 N.L.R.B. 844, 853 (1987);<span class="Italic"> United Technologies Corp.</span>, 278 N.L.R.B. 308 (1986);<span class="Italic"> Rust Craft Broadcasting of New York</span>, 225 N.L.R.B. 327 (1976). As the dates of the cited cases indicate, this principle was in effect both at the time of the enactment of the Statute as well as consistently thereafter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, at the time of the enactment of the Statute in 1978, both the precedent under the Executive Order as well as that under the NLRA mandated the use of a threshold standard that had to be met before a change by management in substantively negotiable matters gave rise to a duty to bargain over the change itself. In light of both Authority and judicial precedent discussing Congressional awareness of comparable provisions under the Executive Order and the NLRA and their administrative interpretations, and in the absence of any explicit indication in the Statute to strike a different course than that which was already established under the Executive Order and the private sector, it would seem appropriate to conclude that Congress was aware of the use of a threshold standard that had to be met before a change by management in substantively negotiable matters gave rise to a duty to bargain over the change itself, and that Congress intended to continue the use of such a standard in these cases.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1192 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (decisions of the Assistant Secretary under Executive Order 11491 were incorporated into the Statute by &#x00A7; 7135(b) of the Statute, and in the absence of Congressional dissatisfaction with the prior application or interpretation of a similar provision, Assistant Secretary decisions were to be given the same deference by the Authority as Authority decisions; further, "[a]t a minimum, the FLRA must acknowledge the precedent and provide a reason for departure, just as it must when it reappraises its own precedent."); <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 55 FLRA 254, 259 (1999) (Authority stated that "Congress indicated that it expected continuity of administration from the Executive Order to the Statute," and noted particularly that the "duty to bargain under the Executive Order and the Statute is virtually identical"); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222, </span>54 FLRA 1267, 1279 (1998) (Authority held that it was well established that "when there are comparable provisions under the Statute and the NLRA, decisions of the NLRB and the courts interpreting the NLRA have a high degree of relevance to similar circumstances under the Statute") (citations omitted).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority initially applied the "substantial impact" standard, developed by the Assistant Secretary under the Executive Order, in a case where the agency had no obligation to bargain under the Statute because the change related to the method used by the agency to fill a supervisory, non-bargaining unit position.

<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Cases Where the Agency's Change Did Not Involve the Exercise of a Reserved Management Right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Army Reserve Components Personnel and Admin. Center, St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 19 FLRA 290 (1985) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span>), the Authority addressed a claim that an agency did not have a duty to bargain over a substantively negotiable matter under the Statute--that is, one <span class="Italic">not</span> involving the exercise of a reserved management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.[10] There, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With regard to the Respondent's contention that the change in break, periods had no substantial impact on working conditions, it is the Authority'<span class="Italic">s </span>view that where, as here, the decision to make a change was itself negotiable, the question is whether the statutory obligation to notify and negotiate with the exclusive representative concerning the change was fulfilled, not the extent of impact of any unilateral change in conditions of employment upon the unit employees. This latter inquiry is appropriate when the bargaining obligation of management is limited to procedures and appropriate arrangements pursuant to section 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Jacksonville, Fl</span>, 15 FLRA No. 187 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;No submission from the parties or the <span class="Italic">amici</span> in this case cites any earlier decision in which the Authority considered a claim that an agency did not have a duty to bargain over a substantively negotiable matter and addressed the applicable standard under the Statute. However, in cases prior to <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span>, we note that the Authority had found that management had a duty to bargain over changes in a substantively negotiable matter involving starting and quitting times for bargaining unit employees without setting forth any applicable standard or rationale for such findings<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of Health and Human Serv., Soc. Sec. Admin., Baltimore, Md.</span>, 16 FLRA <span id="Page_1301"></span>674, 675 (1984);<span class="Italic"> Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Wash., D.C. and its Chicago Airways Facilities Sector</span>, 16 FLRA 479, 481 (1984);<span class="Italic"> Internal Revenue Serv., Los Angeles Dist.</span>, 10 FLRA 653, 655 (1982). Also, the Authority had made similar findings involving management's duty to bargain over changes in other substantively negotiable matters<span class="Italic">. See INS</span>, 16 FLRA at 1008 (Authority adopted Judge's findings that agency violated Statute by changing parking policies without affording Union the opportunity to bargain over changes); <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, 15 FLRA 589, 590 (1984) (Authority found that agency violated the Statute by not affording Union opportunity to bargain over change in access to microwave ovens free of charge by unit employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span>, 19 FLRA at 292-93. However, in articulating this standard, the Authority did not provide any explanation for its view that where the decision to make a change was itself substantively negotiable, no examination of the extent of the change's impact on unit employees was necessary in order to determine whether the agency had violated its duty to bargain. Similarly, the Authority did not refer to either the Assistant Secretary's decision in <span class="Italic">DOD, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard</span> or the Authority's own decision under the Executive Order in <span class="Italic">SSA, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>, and consequently provided no explanation for departing from the threshold standard applied in those cases. Such a lack of explanation appears to be contrary to the admonition of the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> that, "[a]t a minimum, the FLRA must acknowledge the precedent [of the Assistant Secretary under the Executive Order] and provide a reason for departure, just as it must when it reappraises its own precedent." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1192.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In subsequent cases where the agency's decision did not involve the exercise of a reserved management right, the Authority has continued to adhere to this standard, but has not explained <span class="Italic">why</span> the extent of the impact of the change on unit employees is not relevant in determining whether the agency has an obligation to bargain<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Robins AFB, </span>53 FLRA at 1669<span class="Italic">; 92 Bomb Wing Fairchild Air Force Base, Spokane, Wash.</span>, 50 FLRA 701, 704 (1995)<span class="Italic">; United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.,</span> 44 FLRA 988, 994 (1992); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Williams AFB, Chandler, Ariz.</span>, 38 FLRA 549 (1990); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org.</span>, 37 FLRA 392, 396 (1990); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Serv. and Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 30 FLRA 922, 926 (1988).[11] Although the Authority has continued to make the distinction in U.S. Army Reserve between substantively negotiable changes, where the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard has not been applied, and changes that are not substantively negotiable, where the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard has been applied, the rationale for this distinction is not apparent either from the Statute itself or from the Authority case law discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;A possible reason for the lack of an explanation of the rationale for the standard is that, unlike the instant case, the correctness of the standard was not challenged in the cited cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;The Standard to be Applied When an Agency Makes a Change That Does Not Involve the Exercise of a Reserved Management Right</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case before us presents the first instance in which a party has explicitly requested the Authority to revisit this precedent and to apply the same standard to both situations<span class="Italic">. Cf. Robins AFB</span>, 53 FLRA at 1669 n.5 (The Authority noted that although the respondent in that case viewed the effect of the change at issue as insignificant, the respondent had "not questioned Authority precedent that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine applies only to impact and implementation bargaining, and [the Authority] decline[d] to reexamine this precedent <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the case law set forth above, it is not clear why the Authority departed from the threshold standard set forth both in the Executive Order and by the NLRB in cases involving a change by management in substantively negotiable matters. As stated above, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span> did not refer to either <span class="Italic">DOD, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard</span> or <span class="Italic">SSA, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>, and consequently provided no explanation for departing from the threshold standard applied in those cases. Similarly, when the Authority set forth the standard in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span>, it made no reference to <span class="Italic">Peerless</span> and related NLRB precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this latter respect, it is not apparent why the NLRB's practice as set forth in <span class="Italic">Peerless</span> was not discussed in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Reserve</span>. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA at 406 n.1, the Authority highlighted <span class="Italic">Peerless</span> and the NLRB's precedent in the context of explaining the Authority's use of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard to determine whether an agency has an obligation to bargain over the <span class="Italic">impact and implementation</span> of changes in conditions of employment. As relevant here, the Authority reasoned in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority must take care that its adjudicative processes not be unnecessarily burdened with cases that do not serve to bring meaning and purpose to the Federal labor-management relations program. While we seek to ensure that the rights of agencies, unions, and employees under the Statute are protected in situations involving changes in conditions of employment, we must also seek to discharge our responsibilities in a fashion that promotes <span class="Italic">meaningful</span> bilateral negotiations. Interpreting the Statute to require bargaining over every single management action, no matter how slight the impact of that action, does not serve those aims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 406 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree fully with this reasoning.&#x2003;Moreover, in our view, the above rationale applies equally as well to changes in conditions of employment that are substantively negotiable. No interests are served by requiring "bargaining over every single management action, no matter how slight the impact of that action[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The furtherance of meaningful bilateral negotiations in support of the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government is best served by applying the same standard irrespective of whether a management change concerns the exercise of a management right or the exercise of a substantively negotiable matter. The application of the same standard is warranted in both circumstances and is consistent with the requirement in &#x00A7; 7101(b) that the provisions of the Statute "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we believe that the appropriate threshold standard to apply in both circumstances is the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard that the Authority has developed and applied over the years. Under this standard, as noted above, an agency has an obligation to bargain over the procedures to implement a decision and appropriate arrangements for unit employees adversely affected by that decision, if the resulting change has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. See DHHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA at 407-08. In <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In order to determine whether a change in conditions of employment requires bargaining in this and future cases, the pertinent facts and circumstances presented in each case will be carefully examined. In examining the record, we will place principal emphasis on such general areas of consideration as the nature and extent of the effect or reasonably foreseeable effect of the change on conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. Equitable considerations will also be taken into account in balancing the various interests involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As to the number of employees involved, this factor will not be a controlling consideration. It will be applied primarily to expand rather than limit the number of situations where bargaining will be required. For example, we may find that a change does not require bargaining. However, a similar change involving hundreds of employees could, in appropriate circumstances, give rise to a bargaining obligation. The parties' bargaining history will be subject to similar limited application. As to the size of the bargaining unit, this factor will no longer be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either<span class="Italic"> </span>the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 913 (2000)<span class="Italic"> </span>(<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority addresses what a respondent knew, or should have known, at the time of the change<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">VA Med. Ctr., Phoenix, Ariz.</span>, 47 FLRA 419, 423 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This standard provides ample guidance to the parties to determine when a bargaining obligation is incurred and ensures that bargaining takes place in a manner that furthers the purposes set forth in &#x00A7; 7101 of the Statute. The consistent application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard in all instances in which an agency seeks to change unit employees' conditions of employment will assist parties in conducting their collective bargaining relationship effectively so as to "facilitate[&#8197;] and encourage[&#8197;] the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment" and to "facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. Accordingly, we will apply the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard in this and future cases to determine whether an agency has a duty to bargain in situations in which it changes unit employees' conditions of employment.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;We note two additional points that remain unaffected by our decision. First, under the "covered by" doctrine, an agency does not have an obligation to bargain before making a change if the subject matter of the change is "covered by" the parties' collective bargaining agreement, regardless of whether the change involves or does not involve the exercise of a reserved management right.<span class="Italic"> See </span>note 6, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Second, even if an agency does not have a duty to bargain over a change, there may well be situations where an agency may decide, for any of a variety of reasons, to work collaboratively with the exclusive representative of the unit employees regarding the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;Application of the Standard to This Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the<span class="Italic"> de minimis</span> standard to this case, we find that the effect, <span id="Page_1302"></span>or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change in the number of reserved parking spaces was not more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Application of this standard is warranted in this case, just as application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard was warranted in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA at 408, when it was first set forth for cases involving the exercise of a reserved management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the change in the number of reserved parking spaces, the record establishes that the unit employees had access to parking in the facility at their place of employment; they did not have to pay for that parking; they had "in and out" privileges; and they had no difficulty in finding spaces in which to park, either at the beginning of the workday or during the workday itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the change in the number of reserved parking spaces, the record establishes that the unit employees have had access to parking at their place of employment; they have not had to pay for that parking; they have had "in and out" privileges; and they have had no difficulty in finding spaces in which to park, either at the beginning of the workday or during the workday itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record in this case shows that the change in the number of reserved parking spaces has had only one impact on the unit employees: the ALJs have parked in some different parking spaces. Moreover, nothing in the record establishes that the Respondent knew, or should have known, that there would be any additional reasonably foreseeable effect at the time of the change. Accordingly, the change in this case has not been shown to be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, and, therefore, the Respondent did not have a duty to bargain over the change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VIII. Order</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint is dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">On appeal <span class="Italic">SSA </span>was affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Ass'n of ALJs v. FLRA</span>, 397 F.3d 957, 959-64 (D.C. Cir. 2005), concluding that FLRA could legitimately decide to impose a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard on duty to bargain issues concerning substantive matters of negotiation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue, which we resolve with deference to the Authority because it is charged with administration of the Statute, is whether "the Congress has taken a position so rigid that it will not admit of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exemption." <span class="Italic">Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA</span>, 82 F.3d 451, 466 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In this regard, as the Authority points out, the Congress has specifically directed that "[t]he provisions of [the Statute] should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101. In light of this pragmatic direction, we hold the Authority's interpretation of the Statute not to require bargaining over trivia is neither contrary to the text nor unreasonable in light of its purpose. Because the Authority here applied the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to a truly insignificant change in the ALJs' conditions of employment, we deny the Union's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In October 1999, each of the six ALJs employed in the Social Security Administration's Office of Hearings and Appeals in Charleston, South Carolina was assigned a reserved parking space. One year later the agency, refusing the Union's request to bargain over the matter, unilaterally reassigned four of those spaces, leaving only two reserved spaces for the six ALJs to share. All six ALJs were still allowed free, unreserved parking in the same garage, and space was always available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority, and the General Counsel issued a complaint alleging the SSA had violated the Statute by refusing to bargain over a substantively negotiable change in a condition of employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) &#x0026; (5). After a hearing, an ALJ for the Authority upheld the complaint and ordered the agency to reinstate the ALJs' parking privileges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so doing, the ALJ followed longstanding practice with respect to a change in working conditions that was "substantively negotiable"--meaning not within one of the "management rights" enumerated in &#x00A7; 7106: "[T]he extent of the impact of the change on unit employees has not been a factor or element in the analysis of whether an agency is obligated to bargain." On the other hand, an agency was not (and is not) obligated to bargain over the "impact and implementation" of a change it could make as a matter of management right unless the change "has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect on the unit employees' conditions of employment." Here the ALJ volunteered that "if [SSA] were only obligated to bargain [over] impact and implementation, there might be a grave doubt that the impact was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SSA filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision, arguing "the Authority should apply the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>doctrine that has been used for impact and implementation bargaining to changes that are substantively negotiable." Recognizing that "the issue raised by the Agency...[was] likely to be of concern to the federal sector labor-management relations community in general," the Authority published in the Federal Register a call for <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs addressed to the following questions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What standard should the Authority apply in determining an agency's statutory obligation to bargain when an agency institutes changes in conditions of employment that are substantively negotiable? Why? Should the Authority eliminate the distinction between substantively negotiable changes, where the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>standard has not been applied, and changes that are not substantively negotiable, where the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>standard has been applied? Why?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Briefs were filed by three unions representing employees of the Government and by the Departments of Defense and of Labor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the resulting order, now under review, the Authority reversed the ALJ and repudiated its prior practice, noting that it had never "explained <span class="Italic">why </span>the extent of the impact of the change is not relevant in determining whether the agency has an obligation to bargain." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Charleston, S.C.</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. No. 118, 2004 WL 349896, Slip at 19 (Feb. 19, 2004) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">Charleston OHA</span>). This being the "first instance in which a party ha[d] explicitly requested the Authority...to apply the same standard to both situations," the Authority could find no reason to limit its recognition of the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception to "impact and implementation" bargaining, as to which it had long ago explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority must take care that its adjudicative processes not be unnecessarily burdened with cases that do not serve to bring meaning and purpose to the Federal labor-management relations program. While we seek to ensure that the rights of agencies, unions, and employees under the Statute are protected in situations involving changes in conditions of employment, we must also seek to discharge our responsibilities in a fashion that promotes <span class="Italic">meaningful </span>bilateral negotiations. Interpreting the Statute to require bargaining over every single management action, no matter how slight the impact of that action, does not serve those aims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, SSA</span>, 24 F.L.R.A. 403, 406 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, "in the absence of any explicit indication in the Statute," and in light of its duty to interpret the Statute "in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b), the Authority concluded the Statute does not require an agency to bargain over a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change in conditions of employment. In so holding, the Authority noted that a similar standard prevailed both under Executive Order 11491, which had governed labor-management relations in the federal Government prior to enactment of the Statute in 1978, <span class="Italic">see Dep't of Defense, Air Nat'l Guard, Tex. Air Nat'l Guard, Camp Mabry, Austin, Tex.</span>, 6 A/SLMR 591 No. 738 (1976) (obligation to bargain "encompasses those matters which materially affect, and have a substantial impact on, personnel policies, practices, and general working conditions"), and under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 151 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, which governs labor management relations in the private sector, <span class="Italic">see Peerless Food Prods., Inc</span>., 236 N.L.R.B. 161 (1978) (obligation to bargain where unilateral change "amount[s] to a material, substantial, and significant one").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard to this case, the Authority concluded the SSA's reduction by four in the number of reserved parking spaces assigned to the six ALJs was indeed a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change in the conditions of their employment. Accordingly, it dismissed the complaint and the Union petitioned for review.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;The Union argued before the Authority that the case was moot because (1) the Charleston OHA relocated to a "new site [that] has unreserved parking available for all employees and, unlike the [previous location], does not have any reserved parking spaces at all"; and (2) "the bargaining impasse between the parties on the issue of parking was resolved by a decision and order of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) issued during the pendency of this case." The Union no longer argues mootness, but the court has considered the issue nonetheless, as it is obligated to do so <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. <span class="Italic">See Iron Arrow Honor Soc'y v. Heckler</span>, 464 U.S. 67, 70 (1983); <span class="Italic">Mine Reclamation Corp. v. FERC</span>, 30 F.3d 1519, 1522 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We hold the case is not moot. Although retrospective relief--reinstatement of the ALJs' reserved parking privileges--may no longer be available, an order of the Authority "imposes a continuing obligation; and the [Authority] is entitled to have the resumption of the unfair labor practice barred by an enforcement decree." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Raytheon Co</span>., 398 U.S. 25, 27 (1970). Further, as we explained in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 777 F.2d 751, 753 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1985),</p>
<p class="noindent-3">In addition to issuing a cease and desist order upon a finding of an unfair labor practice, the FLRA is authorized to order "such other action as will carry out the purpose" of the Federal Labor-Management Relations Act. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7)(D); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.29. This "other action" may include the posting of a notice indicating that an agency has been found to have committed an unfair labor practice and that it has been ordered to cease committing such practices in the future....&#8197;The existence of this additional remedy...establishes that a live controversy still <span id="Page_1303"></span>exists between the parties and that this case is therefore not moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We review the Authority's interpretation of the Statute under the two-step framework of <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). We first consider whether the "Congress has spoken directly" to the question whether an agency must bargain over changes in conditions of employment with a merely <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect upon unit employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 842-43 &#x0026; n.9 (1984). If the court, "employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843 n.9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute grants "[e]ach employee...the right...to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2), where "'conditions of employment' means personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise, affecting working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14). Section 7106 enumerates several "management rights" that function as exceptions to the duty to bargain. Here the parties agree that reserved parking was a "condition of employment" for the ALJs and that the SSA's reduction in the number of spaces assigned to them was not a matter of "management right."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>step one the parties each advance a "traditional tool of statutory construction." The Union argues that, because the Statute enumerates several exceptions to the duty to bargain but nowhere mentions a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception, the court should infer that the Congress did not intend that there be a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception; <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>. The Authority, for its part, argues that a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception, not having been expressly foreclosed, is implicit in the Statute as in all rules of law; <span class="Italic">de minimis non curat lex</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the enumeration of management rights in the Statute precludes a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to the duty to bargain fails on two counts. First, although it is true, as the Union says, the Authority has no inherent power to "confer[&#8197;] on federal agencies a new management right that Congress...did not contemplate," <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA</span>, 853 F.2d 986, 992 (1988), that is not what it has done. A <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change is not a proper subject of bargaining not because management has a "right" to make it but because it has no appreciable effect upon working conditions. Second, we have repeatedly recognized that a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception is generally not express; rather, it is "inherent in most statutory schemes," by implication. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. EPA</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Categorical exemptions may...be permissible "as an exercise of agency power, inherent in most statutory schemes, to overlook circumstances that in context may fairly be considered <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>."...&#8197;The ability to create a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exemption "is not an ability to depart from the statute, but rather a tool to be used in implementing the legislative design."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As long as the Congress has not been "extraordinarily rigid" in drafting the statute..."there is likely a basis for an implication of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> authority to provide [an] exemption when the burdens of regulation yield a gain of trivial or no value."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">82 F.3d 451, 466 (D.C. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">quoting Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, </span>636 F.2d 323, 360 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Unless it has been "extraordinarily rigid" in expressing itself to the contrary, that is, the Congress is always presumed to intend that "pointless expenditures of effort" be avoided. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, the Union's argument, based as it is upon the venerable and useful implication captured by the <span class="Italic">expressio unius </span>maxim, does not justify the conclusion that the Congress has spoken directly to the question here at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We proceed accordingly to consider under <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>step two, 467 U.S. at 843, whether the Authority's inference that there is a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to the duty to bargain is a permissible construction of the Statute. The Union argues the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is contrary to the Congress's having found:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[E]xperience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to...bargain collectively...safeguards the public interest...contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and...facilitates and encourages the amicable settlement of disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1). In light of this finding, the Union argues, "the erection of barriers to collective bargaining thwarts legislative intent."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the finding in &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1), nor any other provision of the Statute, however, gives any indication "the Congress has taken a position so [extraordinarily] rigid that it will not admit of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exemption." <span class="Italic">Envtl. Def. Fund, Inc</span>., 82 F.3d at 466. On the contrary, the Congress took the unusual step of prescribing a practical and flexible rule of construction--to wit, the Statute "should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b)--that clearly invites the Authority to exercise its judgment, as it has done in the order under review. Effectiveness and efficiency in government can hardly be thought to require bargaining over truly insignificant conditions of employment. As the Authority reasonably concluded, "No interests are served by requiring bargaining over every single management action, no matter how slight the impact."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's attempt to distinguish "impact bargaining" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) from bargaining over substantively negotiable conditions of employment is unpersuasive. According to the Union, "the concept of adverse impact...is grounded squarely in the statutory language...but has no rational bearing on substantive bargaining cases." The Union reasons as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The existence of some level of impact on bargaining unit employees is...a <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> of a union's right to engage in impact bargaining. In contrast, in cases involving substantively negotiable matters, the Statute confers a right to engage in collective bargaining without reference to the existence of impact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), however, does not contain the word "impact"; it requires bargaining over "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely <span class="Italic">affected </span>by the exercise" of any management right. More important, &#x00A7; 7102(2), which governs so-called substantive bargaining, invokes a cognate by referencing "conditions of employment," defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) as "personnel polices, practices, and matters...<span class="Italic">affecting </span>working conditions." The Congress thus having predicated the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and under &#x00A7; 11 7102(2) upon the same notion, namely an <span class="Italic">effect </span>upon employees, we cannot deem unreasonable, as the Union suggests, the Authority's conclusion that "application of the same standard is warranted in both circumstances." Indeed, the Union's argument that "some level of impact"--that is, "effect"--"is a <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span> of a union's right to engage in...bargaining" provides a persuasive defense of the Authority's uniform <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception, although the Authority does not make that point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's invocation of the legislative history of the Statute is no more persuasive than its argument from the text. The legislative history quoted by the Union indicates the Congress intended "that the listed management rights...be narrowly construed exceptions to the general obligation to bargain...and that section 7106 be read to favor collective bargaining whenever there is a doubt as to the negotiability of a subject or proposal." 124 Cong. Rec. 29,198 (1978) (statement of Rep. Ford). As the Authority points out, this case does not involve the interpretation of the scope of &#x00A7; 7106; the parties agree that the SSA was not exercising a management right when it reduced the number of parking spaces reserved for ALJs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we think the Union's predictions about the practical consequences of the Authority's decision are unduly dire. First, the Union warns the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception will "upset[&#8197;] the balance at the bargaining table" and will "seriously damage[&#8197;] the union's collective bargaining efforts." This concern is misplaced in view of the narrow limits of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, for the Authority will bear the burden before this court of showing that any particular application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Alabama Power</span>, 636 F.2d at 360 ("Determination of when matters are truly <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> naturally will turn on the assessment of particular circumstances, and the agency will bear the burden of making the required showing").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union predicts the Authority's decision will "spawn significant confusion and extensive litigation." Although there is little indication the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception for "impact bargaining" has had such an untoward effect, we trust that if administration of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception for substantive bargaining becomes more burdensome than would be the alternative of bargaining over trivia, then the Authority will conclude the interests of "effective and efficient Government" are better served by dispensing with the exception. It is, of course, for the Authority, rather than for this court, to make that judgment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We turn now to whether the management action at issue in this case, "in context may fairly be considered <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>." <span class="Italic">Alabama Power</span>, 636 F.2d at 360. The record establishes, and the Union does not dispute, that when the SSA reassigned four of the six parking spaces previously reserved for ALJs, parking for the ALJs was still free, in the same garage, and always available. Indeed, the Union, standing upon the principle that it and the employees it represents should be allowed to decide what is worth bargaining over, does not claim the change had any material effect upon the ALJs. Accordingly, we agree with the Authority that the difference was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is <span class="Italic">Denied</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> test, is summarized by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Wage &#x0026; Investment Div. and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 235, 239-40 (2011), reviewing an arbitration award involving assignment of "inventory" (administrative duty) days:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As relevant here, an agency is not required to bargain over the impact and implementation of a change if the change has a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect. <span id="Page_1304"></span><span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 913 (2000). In assessing whether the effect of a change is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority "looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Id.; U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 54 FLRA 914, 919 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the Authority considers five factors when it ascertains whether a change had a more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect. However, the Authority no longer applies that approach; rather, it utilizes the framework set forth above. <span class="Italic">See DHHS, </span>24 FLRA at 407-08 (Authority stated it would look to effects or reasonably foreseeable effects of a change rather than the five factors). Accordingly, we do not apply the five factor analysis to our review of the Arbitrator's conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Admin., W. L.A. Med. Ctr., L.A., Cal., </span>24 FLRA 714, 717-18 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency need not bargain a change because it is <span class="Italic">de minimis,</span> the agency does not commit a ULP by failing to provide advance notice to the union of the change (a component of the bargaining obligation), as FLRA noted when it reviewed an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 26 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 650, 653 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that, based on the evidence, "it [wa]s abundantly clear" that moving the employee to the appeals office had only a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact on bargaining unit employees. The Arbitrator found that: (1) no bargaining unit employee was asked to move or was displaced; (2) no change was made in the configuration of the work place, office furnishings, or lease; and (3) "nothing was taken away" from the bargaining unit by the Agency's decision. The Arbitrator also found that "unrefuted testimony" showed that the appeals office had no need for the "vacant work station for any anticipated new hires" or for its "own use at that time." Moreover, the Arbitrator found no support for the Union's claim that the employee's new location may allow him to view appeals' case files.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not argue that the Arbitrator's findings are based on a nonfact, but merely asserts that the evidence shows that the impact of the employee's relocation on bargaining unit employees was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. The Union has not provided any basis for setting aside the Arbitrator's findings. The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, support his conclusion that the impact or reasonably foreseeable impact of the employee's relocation on bargaining unit employees was <span class="Italic">de minimis. See, e.g., IRS</span>, 64 FLRA at 977 (upholding arbitrator's finding that change in conditions of employment was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that that the Agency was not required to provide the Union with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over the matter, and the award is not contrary to law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Leavenworth and NFFE Local 1765</span>, 60 FLRA 315, 318 (2004), determined that a change in working conditions adversely affecting the earnings of even a few employees was not <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain, if the change will have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.</span>, 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999). In applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment.<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 56 FLRA 906, 913 (2000). In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority addresses what a respondent knew, or should have known, at the time of the change. <span class="Italic">See VA Med. Ctr., Phoenix, Ariz., </span>47 FLRA 419, 423 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Well-established precedent holds that changes in conditions of employment that adversely affect an employee's ability to earn overtime and differential pay is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp</span>., 59 FLRA 48, 51 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting in part as to the bargaining order) (citing<span class="Italic"> Customs Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 1129) (Chair Segal dissenting) (<span class="Italic">PBGC</span>). For example, in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the respondent changed the hours of work of an employee and, as a result, he and another employee lost the opportunity to work overtime. The Authority found that "the change in shifts and tours of duty had more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on the employees' ability to earn overtime, night differential and Sunday premium pay." <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 1129.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that the foregoing established precedent is inapplicable because in those cases, the employees lost shift differentials due to changes in their established tours of duty, whereas RN B did not have a change in an established tour of duty because<span class="Italic"> </span>she<span class="Italic"> </span>was not guaranteed weekend hours. However, the Respondent's argument is not supported by Authority precedent. In this regard, the Authority has never indicated in any way that whether a loss results from a change in established schedules is relevant. Indeed, the loss at issue in PBGC did not occur as a result of any change in tours of duty; instead the loss resulted from an organizational realignment. <span class="Italic">See PBGC, </span>59 FLRA at 51. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv.</span>, 19 FLRA 1155 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>), the loss of overtime that the Authority found more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>resulted from the agency's decision to eliminate a certain aspect of the employees' work, such that the employees were no longer "routinely called upon to perform overtime work as they had been in the past." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 19 FLRA at 1156. The loss of overtime had nothing to do with any change in established tours of duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the lost overtime in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> had not previously been guaranteed as part of the former shift. Rather, the judge found that employees in that case had "frequently worked on overtime" whenever "an overtime assignment exist[ed.]" <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 1137, 1134. Similarly, as the Respondent expressly acknowledges, RN B "generally had a schedule...whereby she worked every other weekend" in her old unit. Therefore, like the employees in <span class="Italic">PBGC</span> and <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, RN B lost the opportunity to earn overtime. Authority precedent requires a conclusion that the loss is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">See PBGC</span>, 59 FLRA at 51; <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 1129; <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 19 FLRA at 1158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument that the reassignment was only temporary, lasting only 120 days, does not lead us to reach a different conclusion. In this regard, the Judge found that RN B's reassignment lasted more than 120 days and eventually became permanent. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 10 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge found that RN B lost $1,600 in shift differentials, she concluded that "this single instance of impact" was not sufficient to find a violation. In so finding, the Judge erred. There is no dispute that, as a result of the reassignment, RN B lost the opportunity to work on weekends and, therefore, the opportunity to earn overtime pay. There is no dispute that this was a reasonably foreseeable effect of the change because RN B's new unit was not open on weekends. Thus, the effect of the change was not<span class="Italic"> de minimis </span>and the Respondent violated the Statute as alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in practice permitting access to agency computers by border patrol agents assigned to administrative duty while investigations into those agents' conduct exceeded the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold in a ULP case, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, 67 FLRA 46, 49 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Authority applies the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine, it looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect of the change on bargaining&#8209;unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 355th MSG/CC, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.,</span> 64 FLRA 85, 89 (2009) (citing <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Phx., Ariz.,</span> 47 FLRA 419, 423 (1993)). Further, an analysis of whether a change is <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>does not focus primarily on the actual effects of the change, but rather on a change's reasonably foreseeable effects. <span class="Italic">E.g., Air Force</span>, 64 FLRA at 173; <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. (Wash. D.C.) &#x0026; U.S. Customs Serv. Ne. Region (Bos., Mass.)</span>, 29 FLRA 891, 899 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge focused primarily on the change's actual effects, finding that, although the agents' "ability to receive certain information may have been curtailed,...there was no evidence that [they] were <span class="Italic">actually </span>affected in any way by this." However, the Judge neglected to consider adequately the change's reasonably foreseeable effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the reasonably foreseeable effects of the change in the agents' computer access are taken into consideration, the record supports a conclusion that the effects of the change are more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. It is not disputed that access to the Respondent's computers and computer systems is an integral part of its communication system. Similarly, it is not disputed that the Respondent uses the system to communicate a great deal of critical agency and employment--related information that would be crucial to any employee--even an employee on administrative duty. Such information includes, among other things, information concerning training opportunities, detail opportunities, promotion opportunities, transfer opportunities, collateral&#8209;duty opportunities, agency-policy changes, and federal&#8209;employee benefits such as the open season for benefit applications. Moreover, it is not contested that the Respondent's computer systems are the Union's primary means of communication with bargaining&#8209;unit employees, particularly given the employees' geographical distribution and shift work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Undisputed evidence in the record also demonstrates that the Respondent provides no uniform, reliable procedures to ensure that the affected employees receive all necessary information and communications. Further, the Respondent does not dispute record evidence establishing that the Respondent does not advise the agents of the alleged alternative means from which they could obtain this information. This places the burden on the agents to find out whether any critical information has indeed been communicated to agency employees, and to find out the content of the information itself. The reasonably foreseeable effects of the situation created by the Respondent's change are significant. It is reasonably foreseeable that <span id="Page_1305"></span>agents on administrative duty will fail to receive at least some significant information and communications. For example, one of the agents in this case nearly missed an opportunity to participate in a dental plan because he was not notified of the health&#8209;benefit open season and its related deadlines. The only reason that the agent did not miss the deadline is that a co&#8209;worker, coincidentally, notified him of the open season one day prior to the closing deadline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record before us, and for the reasons discussed above, we find that the change at issue here--the denial of computer access to agents assigned to administrative duty--has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, Border &#x0026; Transp. Security Directorate and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 60 FLRA 943, 951-52 (2005), determined that the impact of a change in a firearms remedial training requirement was somewhat speculative, that there was no basis, given a long period of time when the training requirement was not used to remove an employee, to find that any impact was reasonably foreseeable. The conclusion was that the impact of the change was not more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. That decision was the subject of judicial review, with the result that the case was remanded to FLRA for further consideration, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council v. FLRA,</span> 446 F.3d 162, 164-67 (D.C. Cir. 2006):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claiming that INS committed unfair labor practices while revising the policy, the Union filed a charge with the FLRA in 2002. In the only claim germane to this petition, it asserted that the Bureau violated both statutory and contractual duties to provide notice and an opportunity to bargain over the reduction in remedial training hours. The FLRA General Counsel subsequently issued a complaint against the Bureau alleging violations of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ"), the Bureau argued that the reduction in remedial training hours would not have a greater-than-<span class="Italic">de-minimis</span> effect on working conditions. To prove greater-than-<span class="Italic">de-minimis</span> effect, the General Counsel called the Union's president to testify. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Admin. Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Charleston, S.C.,</span> 59 FLRA 646, 655, 2004 FLRA LEXIS 22 (2004) (placing burden of proof on General Counsel). According to the witness, the Bureau fired at least one BTO for firearms deficiency without providing the employee more than eight hours of remedial training. The witness also testified that the Bureau fired at least one nonbargaining-unit employee--under the same firearms policy--without granting eighty remedial training hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On this evidence, the ALJ found the effect of the hours reduction "somewhat speculative." Nevertheless, the ALJ concluded that evidence showing the Bureau fired even one BTO after granting only eight remedial training hours sufficed to exceed the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. Having found a greater-than-de-minimis effect, the ALJ held that the Bureau had violated both its statutory duty and its contractual duty under the MOU to give notice and bargain over the changes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau filed exceptions to the ALJ's ruling, and the FLRA reversed. In the Authority's view, the General Counsel failed to prove that the Bureau had fired any BTO solely for firearms deficiency without providing eighty remedial training hours. In addition, the Authority rejected all evidence related to nonbargaining-unit employees. Accordingly, the Authority held that the General Counsel did not prove greater-than-de-minimis effect, and it therefore concluded that the Bureau had no statutory duty to bargain over the policy revisions. The Authority also held that the absence of a statutory duty to bargain precluded a contractual duty under the MOU.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union timely petitions this court for review of the FLRA's order, challenging the Authority's application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception. The Union also argues that even if a change is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, an agency may still lawfully choose to bargain over such a change and that the Bureau was required to do so here in light of a provision in the MOU requiring the Bureau to bargain "to the fullest extent allowable under law." It has since conceded, however, that it waived this issue by failing to raise it before the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). Accordingly, we only address the reasonableness of the FLRA's application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception to the firearms policy revisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal law requires an agency to "negotiate in good faith" with its employees' chosen representative. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5). The employer's duty to bargain, however, extends only to bargainable issues, not including a range of matters labeled "management rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106; <span class="Italic">see also Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 437 F.3d 1248, 1249 (D.C. Cir. 2006). In addition to these explicit exceptions, the FLRA has interpreted the statute to include an unwritten <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception, and we have deferred to its interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Admin. Law Judges v. FLRA,</span> 365 U.S. App. D.C. 6, 397 F.3d 957, 959 (D.C. Cir. 2005) <span class="Italic">("AALJ").</span> Our deference, however, is not without limits: The FLRA has the burden before this court to "show [&#8197;] that any particular application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception is reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 963. Because the Authority has not carried that burden, we grant the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">AALJ,</span> "[a] <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> change is not a proper subject of bargaining not because management has a 'right' to make it but because it has no appreciable effect upon working conditions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 962. Accordingly, any policy change having an appreciable effect on working conditions cannot find shelter in the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception. Appreciable effects may surface not only through actual past effects but also through likely future effects. The FLRA recognizes these two avenues of inquiry in its <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception formula: "In assessing whether the effect of a decision on conditions of employment is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS,</span> 56 FLRA 906, 913, 2000 FLRA LEXIS 172 (2000) (citation omitted). Following this methodology, the Authority found that the firearms policy change had a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority noted "conflicting" testimony regarding whether the INS first, and the Bureau later, ever offered more than eight hours of remedial firearms training to any BTO under either the original or revised policy. The Authority suggested, however, that since 1996 the agency may have in practice used the same training policy that it adopted officially in 2002. Placing great weight on these years of practice, the Authority reasoned that any adverse effects from the eight-hour cap on remedial training should have manifested themselves during that span. The Authority found no actual adverse effects during the period after 1996 and therefore concluded that the official policy change in 2002 entailed no reasonably foreseeable effects either.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the Union contends that the policy change has caused actual adverse effects.&#x2003;According to unrefuted testimony, the Bureau terminated at least one BTO for firearms deficiency without offering the eighty remedial hours. The witness further testified that some nonbargaining-unit employees, subject to the same firearms policy, had also been terminated without receiving more than eight hours of remedial training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Without discrediting the witness's testimony, the FLRA gave it short shrift. Diminishing the importance of the testimony regarding the BTO's termination, the Authority found that the General Counsel failed to prove that firearms deficiency was the sole cause of the BTO's termination. The Authority placed even less weight on the nonbargaining-unit evidence, issuing a blanket exclusion: "Evidence of any impact on non-bargaining unit employees does not serve to establish an impact on bargaining unit employees." The Authority mishandled both pieces of testimony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite accepting the fact that the Bureau likely fired at least one firearms-deficient BTO without providing eighty remedial training hours, the Authority appeared to require a showing that the policy change constituted the sole cause for the termination. Such an evidentiary requirement would fundamentally change the nature of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception, which heretofore relieved the employer of any duty to bargain over "trivia." <span class="Italic">AALJ,</span> 397 F.3d at 959. But the specter of termination is no trivial matter. It is nonsensical to say that a termination, if due even in part to the policy change, does not constitute an "appreciable effect upon working conditions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's error runs deeper, however. Even if the Bureau terminated the BTO for other reasons, the evidence demonstrates the existence of reasonably foreseeable effects. The Authority accepted that at least one BTO--and perhaps some nonbargaining-unit employees--became eligible for termination despite not receiving more than eight remedial hours of firearms training. The fact that one employee became termination-eligible due to firearms deficiency makes the likelihood of a future termination much greater. The Bureau's policy change drastically reduced every employee's ability to remedy a firearms deficiency, thus increasing the likelihood that a deficient BTO will actually be terminated by the Bureau. This increased likelihood of termination, confirmed by a past occurrence, constitutes a reasonably foreseeable effect on working conditions. Accordingly, a greater-than-de-minimis effect exists when an employee has become eligible for termination due to a policy change.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also erred in its treatment of the testimony regarding the nonbargaining-unit employees. Although we generally do not presume to tell the Authority which evidence it should or should not find persuasive,<span class="Italic"> see </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c) (setting out "substantial evidence" standard), the complete exclusion of this evidence is baffling. The nonbargaining-unit employees worked for the same employer, followed the same firearms policy, and faced the same penalties for firearms deficiency. The policy change therefore would have struck a similar chord in both groups. The Authority already faced evidence that the Bureau terminated at least one BTO who failed to meet firearms standards. The terminations of similarly situated, nonbargaining-unit employees provide additional evidence of concrete effects and confirm the likelihood of future adverse effects to the bargaining unit. Again, having neither discredited the testimony nor given reasons for finding it unpersuasive, the Authority should not have discarded such evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More than one alarm bell should have alerted the Authority to the fact <span id="Page_1306"></span>that this policy revision had an appreciable effect on working conditions.&#x2003;When a policy change increases the likelihood of an employee's termination, it almost certainly rises above the level of trivia. In addition, the sheer magnitude of the policy change should have given the Authority pause. Because the Bureau trains BTOs initially for only eight hours, eighty remedial hours would have given laggards ten times that in additional training to cure the deficiency. Without consulting the Union, the Bureau unilaterally reduced that number by ninety percent, from eighty to eight. A change on that order alone--where the penalty may be termination--pushes the bounds of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AALJ,</span> we approved the FLRA's use of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception for a nearly seventy-percent reduction in reserved parking spaces. 397 F.3d at 960. But unreserved parking was plentiful and freely available, and improper parking would not lead to dismissal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 964. The same cannot be said in this case. Here, the Bureau did not replace the eighty remedial hours with an equivalent, and firearms deficiency would result in termination. This massive change had a reasonably foreseeable, greater-than-<span class="Italic">de-minimis</span> effect on working conditions. Because we find that the reduction in remedial training hours had an appreciable effect on working conditions, we conclude that the FLRA unreasonably applied the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>exception. In addition, because the Authority erroneously relied on the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> exception in determining that there was no violation of the MOU, we set aside its resolution of the Union's MOU claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the circuit court, FLRA determined the remedial training change to be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>in impact and directed a <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>remedy, <span class="Italic">DHS Boarder &#x0026; Transp. Security Directorate and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 63 FLRA 406, 407-08 (2009) (<span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> 63 FLRA 600 (2009)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain where the change will have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.,</span> 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999). Consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> the reduction of the number of remedial training hours for trainees had a greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Respondent's reduction in the number of remedial training hours was not substantively negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The extent to which an agency is required to bargain over changes in conditions of employment depends on the nature of the change.&#x2003;Specifically, a union may be entitled under the Statute to negotiate over the substance of the change. <span class="Italic">See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Bastrop, Tex.,</span> 55 FLRA 848, 852 (1999) (Chair Segal concurring) <span class="Italic">(FCI Bastrop).</span> However, even if a change is not substantively negotiable, a change stemming from the exercise of a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, is subject to "impact and implementation" bargaining. <span class="Italic">FCI Bastrop,</span> 55 FLRA at 852.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, the Authority has found that the right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses decisions as to the type of training to be assigned and the frequency and duration of such training. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States, Dep't of Homeland Sec., United States Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.,</span> 61 FLRA 113 (2005). Thus, contrary to the Judge, we find that the reduction in the number of remedial training hours resulted from the exercise of management's right to assign work. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent was obligated to engage in impact and implementation bargaining only. <span class="Italic">See FCI Bastrop,</span> 55 FLRA at 852. However, as the Respondent was required, but failed, to provide the Charging Party with notice and an opportunity to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change, we conclude that the Judge did not err in finding that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B. A <span class="Italic">Status Quo Ante</span> remedy is appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency has failed to bargain over the impact and implementation of a management decision, the Authority evaluates the appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy using the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution,</span> 8 FLRA 604 (1982) <span class="Italic">(FCI). See United States Army Corps of Eng'rs, Memphis Dist., Memphis, Tenn.,</span> 53 FLRA 79, 84 n.4 (1997). The <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors are: (1) whether and when notice was given to the union by the agency concerning the change; (2) whether and when the union requested bargaining; (3) the willfulness of the agency's conduct in failing to discharge its bargaining obligation; (4) the nature and extent of the adverse impact on unit employees; and (5) whether and to what degree a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt or impact the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See United States INS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 69, 70 n.3 (1999) (Member Wasserman dissenting as to another matter). The appropriateness of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy must be determined on a case-by-case basis, carefully balancing the nature and circumstances of the particular violation against the degree of disruption in government operations that would be caused by such a remedy. <span class="Italic">FCI,</span> 8 FLRA at 606.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first three <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors, the Judge found, and the Respondent does not dispute, that the Respondent provided the Charging Party with notice of its decision to reduce the amount of remedial training hours, one month after the change had gone into effect. The Respondent asserts that it "attempted" to give notice to the Charging Party of changes to the firearms policy and that it participated in good faith discussions regarding such changes. However, the Respondent has not offered any evidence that the Judge erred in finding that it provided the Charging Party with notice of its decision only after the decision had become effective. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Prescott, Ariz.,</span> 46 FLRA 471, 476-77 (1992) <span class="Italic">(VAMC Prescott)</span> (<span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy appropriate when agency failed to give union notice prior to the change). Therefore, these <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factors support a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fourth factor, as discussed above, the court determined in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council,</span> 446 F.3d at 166-67, that a reduction in the number of remedial training hours from eighty to eight had more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on working conditions, which resulted in an adverse impact on unit employees. <span class="Italic">See also Soc. Sec. Admin., Gilroy Branch Office, Gilroy, Cal.,</span> 53 FLRA 1358, 1370 (1998) (judge's finding that change in appointment schedule had more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect supported <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy); <span class="Italic">VAMC Prescott,</span> 46 FLRA at 476-77 (change in work schedules that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> supported <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy). Accordingly, the fourth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor supports a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the fifth factor, it is well established that the Authority requires a respondent's argument regarding this factor to be "based on record evidence." <span class="Italic">Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv., Waco Distrib. Ctr., Waco, Tex.,</span> 53 FLRA 749, 763 (1997). The Respondent argues that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy would disrupt the efficiency of its operations because a requirement to provide eighty hours of remedial training would force the Respondent to "expend excessive and potentially unnecessary hours to train an employee." However, the Respondent has offered no evidence to support this argument. Accordingly, the fifth <span class="Italic">FCI</span> factor supports finding that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Def. Commissary Agency, Peterson Air Force Base, Colo. Springs, Colo.,</span> 61 FLRA 688, 695 (2006); <span class="Italic">VAMC Prescott,</span> 46 FLRA at 476-77.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in the rate of reimbursement of travel expenses exceeded the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> threshold, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey and AFGE Local 723</span>, 68 FLRA 734, 740 (2015):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency next argues that it did not commit a ULP because the proposals related to per diem reimbursements are nonnegotiable.&#x2003;Although the Agency acknowledges Authority case law holding that an agency must complete impact-and-implementation bargaining before changing conditions of employment, it claims that because the Union never submitted proposals addressing the impact and implementation of the reduced M&#x0026;IE rates, "it can be inferred that any procedural issues were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and, thus, there was no obligation to bargain." This statement reflects a misunderstanding of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine. In determining whether a change is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the Authority looks at the effects of the change as a whole, rather than analyzing the effects of the negotiable aspects of the change.[86] Further, the Authority has found changes to be greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> where the change affected employees financially.[87]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[86]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 528, 530 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 66 FLRA 247, 253 (2011)) ("[A]n agency is required to bargain over the impact and implementation of changes that have greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effects on conditions of employment.")</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[87]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of VA, Med. Ctr., Leavenworth, Kan</span>., 60 FLRA 315, 318 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Leavenworth</span>) (Member Armendariz dissenting in part)) (affecting award pools); <span class="Italic">Leavenworth</span>, 60 FLRA at 318 (overtime opportunities).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Agency's claim that per diem reimbursements are nonnegotiable does not provide a defense to its failure to bargain prior to reducing the M&#x0026;IE rates. Moreover, as discussed below, its assertion that its reduction in M&#x0026;IE rates was nonnegotiable is incorrect.</p>
