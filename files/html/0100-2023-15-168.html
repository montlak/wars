<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-167"><span class="space">b.</span> Charge Based on Agency Regulation or Standard of Conduct Not Tied to Title VII</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency must meet Title VII's standards when it explicitly charges an appellant with violating this statute, but not when the agency's action rests on its own policy or rule. <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HILLEN_PHILLIP_G_DC075285103241_OPINION_AND_ORDER_218101.pdf">35 MSPR 453</a>, 462 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 42 MSPR 644, 648-49 (1989) (verbal abuse and an incident of physical contact undermined a supervisor's relationships with female subordinates and harmed the agency's confidence in his supervisory abilities); <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 85, 89 &#x0026; n.3 (1988) ("[B]ecause the agency relied upon its own policy to support its action and not upon Title VII, it was unnecessary for the administrative judge to analyze the appellant's misconduct under the more stringent Title VII standards."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 62 MSPR 71, 75 (1994) ("[W]hen an agency specifically cites and relies upon its own regulation prohibiting discrimination, it need not meet the Title VII standards for establishing discrimination."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Alberto v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 50, 63 &#x00B6; 14 (2004) (proposal and decision notices did not refer to the agency's sexual harassment policy or to Title VII; the deciding official's "deposition testimony that he believed the appellant's charged misconduct violated the agency's sexual harassment policy, which testimony was taken approximately 7 months after he effected the appellant's removal, does not alter in any way the charge against the appellant set forth in the agency's proposal notice"). <span class="Italic">Tyler</span> determined, 38 MSPR at 90:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency was not required to postpone taking action against the appellant until discriminatory conditions for which it could be held liable resulted....&#8197;The agency was entitled to punish the appellant's misconduct <span class="Italic">before</span> it created a hostile workplace environment, and to discipline the appellant for misconduct which, if left unpunished, was likely to have an adverse effect on the agency's functioning....&#8197;A finding of "sexual harassment" in this case, therefore, does not require a determination that the appellant's conduct was "sufficiently severe or pervasive" under Title VII standards, or that the agency could be held liable under Title VII....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vaughan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 411, 416 (1989), sustained a suspension for one instance of sexually offensive horseplay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an agency takes action against an employee under its own regulations or under 29 CFR 1604.11 can affect the nature of the agency's burden of proving the offense charged. If an agency bases its charge of sexual harassment on agency regulations, it is not bound by the same requirements of proof as an action brought under Title VII....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency's regulation defines sexual harassment as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...deliberate or repeated offensive comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in a work or work-related environment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More directly, under <span class="Italic">Nikovitz v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 509, 512 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since we have interpreted the agency's Charge No. 1 to allege that the appellant engaged in misconduct by violating the agency's policy on sexual harassment, and not by violating Title VII, the agency need only have established that the misconduct occurred, that the disciplinary action based on the misconduct would promote the efficiency of the service, and that the penalty imposed based on the sustained conduct was reasonable....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gregory v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 607, 616-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25, 29-30, 2010 MSPB 175 (2010), summarized the distinction between a Title VII violation and something else:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an agency charges an employee with violating its hostile work environment sexual harassment policy but not with violating Title VII, and the agency policy defines sexual harassment without explicit reference to Federal law and without tracking Title VII, thus setting forth a lower threshold for proving sexual harassment, the agency is required to prove only that the appellant's conduct violated the agency's policy. <span class="Italic">Viens v. Department of the Interior</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 6 (2002).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency's sexual harassment policies in this appeal did not explicitly reference Title VII, the issue in this case is whether the agency policies sufficiently track the language of Title VII regulations and guidance as to make it appropriate to require the agency to prove sexual harassment under the Title VII standard. Title VII is violated when the workplace is permeated with unwelcome discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson</span>, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, as the administrative judge found, the agency could simply have charged the appellant with inappropriate conduct if it did not want to meet the Title VII standard; it was not required to cite an agency policy <span id="Page_2663"></span>to support such a charge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hatch v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 260, 266 (1989) (stating that not all misconduct for which disciplinary action may be taken is specifically prohibited by statute or regulation). Part of the problem appears to have been that the agency chose to cite policies but lacked a clear understanding of which policies it was charging the appellant with violating. In that regard, the agency apparently argued at hearing that the "Department of the Army policy" referred to in its charges was not simply a general reference to the two more specifically identified October 5, 2006 policies, but a reference to a June 8, 2007 Commander's Policy Memorandum #3, Command Policy, Prevention of Sexual Harassment and a July 31, 2008 Army Policy on Harassment, which it attempted to introduce. The appellant objected, and the administrative judge sustained the objection. We agree with the administrative judge that the agency's vague reference to "Department of the Army policy" in the charges, when it specified the 2006 policies by title and date, did not place the appellant on notice that it was charging him with violating additional agency policies, and, thus, that Raso should not have found that the appellant violated the 2008 policy. In general, we also note that Raso's testimony revealed that he had no clear understanding of the sexual harassment standard he applied in sustaining the adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given its own inability to clarify the policies and standards underlying the charges, the agency has not explained why the administrative judge should have applied principles of statutory construction in an attempt to harmonize its policies. The agency further has not explained why the administrative judge should have attempted to interpret them in such a way as to apply to separate and distinct situations. Because the language in the agency's sexual harassment policies closely tracks the language in Title VII, the administrative judge correctly applied the Title VII sexual harassment standard to both charges. <span class="Italic">Viens</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Osman v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-0752-15-0030-I-2 (NP 8/11/2016), also considered if an agency's harassment policy requires proof of a Title VII hostile environment offense when the charge is unbecoming conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency charges an employee with violating its hostile work environment sexual harassment policy but not with violating Title VII, and the agency policy defines sexual harassment without explicit reference to Federal law and without tracking Title VII, the agency is required to prove only that the appellant's conduct violated the agency's policy. <span class="Italic">Viens v. Department of the Interior</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). When, however, an agency charges an employee with violating its sexual harassment policy and that policy explicitly references the Title VII standard, including creating a hostile work environment, the Title VII standard must be applied, and the agency is required to prove that the appellant's conduct violated Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, when an agency charges an employee with violating its hostile work environment sexual harassment policy and that policy tracks the language of Title VII's regulations, even though the policy does not explicitly reference them, the proper standard for judging the alleged misconduct is that of Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that Title VII standards do not apply because neither the proposal notice nor the cited agency policy refers explicitly to Title VII. However, while the policy memorandum does not refer to Title VII by name, it pertains to "Unlawful Harassment," and contains a statement that "[u]nlawful harassment (including sexual harassment) violates Federal law." The reference to Title VII is implicit but unmistakable. We therefore find that, to prove its charge, the agency must establish that the appellant created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. While the agency could have charged the appellant with inappropriate behavior without reference to the policy memorandum in question, the Board is required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency, and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the evidence, the agency clearly met its burden of proving that the appellant created a hostile work environment in violation of Title VII. In proposing the appellant's removal, the agency described numerous obscene and humiliating remarks and gestures, some racially charged, that the appellant directed toward M.K. on a daily basis over a period of several months. The proposal notice further related that M.K. felt "creeped out" and "disgusted" by the appellant's comments, that he told the appellant to stop making such comments, that he tried to keep his distance from the appellant, that he requested that the appellant be moved to another shop, and that he believed the appellant created a hostile work environment. The administrative judge credited the agency's version of events over the appellant's, based in part on his observations of witness demeanor, and the appellant has not identified sufficiently sound reasons to overturn his credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge then addressed the issue of whether the contact was sexual in nature, as required by the agency policy. In three instances, the administrative judge determined that the physical contact was not sexual in nature, especially as these witnesses testified to that effect. Of the remaining four witnesses, the administrative judge found that the physical contact involving three of them was inherently sexual in nature, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the appellant resting his hand on an employee's thigh, sandwiching an employee between himself and the copy machine, and rubbing an employee's leg. Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant's repeated sexually inviting comments to the final witness constituted deliberate and repeated offensive comments in violation of the agency's policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the actions themselves on petition for review. The appellant does claim that no sexual intent was present, the victims were not injured, and the harassment was not pervasive. Since we find that the agency did not charge the appellant with the creation of a Title VII type of hostile environment, these objections have no merit.[2] The administrative judge correctly determined that the actions noted above are inherently sexual in nature. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vaughan</span>, 40 MSPR at 417. As required under the agency's policy, the appellant's conduct constituted offensive comments and physical contact of a sexual nature within the workplace, and we therefore affirm the administrative judge's decision sustaining the charge of sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;It should be noted, however, that, even under a Title VII hostile environment standard of proof, an agency is not required to prove sexual "intent" or specific "injury" to the victims.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard of proof required of an agency when charging an employee with sexual harassment varies depending on the basis of the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carosella v.

As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229 (1993), if the agency brings a charge of sexual harassment under Title VII and its implementing regulations or under agency policy essentially identical to the Title VII regulations, then the agency is required to prove not only that the unwelcome sexual conduct occurred, but also that the conduct involved <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment or created a hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 233-34. In contrast, if an agency takes an adverse action based on a charge of violating the agency's policy against sexual harassment, then the agency need only address that policy and follow the appropriate procedures for taking an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 234. Upon review, we find that the administrative judge applied an erroneous standard in his analysis of the charge of sexual harassment, specifically in requiring the agency to prove a hostile work environment or unreasonable interference with Ms. Howie's work performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The November 30, 1992, proposal notice charges the appellant with sexual harassment, not with the creation of a hostile work environment, and it says nothing about the incident's effect, if any, on Ms. Howie's work performance. The proposal notice references "NAC INST 12750.4H," which is a document setting forth the agency's, not EEOC'S, guidelines pertaining to disciplinary and adverse actions. The specification supporting the charge of sexual harassment in the proposal notice reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On 4 November 1992, you harassed a female employee by making comments about her attire, putting your arm around her and telling her you were "in love with her," and stating you wanted her to come to your hotel room and "mess around."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in this specification or in the more detailed account of the incident given in the proposal notice indicates that the agency charged the appellant with creating a hostile work environment or affecting Howie's job performance. Moreover, neither the proposal notice nor the removal letter mention Title VII or hostile work environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency policy statement on sexual harassment issued by Captain R.J. Henry defines sexual harassment, in relevant part, as "deliberate or repeated offensive comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in a work environment." Contrary to the administrative judge, we find that the reference to "work environment" in the agency's policy statement relates not to Title VII, but to the general disruption to the efficient functioning of the agency caused by the type of conduct with which the agency charged the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alsedek</span>, at 235-36. Interpreting agency policies similar to this one, the Board has sustained agency actions upon finding that the conduct took place at work or in a work-related setting, but without requiring a finding that the conduct created a hostile work environment for the victims. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Vaughan</span>, 40 MSPR at 416.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In part, the administrative judge found that Title VII standards apply based on language in a January 6, 1992, memorandum from Commander W.C. Bowes of the Naval Air Systems Command to the effect that sexual harassment occurs when, among other circumstances not pertinent here, "such conduct interferes with an individual's performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment." The administrative judge also relied on a brochure entitled "Prevention of Sexual Harassment." The brochure, which was prepared by the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC), cites to EEOC Guidelines providing that sexually harassing behavior is unlawful when the "conduct unreasonably interferes with the employee's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment." The brochure mentions that sexual harassment was made illegal with the passage of Title VII and that disciplinary action may be taken against harassers. The purpose of the brochure, in our opinion, is to emphasize that sexual harassment is unlawful under Title VII and that persons found liable for sexual harassment under Title VII may be disciplined. However, it does not state that all misconduct will be charged under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The policy statement issued by Captain Henry, the memorandum from Commander Bowes, the NAWC brochure, and the format of the August 1992 stand-down training show merely that the agency could have charged the appellant with sexual harassment under Title VII and its implementing regulations, under agency policy essentially identical to the Title VII regulations, or under agency policy against sexual harassment defined as "deliberate or repeated offensive comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in a work environment." The proposal notice charged the appellant with offensive comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature while at a workshop in New Orleans. In light of the absence of any reference in the proposal notice to Title VII, EEOC regulations or guidelines, hostile work environment, or the work performance of the harassed coworker, we find that the agency was not required to establish hostile work environment or unreasonable interference with Howie's work performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 85, 89-90 (1988) (when an agency does not cite either its own regulations or EEOC's regulations but relies solely on its own policy in taking an action, its action is governed by agency, rather than EEOC, standards).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The long and short of all this appears to be that an agency need not meet Title VII standards when its actions rest on its own valid policy or rule, but the statutory standards must be met if the employer's rule restates EEOC regulations defining sexual harassment. <span class="Italic">Hatch v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 260, 266 (1989) (conduct and comments could be evaluated on the basis of whether they constituted sexual harassment under Title VII or whether they violated generally accepted rules of conduct expected of a supervisor); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 225, 228 (1990) ("Since the agency charged the appellant with a violation of its policy and regulation concerning sexual harassment, the agency need only have established that the misconduct occurred as charged, that the disciplinary action based on the misconduct would promote the efficiency of the service, and that the penalty imposed based on the sustained misconduct was reasonable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may charge both violations of EEOC regulations defining sexual harassment and violations of agency policies prohibiting improper conduct of a sexual nature. The Board considered a dual charge in <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 480, 483-85 (1996), and remanded the appeal to the AJ for consideration under both components of the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency suspended the appellant for 60 days based on a charge of sexual harassment of a female co-worker. Specifically, the agency alleged that he sexually harassed Judy Worsham, one of his female co-workers, continuously from July 1993 through July 1994 by making repeated unwelcome and unwanted comments, gestures, and innuendoes of a sexual nature. The agency alleged that, by his conduct, the appellant created a hostile and intimidating working situation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge reversed the agency's suspension action, finding that it failed to prove its charge by preponderant evidence because there was no evidence that the appellant made gestures of a sexual nature, and because his remarks did not rise to the level of sexual harassment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard of proof required of an agency when charging an employee with sexual harassment will vary depending upon the basis of the charge. <span class="Italic">See Carosella v. US Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 641-42 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 233 (1993). Where an agency charges an appellant under Title VII and 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11(a), it must prove both that the unwelcome conduct occurred, and that the conduct involved <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> harassment or created a hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">See Alsedek</span>, 58 MSPR at 233. In contrast, an agency taking an adverse action against an employee based on a charge of violating the agency's policy against sexual harassment need only address that policy and follow the appropriate procedures for taking an adverse action, not Title VII regulations and procedures. <span class="Italic">Id.; Alexander v. US Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 183, 186 n.1 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency adopted the definition of sexual harassment set forth at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604.11. Its policy statement on sexual harassment, however, broadened that definition, stating that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any person in a supervisory or command position who uses or condones implicitly or explicitly sexual behavior to control, influence, or affect the career, pay or job of a military member or civilian employee is engaging in sexual harassment. Similarly, any military member or civilian employee who makes deliberate or repeated unwelcome verbal comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature is also engaging in sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Notice of Proposed Suspension stated, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">This proposed action is being taken in accordance with</span> the general character and intent of Cause of Action 29b [of the agency's Table of Penalties]...and <span class="Italic">29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604</span>.... You created a hostile and intimidating working situation for [Worsham] by your actions.... I find no excuse for any employee, yourself included, not knowing and abiding by <span class="Italic">[the agency's]</span> <span class="Italic"> policy concerning sexual harassment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining how charges are to be construed, the Board will examine the structure and language of the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schifano v. Veterans Administration</span>, 70 MSPR 275, 278 (1996). Here, because charges brought under Title VII and under the agency's policy are separate and distinct, requiring different elements of proof, <span class="Italic">see Alsedek</span>, 58 MSPR at 233, and because the agency's notice cited to both 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1604 and its own policy statement concerning sexual harassment, we conclude that the most reasonable reading of the notice is that the agency intended to charge the appellant separately under both Title VII and its policy statement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Brim v. US Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 494, 497 (1991) (agency charged the appellant with sexual harassment and conduct unbecoming a Postal Service employee). We therefore find that the administrative judge erred in failing to determine whether the appellant's conduct violated the agency's policy. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hatch v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 40 MSPR 260, 266 (1989) (where the agency charged the appellant with making offensive comments of a sexual nature, but neither the agency's proposal notice nor its decision letter specified whether it was relying <span id="Page_2665"></span>on Title VII, its own regulations prohibiting sexual harassment, or general principles of misconduct, the administrative judge correctly found that the charges should be evaluated on the basis of whether it proved sexual harassment under Title VII and if not, whether it established that the appellant violated generally accepted rules of conduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the agency's charge be sexual harassment in violation of agency policy, a hostile environment need not be proved if the only reference to hostile environment is in the narrative explaining the basis for the less expansive charge, <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 235 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy prohibited, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "deliberate or repeated offensive comments, gestures, or physical contact of a sexual nature in a work or work-related environment." Although the administrative judge recognized this, she found that the agency had charged the appellant specifically with the creation of a hostile working environment. Upon review, we find that the administrative judge applied an erroneous standard in her analysis of the charge of sexual harassment, specifically in requiring a finding of a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Initially, we note that specification (b) of the agency's charge of sexual harassment does not charge the appellant with the creation of a hostile environment. In addition, the discussion of a "hostile environment" within the proposal notice does not constitute part of the charge or the specification. It serves only to emphasize the disruptive nature of the appellant's conduct on the workplace in the context of nexus and penalty, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the effect of his misconduct on the efficient functioning of the agency. The proposal letter does not mention Title VII and repeatedly refers to the agency's policy, which defines sexual harassment without including hostile environment in its meaning. Consequently, the parties' stipulation as to the content of that policy does not incorporate the creation of a hostile environment into the charge against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the agency charges the employee with "unprofessional conduct" arising out of sexually-oriented offensive conduct, the appellant is not prejudiced if the appeal is adjudicated by the AJ under a stricter standard of proof defining sexual harassment. In <span class="Italic">Friese v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 210, 216 (1990), "unprofessional conduct" was found, and demotion and reassignment were sustained, when the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...may have discontinued his physical advances when the subordinate female officers rejected them.... [H]is physical advances, toward young, inexperienced female subordinate employees who had recently been divorced were planned, repeated, continued over a period of several years, and created an offensive work environment...even though some of the conduct took place away from the agency's premises, the three complaining witnesses did not file EEO complaints concerning his conduct, and the judge found that the appellant's conduct was not egregious....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A charge of "conduct unbecoming a supervisor" was sustained, although the penalty was mitigated from demotion to suspension, for sexual joking with a subordinate, <span class="Italic">McManus v. DOJ</span>, 66 MSPR 564, 566, 568-69 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency asserted that the appellant had admitted during an interview "to making various sexual innuendoes to a female subordinate." The record of that interview shows that he admitted having engaged in a conversation with the subordinate (Officer White) in which he referred to "a bra size"; asked her about her preferred sexual positions; told her he had a "bulge" in his pants thinking about the subject; and "made a reference to the effect of 'Can you see how much you excite me?'" when talking to Officer White....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record contains a statement by the appellant that sexual joking and innuendo were common in the workplace and that Officer White had a practice of engaging in sexually explicit conversations; he also maintained that her complaint about his comments to her had been motivated by her unhappiness about his criticism of her work performance. Nothing in the record specifically contradicts the remarks about the office environment and Officer White's alleged practice. A statement by another employee asserted that Officer White had been a willing participant in sexually explicit conversations and had engaged in sexually provocative behavior. Moreover, Officer White admitted that she had initially participated in sex-related joking with the appellant, although she also alleged that she had later become uncomfortable with the joking and had told him that he could get in trouble for making such comments; she contended that she had then told him (apparently after the comments at issue had been made) that he should leave her alone. The appellant, however, has consistently denied that Officer White ever specifically discouraged his remarks. The record also does not contain any first-hand accounts by other individuals confirming Officer White's account of this matter. In addition, another statement in the record by Officer White provides some support for the appellant's assertion that she was angry about his criticism of her work performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, then, it appears undisputed that sexual joking and innuendo did occur in the workplace and that Officer White willingly participated in at least some of that activity. The agency nonetheless argues that the appellant's misconduct was highly serious, especially for a supervisory employee in a correctional facility, and that the existence of an atmosphere in which Officer White and others made sex-related jokes and comments is therefore irrelevant to the penalty issue. As an initial matter, we certainly agree that the appellant's comments were improper. Supervisors are held to a higher standard of conduct than other employees, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the work environment is free of offensive comments of a sexual nature<span class="Italic">. See Kirk v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 663, 671-72 (1993); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. US Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 472, 476 (1991). Moreover, correctional officers must conform to a higher standard of conduct than non-law enforcement employees, and the Department of Justice is permitted wide discretion in controlling the work-related conduct of those employees charged with maintaining the integrity of our prison system. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 234, 237 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's argument, however, we have not held that the office environment is irrelevant to the penalty issue in cases like this one. The holding cited by the agency states that an office atmosphere of sexual joking and innuendo would not be considered on the issue of whether the charge of conduct unbecoming a supervisor/sexual harassment could be sustained; that holding did not address the issue of whether the penalty imposed was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Lowe v. Department of Justice</span>, 63 MSPR 73, 76-77 (1994). Moreover, in analyzing whether mitigation was warranted in cases involving sexual misconduct, the Board has explicitly considered whether an office atmosphere of sexual joking existed and whether the misconduct at issue fell within the bounds of such an atmosphere or surpassed it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. US Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 225, 232-33 (1990), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 49 MSPR 544 (1991); <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 411, 417-18 (1989). We therefore reject the agency's argument that this issue may not be considered in reviewing the penalty issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge noted, the appellant had 11 years of service with the agency and does not appear to have been disciplined during that period. Moreover, the sexual misconduct discussed above did not involve any physical contact with Officer White. <span class="Italic">See Alsedek v. Department of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 241 (1993) (physical contact in sexual misconduct cases is an aggravating factor which may warrant a more severe penalty than might otherwise be imposed). Finally, it appears that the appellant's sexual comments to Officer White were made in an environment in which such remarks were common and in which Officer White also participated. <span class="Italic">See Jordan</span>, 44 MSPR at 232-33; <span class="Italic">Vaughan</span>, 40 MSPR at 417-18. Therefore, even after considering the undisputed seriousness of the appellant's misconduct, we find that the administrative judge did not err in mitigating his demotion to a 14-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Payne v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 419, 428 (1997) (removal for sexual harassment: an agency may hold supervisors to a higher standard of conduct because they are responsible for maintaining a working environment free of sexual harassment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A charge similar to that presented in <span class="Italic">McManus, supra,</span> supported demotion in <span class="Italic">Boyer v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3032), although the use of an "inappropriate conduct" charge was the cause of division within the court. The majority's opinion upheld the penalty against a supervisor charged with relating or permitting sexually-oriented jokes in the office:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Boyer contends principally on appeal that the charge of "inappropriate conduct for a Federal manager and supervisor" does not exist and that the AJ impermissibly substituted a different charge in affirming the agency's decision. Citing <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1988), Boyer argues the agency's general charge "covers everything and touches nothing." Although we agree Boyer's argument has some merit, we are unpersuaded in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is uncontested that "inappropriate conduct for a Federal manager and supervisor" is not identified anywhere in the agency's guidelines as a basis for disciplinary action nor are the specific instances of misconduct alleged by the agency enumerated anywhere in the agency's employee literature as improper. We agree with the agency, however, that federal employees, and in particular those in a supervisory capacity, are expected to exercise good judgment, notwithstanding the lack of literal guidance from any agency rule, regulation, or other statement of agency policy. Under our precedents an agency is not required to specifically prohibit every type of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brousseau v. United States</span>, 226 Ct. Cl. 199, 219, 640 F.2d 1235, 1247 (1981) (no written rule against organizing opposition to the policies of his superiors; supervisor's "common sense" should have forewarned him that his actions could lead to his demotion); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Mings v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 389-390 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (no written rule against writing derogatory letters about religious and ethnic groups); <span class="Italic">Brennan v. DHHS</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (no written rule required the use of standardized office worksheets). The instances of misconduct alleged by the agency and sustained by the board in this case were of such a nature that they reflect unusually poor judgment <span id="Page_2666"></span>for a supervisor. That they are not listed as a basis for disciplinary action cannot be construed as tacit agency approval for the conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable from our decision in <span class="Italic">Grubka</span> where Grubka was demoted for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, failing to satisfactorily carry out certain broadly stated agency policies, such as "failure to foster a positive EEO climate." 858 F.2d at 1576. The court rejected the agency's position, noting that the agency failed to establish any regulation had been violated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, the court refused to sustain the agency because it was not clear what would constitute a failure to satisfy the broadly stated policy. By contrast, any person in a supervisory or managerial position in an agency would understand that the cited instances of sexual "joking" are inappropriate conduct for a supervisor and would warrant disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Boyer misconstrues the board's decision when he argues that the AJ substituted a different charge for the one actually charged by the agency. In the AJ's discussion of the appropriate penalty and its relationship to the efficiency of the service, the AJ referred to an agency regulation setting forth examples of the acceptable range of penalties for a comparable charge. The reference to a comparable charge for purposes of evaluating the agency's penalty was not a substitution of charges as Boyer contends.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Plager's dissent was compelling, if not controlling, in <span class="Italic">Boyer</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Though I share my colleagues distaste for inappropriate conduct in the workplace, particularly by supervisory personnel, it is one thing to teach, in light of current standards, old dogs new tricks, it is another to punish without an articulated standard against which to measure the offending conduct. This is not a case of perceived inadequate performance by a supervisor, leading to corrective action and, if continued and found uncorrectable, perhaps even to removal. Rather, this is a case of disciplinary action against an individual, taken for violation of rules pursuant to the statutory process for adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But there is no warrant in law for the action taken here, since by the Navy's own admission Boyer's verbal joking around falls short of sexual harassment, and there is no other pre-existing rule or standard alleged to be violated. The Government cannot make otherwise lawful, even though perhaps tasteless, conduct punishable after the fact. I must therefore respectfully dissent from an affirmance of the agency's action in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have held that agency charges must be made with a reasonable degree of specificity. <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1988) The majority's attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">Grubka</span> fails. In <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, this court held that the agency's charges of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "failure to foster a positive EEO climate" violated no established standard and could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1576. As the court there observed regarding the generality of the allegation, "[t]his is a very general charge that as the old saying goes, 'it covers everything and touches nothing.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency has cited no policy against telling jokes, even jokes in bad taste. The Navy has been known for ribald humor and language, as any veteran will attest. By today's standards such behavior may be considered tasteless, and offensive to some. The Navy is free to instruct its employees about what is now considered proper decorum in the workplace, and to provide guidance to them. It is not free to punish employees for conduct that has not been made punishable. In this case, as in <span class="Italic">Grubka</span>, the agency has failed to show that it ever established the rules of behavior which it claims the employee violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Boyer is a civilian employee of the Navy, agency rather than military law applies to this case. Nonetheless, military law is instructive on the issue here. Members of the military may be held to what on its face is a rather vague standard of conduct. Article 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) provides: "Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct." 10 USC &#x00A7; 933 (1988). That superficially vague standard, however, is given substance and detail by the military community's long years of tradition, so that specific acts "'which have been recognized to be crimes and offenses by the usages in the navy of all nations...[shall be] punished according to the laws and customs of the sea.'" <span class="Italic">Parker v. Levy</span>, 417 U.S. 733, 747 (1974), quoting <span class="Italic">Dynes v. Hoover</span>, 61 U.S. (20 How.) 65, 82 (1857). In light of that tradition, Article 133 is not void for vagueness under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Levy</span>, 417 U.S. at 757.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy's current efforts to be more sensitive to its diverse workforce may be commendable. But the Navy cannot claim long years of tradition in explication of "inappropriate conduct" as it applies to its civilian workforce, and besides military life and military law are different from civilian life and civilian law. "In civilian life there is no legal sanction--civil or criminal--for failure to behave as an officer and a gentleman; in the military world, Art. 133 imposes such a sanction on a commissioned officer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 749. The military, "a specialized society separate from civilian society," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 743, may require its members to behave according not only to military law, but to the commands of superiors, and, as in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, to rules nowhere explicitly articulated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the obedience that characterizes military life, we understand members of civil society to be at liberty. The bounds of that liberty are set forth by the law. Although there are non-legal bounds on a civilian's behavior, etiquette being one germane to this case, trespass of those bounds does not give rise to legal action. If the law is silent, we assume that the civilian's liberty is not yet at its end.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Boyer was not removed because of his poor performance. In fact, both the deciding official and the administrative judge noted Boyer's fine performance as a factor mitigating the severity of the action taken by the agency. Because the agency could not show that Boyer violated one of its established rules for which discipline may be imposed under the law, the agency's decision to demote Boyer is without warrant in law and should be reversed. I respectfully dissent from the judgment of the court holding otherwise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A variant of the "unprofessional conduct" theme is a charge of "notorious" or "disgraceful" conduct. Although the charged actions may be sexual and may lead to a variety of charges, including sexual harassment, if the misconduct supports an independent charge of notorious or disgraceful conduct, it serves as a basis for discipline whether or not it also constitutes sexual harassment, <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 318-19 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because sexual harassment is defined under the agency's policy statement as "unwelcomed sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct," the administrative judge correctly concluded that consensual sexual behavior is inconsistent with a charge of sexual harassment. We know of no reason, however, why consensual sexual conduct in the work place could not be disgraceful conduct. According to the undisputed evidence, the appellant exposed his penis to Bryan while on duty on at least two occasions. If such behavior does not constitute disgraceful conduct, we are at a loss to imagine what would. Accordingly, the administrative judge erred in not sustaining the charge of disgraceful conduct regarding the appellant's behavior toward Bryan, regardless of whether she consented to it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alexander v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 183, 186-87, 190-92 (1995), sustained removal of an EAS-18 Manager, Maintenance Operations Support, for conduct unbecoming a Postal Service employee: numerous specifications of harassment of a verbal and physical nature of a female subordinate in violation of the agency's policies prohibiting sexual harassment. The factual basis for the removal in <span class="Italic">Alexander</span> (also discussed under "<a href="0100-2023-14-067.html#sec7-66">Denial of Misconduct; Vigorous Defense,"</a> in Chapter 7 of the <span class="Italic">Guide</span>) was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[F]rom February 1989 through September 1992, the appellant subjected subordinate employee, Edna Lewis, a level 3 Labor Custodian, and sometimes acting custodial supervisor, to sexual harassment, which included pervasive sexual conduct of a verbal and physical nature, including sexually explicit remarks concerning his own prowess and Ms. Lewis' relationship with her husband. Specifically, on May 9, 1989, the appellant indicated to Ms. Lewis that he had power over her and if she was as good in bed as she was as a supervisor, she could move up with him. In August 1989, Ms. Lewis requested to be detailed to a position at the Civic Center Post Office. The appellant contacted her at home and advised that if she would sleep with him, she would be detailed and, if not, someone else would be detailed; someone else was eventually detailed. On two occasions the appellant showed his erect penis to Ms. Lewis. On a Saturday in February, 1990, the appellant told Ms. Lewis "to look what you do to me," or words to that effect, and indicated his erect penis, clearly visible in his pants; further he told Ms. Lewis that he could not work in the same office without sleeping with her. On Saturday, April 12, 1991, the appellant remarked to Ms. Lewis that the Building Services Supervisor position would soon be posted for bid and there was one thing she had not yet done to warrant being considered for the position. He continued to discuss Ms. Lewis' sleeping with him while removing his penis from his pants and holding it in his hands. Ms. Lewis was not selected for that position because of a negative remark in her evaluation made by the appellant. In October 1991, Ms. Lewis would have been detailed to a job at the Airmail Facility but was not detailed because the appellant, who continued to solicit sexual favors from her, changed his mind about the number of jobs needed at such facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, what emerges from a review of the deciding official's and the administrative judge's consideration of the penalty is that they carefully weighed many factors and found that the seriousness and intentional nature of the offenses, and the appellant's supervisory position, outweighed any factor in favor of mitigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the mitigating factors already mentioned, the appellant suggests in his petition for review, that numerous other mitigating factors exist. These include that some of the remarks were joking, the misconduct did not involve physical force or touching, there was no misconduct towards anyone but Ms. Lewis, there was only one brief incident of self-exposure, and he continued to supervise the affected employee until her early retirement in September 1992. Moreover, the agency did not remove him until June 1994. Upon consideration of these bases, we still do not find mitigation warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2667"></span>As Diane Regan testified at the hearing, the agency did not act upon the matter until after the EEO hearing and decision by Michael Baldonado because no one was aware that such egregious conduct had occurred until explicitly established in Judge Baldonado's opinion. Further, none of the remarks have been shown to be "joking," as the appellant contends. Additionally, even though the misconduct at issue here did not involve touching, it, nonetheless, remains serious in nature. We have found only one case involving sexual harassment where an employee has been charged with exposing his penis to a female subordinate. There the Board found that the removal penalty was appropriate, despite evidence that the appellant's medical and psychological condition may have contributed to his behavior. The Board so found because it considered the misconduct so "extremely serious." <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 309, 325 (1993).[3] We note that the misconduct in <span class="Italic">Walker</span> involved two women and also involved touching, and thus that <span class="Italic">Walker</span> is not on all fours with the instant case, which arguably involves less serious misconduct. Nonetheless, the incident of self-exposure and other misconduct here are, in our judgment, sufficiently serious also to warrant removal, especially in light of the absence of any claim or evidence that the appellant's behavior was due to a medical or psychological condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;It is axiomatic that each case must be judged on its specific facts. The appellant attempts to distinguish the cases relied upon by the administrative judge in finding the charged misconduct here so serious as to warrant removal as improperly relied upon because, unlike this case, they involved aggressive physical contact....&#8197;We agree that such conduct is distinguishable from that at issue here; nonetheless, the fact that physical contact is serious and may also warrant removal does not mean that other misconduct may not be so serious as to warrant removal as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also regarding mitigation, the appellant claims that the facts here are virtually indistinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Hooks</span> and thus warrant mitigation to a demotion to a nonsupervisory position as in <span class="Italic">Hooks</span>. <span class="Italic">Hooks</span>, however, would not warrant a different result in the instant case, even if it were a precedential decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in <span class="Italic">Hooks</span> are distinguishable because they do not involve the type of misconduct at issue in this case. There, the appellant was charged with grabbing a female employee and saying he wanted "to get familiar" with her, and with making advances toward, and physical contact, of an unspecified nature, with another female employee. Under the circumstances of the case, the Board found demotion from a supervisory position to be the maximum reasonable penalty. As detailed above, the charges in this case clearly differ. Also, in <span class="Italic">Hooks</span>, the Board noted that the agency had failed to consider all of the relevant mitigating factors and thus had abused its discretion in removing the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Hooks</span>, 41 MSPR at 439. Here, as detailed above, the agency considered an extensive range of factors. Thus, there was no abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant alleges that the inflammatory nature of the events at issue in this appeal prevented a reasoned approach to the penalty on the part of both the agency and the administrative judge, the evidence shows that each considered all of the relevant factors and arrived at a reasoned decision. The fact that conduct may be so serious as to outweigh other factors that could bear on mitigation does not prevent an agency from imposing a penalty, nor does it prevent the Board from sustaining a penalty. All that is required is consideration of the relevant factors that have bearing upon a penalty under the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>
