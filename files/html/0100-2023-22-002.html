<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-3"><span class="space">A.</span> STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BASIS FOR FEES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Several statutes confer on the Board and reviewing courts the authority to award fees to successful appellants. These include the Reform Act, the Back Pay Act (applied by arbitrators and agencies that decide to pay fees without a directive from the Board), and the Equal Access to Justice Act (used by courts to award fees in litigation against the United States and its agencies and used by the Board to award fees in cases unsuccessfully brought by agencies against administrative law judges). Fee-shifting provisions of civil rights statutes are incorporated by reference into the Reform Act. The Whistleblower Protection Act amended the Reform Act to provide supplemental authority for fee awards in whistleblower appeals. Other statutes, VEOA and USERRA, have fee provisions. The benefit of these statutes is for appellants with counsel, that is, awards of attorney fees are for those with attorneys. Only the appellants who prevail may apply for fees; for those appellants, fee awards are usually not automatic. Decisions finding discrimination, VEOA violations, and prohibited personnel practices aside, fees are recovered by prevailing appellants in routine appeals only under the discretionary "interest of justice" standard and under a discretionary standard in USERRA cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's authority to award fees extends to the full range of appeals adjudicated. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), explained the scope of the Board's authority to award fees in a corrective action case initiated by OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Frazier, whose transfer was rescinded by the Board, challenges the Board's refusal to award him attorney's fees. The Board concluded that the authority to award fees granted by section 7701(g) of the Act does not extend to corrective action proceedings. Relying on the language, placement, and history of the section, the Board decided that its power to grant fees was limited to Chapter 77 appeal cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin by noting that monetary liability may not be imposed against a federal agency unless Congress has clearly waived sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society</span>, 421 U.S. 240, 267-68, 95 S. Ct. 1612, 1626-27, 44 L. Ed.2d 141 (1975); <span class="Italic">N.A.A.C.P. v. Civiletti</span>, 609 F.2d 514, 516 (D.C. Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Andrulis v. U.S.</span>, 447 U.S. 922, 100 S. Ct. 3012, 65 L. Ed.2d 1114 (1980). We must decide, therefore, whether such a waiver can be found in the express language of section 7701(g) or by "necessary implication from the statutory context in which (the) fee provision arises." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 516-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statutory language</span>. As relevant, section 7701(g) provides: [T]he Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney's fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee, as the case may be, determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interests of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit. The section is not expressly limited to appeals brought under Chapter 77. Indeed, it extends to "any case" and explicitly includes those, like the present one, that involve prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board nevertheless relies on the emphasized phrases to argue that "the provision's language clearly presupposes the existence of...an appeal." We find the Board's reading strained. First, the Board notes that the beginning of the section refers to the decisionmakers assigned by the Act to Chapter 77 appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> section 7701(b). Yet section 1205, on whose broad grant of procedural discretion the Board depends in another context...specifically permits the Board to delegate the hearing of "all matters within (its) jurisdiction" to the same decisionmakers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Board contends that the phrase "hear a case" limits the operation of the section to those proceedings in which the Act expressly provides for a hearing. This argument stands somewhat uncomfortably beside the Board's insistence that it had the power--perhaps even the duty--to conduct a hearing in this case. In any event, the provision is not, by its terms restricted to cases which must include a formal hearing. Rather, the language easily covers any case the Board chooses to hear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the Board suggests that an employee can only be a "prevailing party" within the language of the section when he or she appeals as of right under Chapter 77. In this very case, however, the Board permitted the deputies, through their attorneys, "fully [to] participate in this proceeding as any other party." The Board thus implicitly recognized that intervenors can have the status of parties. The rights conferred by that status may include the right to request attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States v. Board of Education of Waterbury, Connecticut</span>, 605 F.2d 573, 576 (2d Cir. 1979) (finding authority to award fees to district court intervenor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board asserts that the last clause of the fee provision "which gives examples of when an award is 'warranted in the interest of justice,' refers to specified kinds of appeal cases, as the introductory word 'including' indicates." While "including" certainly suggests an example, the phrase "any case" hardly seems restricted to appeals. The instant proceeding was manifestly a "case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency," as the Board itself determined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, we are unconvinced by the Board's effort to import unusual meaning into the words of the section. The phrases "hear a case" and "prevailing party" are not, as this case demonstrates, restricted in common usage to the type of action contemplated by Chapter 77. And the reference to "any case" involving prohibited practices plainly extends to all proceedings in which action is sought to identify and correct such practices. Read naturally, the language of the provision clearly waives sovereign immunity with respect to any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legislative intent</span>. The Board suggests that, however broad the language of section 7701(g) may be, there are independent indications that Congress intended to limit the operation of the provision to Chapter 77 appeals. Specifically, the Board points to the fact that the fees provision is part of a section entitled "Appellate procedures" which in turn appears in Chapter 77. Furthermore, the Board notes, references to fees in the legislative history occasionally speak of appeals but never mention corrective action cases. For reasons just detailed, the Board's parsing of the section fails to disclose the kinds of linguistic ambiguities that require resort to interpretive aids like placement and history. We believe, nevertheless, that the Board's contentions reflect an unduly narrow understanding of the statutory scheme. Accordingly, we will discuss them briefly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We may assume, from the section's placement and from various references in the legislative history to appeals, that Congress expected the fees provision to operate chiefly in the context of Chapter 77 actions. That fact alone, however, does not demonstrate that Congress intended to limit its waiver of immunity to such cases. At least two views of the legislative intent are plausible. Congress may, as the Board suggests, have assumed that the presence of the Special Counsel and the nature of corrective action proceedings make fee awards in such cases unnecessary or unwise. Alternatively, Congress may have allowed awards in all cases in which employees participate as parties. In that case, references in the history to appeals may simply reflect the fact that the possibility of such participation in corrective action proceedings was not immediately apparent to Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe the latter hypothesis is more consistent with the available evidence. The purpose of the fees provision was set forth in the Senate <span id="Page_4528"></span>Report at length: The Civil Service Commission currently does not have the authority to require agencies to pay the attorney fees of employees who prevail in their appeals. Employees whose agencies have taken unfounded actions against them may spend a considerable amount of money defending themselves against these actions (yet) they cannot be reimbursed for attorney fees upon prevailing in their appeals to the Commission. Instead, they must file civil actions against the Government in order to obtain a review of their requests for reimbursement. The legislation remedies this problem by authorizing the Board members and hearing officials to require payment, by agencies which are losing parties to proceedings before the Board, of attorney fees to the employees who prevailed....[66]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As expressed in this passage, the policy underlying the fees provision, while stated with reference to appeals, seems applicable to any proceeding in which an aggrieved employee seeks to vindicate rights conferred by the Act. As the Board may have recognized when it allowed the deputies to appear through their own lawyers, an employee can have a strong interest in challenging "agencies [that] have taken unfounded actions against them" even when those actions can only be remedied through a corrective action petition. Nor is that interest necessarily protected by the Special Counsel, whose efforts to assure a properly managed civil service may conflict with the goals of individual employees. Indeed, given the negotiating process that precedes the filing of a petition, the Special Counsel may commonly take a position before the Board that is somewhere between that of the employer and the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it seems doubtful that Congress concluded that separate representation, and thereby fee authority, would be unnecessary in corrective action proceedings. Instead, Congress seems to have conferred authority to award fees in all cases in which employees appear as parties and permitted the Board to decide whether such appearances and fees were appropriate in corrective action proceedings. As noted earlier...corrective action petitions, unlike appeals, did not exist prior to the enactment of the CSRA. Congress was quite familiar with the experience of the Civil Service Commission in treating appeals and, in an effort to improve that process, elaborated the procedures governing such cases in considerable detail. In contrast, the initial shaping of corrective action procedures was left to the Board; Congress authorized the proceeding in a few open-ended sentences. Those sentences gave the Board the discretion, which it exercised in this case, to employ many of the procedures associated with appeals and to conclude that the interests of the employees involved justified independent representation. We are confident that that flexibility is also broad enough to permit the Board to create a proceeding which by its nature would be within the intent of the waiver of sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we hold the Board erred in determining that it lacked authority to assess attorney's fees in favor of the successful deputy. The language of section 7701(g) of the Act plainly waives sovereign immunity in any case in which an employee or applicant for employment appears as a party. Moreover, while the placement and history of the provision indicate that Congress did not expect fees questions to arise in corrective action proceedings, the intent of section 7701(g) together with the statutory scheme clearly give the Board the flexibility to award fees in appropriate corrective action cases. By permitting the deputies to appear through their own lawyers, the Board raised the possibility that this was such a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion does not, of course, require the Board to award fees to petitioner Frazier. The Board must decide, in the first instance, whether the role employees play in the kind of proceeding it has established here implicates the policy underlying the fees provision. If so, the Board should consider whether Frazier can be called a "prevailing party" in light of his victory on the EEO wing of the case and whether "payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice." In examining the value of employee participation in corrective action proceedings, both in general and in the particular case, the Board may take into account the presence and role of the Special Counsel. We decide only that Congress has granted the Board power to award fees in all cases within its jurisdiction in which complaining employees appear as parties.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, in order to be entitled to an award of attorney fees, an appellant must show that an attorney-client relationship exists pursuant to which counsel rendered legal services on the appellant's behalf in connection with a Board proceeding, that the appellant was the prevailing party, that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice, and that the fees requested are reasonable. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v.
