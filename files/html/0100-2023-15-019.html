<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-20"><span class="space">6.</span> Evidence of Illness First Submitted to MSPB</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Just as nothing in law or regulation restricts an agency to relying on its documentary administrative record or withholds from the agency a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise rebut an appellant's evidence presented for the first time at the Board's hearing, circumstances of an AWOL appeal may justify appellant's submission of determinative medical evidence of illness for the first time at the MSPB hearing. The AWOL charge may still be sustained, despite medical evidence, if the appellant did not comply with procedures governing leave requests to justify a grant of sick leave in lieu of the AWOL charged against the employee. In <span class="Italic">Zeiss v. VA</span>, 8 MSPR 15, 17-19, 7 MSPB 516 (1981) (clarified in <span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, <span class="Italic">Keesler v. Dept. of Transp</span>., and <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>), the only charge was AWOL, coupled with a past disciplinary record. The employee produced evidence of incapacitation for the first time at the Board hearing and the Board sustained the dismissal on what appeared to be an implied charge of failing to follow procedures governing leave requests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board subsequently reopened the case on its own motion, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117, to address the issue of "whether, in an AWOL based adverse action, an employee on appeal to the Board may rely upon medical evidence of illness not submitted to the agency as a defense to the action."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that pursuant to OPM regulations and the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), an agency is granted the authority and responsibility of determining an employee's entitlement to sick leave. Therefore, it contends that allowing an appellant to rely on evidence not previously submitted to the agency would frustrate the intent of the regulations and put the Board in the position of determining the propriety of leave requests. OPM contends that the proffered evidence is relevant only to the question of the propriety of the penalty chosen by the agency. It also argues that appellant's evidence, consciously withheld from the agency, cannot properly be considered by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Board has consistently rejected the notion that its scope of review is limited to that of appellate courts or to consideration of the administrative record established before the agency. <span class="Italic">Chavez v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 343, 349-50, 6 MSPR 404, 412-14 (1981); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 315-18, 5 MSPR 280, 286-90 (1981); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 497-99, 1 MSPR 505, 518-19 (1980); <span class="Italic">Toppi v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 2 MSPB 360, 2 MSPR 193 (1980). This Board is mandated by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) and (b) to conduct a hearing if requested by appellant, and to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all the relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record. Nothing in the law or in our regulations restricts an agency to reliance upon its documentary, administrative record, or withholds from that agency a full and fair opportunity to cross examine or otherwise rebut an appellant's evidence presented for the first time at the Board's hearing. <span class="Italic">See Chavez, supra</span>, 6 MSPB 350-51, 6 MSPR 414. We therefore find that an employee in an AWOL based adverse action, as in any other adverse action, may rely upon medical evidence of illness not previously submitted to the agency as a defense to the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will now examine the relevant evidence to determine if the presiding official erred in holding that the evidence presented by appellant for the first time at the hearing did not warrant reversal or reconsideration of the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 9, 1979, appellant informed the agency the he was sick. He did not contact the agency again during the relevant period. Upon returning to work on May 30, 1979, he informed the agency that he had been ill. Appellant was told to bring in a certificate from a doctor to substantiate the illness. He was also given a notice of proposed removal but the personnel office notified him that the proposal would be rescinded upon production of a doctor's certificate. By the date of the removal decision appellant had neither furnished the required medical evidence nor replied to the notice of proposed removal. For the first time at the hearing before the presiding official, appellant claimed that his absence was due to drug addiction withdrawal symptoms. His psychiatrist testified in support of this contention and stated that appellant was unable to work during the period of his absence. The presiding official sustained the agency action finding that, in light of the advice and opportunity given to appellant to submit medical evidence, the late submission of such evidence at the hearing did not warrant reconsideration of the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 630.401 an agency is required to grant sick leave in certain situations, including where, as here, an employee is incapacitated for the performance of his duties due to sickness. However, section 630.402 requires that an employee apply for sick leave within the time limits set by the agency, and section 630.403 provides that the agency may grant a request for sick leave only when such request is supported by administratively acceptable evidence. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 5 MSPB 456, 5 MSPR 45 (1981). The latter section also requires that if an absence lasts longer than three days, the agency may require, if it determines necessary, that an employee provide a medical certificate substantiating the reason for the absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2455"></span>The record reveals that appellant was notified numerous times between the date of his return and the date of the removal decision that in order to be granted sick leave and have the notice of proposed removal rescinded, it was necessary for him to produce a medical certificate explaining his absence. Appellant did not provide the agency with documentation of his illness by the date his removal decision was issued. The agency's charge of AWOL for 96 hours was a proper application of its procedures. <span class="Italic">See also Garrison</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 4 MSPB 173, 4 MSPR 87 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there may be circumstances where in an AWOL based adverse action submission of medical evidence of illness for the first time on appeal may be determinative of the outcome, we find that, in the instant case, the presiding official did not err in determining that the evidence presented by appellant did not warrant reversal or reconsideration of the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 307, 310 n.10 (1981), helped to clarify the distinction between disciplinary action sustained even though medical evidence of sickness is received at the Board hearing and a case that should instead be based upon failure to comply with rules or regulations governing the submission of documentation. The distinction in <span class="Italic">Nash</span> appeared to be drawn between the employee who fails to produce evidence to the agency prior to its decision on the adverse action and the individual who provides the information, belatedly, but before the agency decision is made:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cf. Zeiss v. Veterans Administration</span>, 7 MSPB 516, 8 MSPR 15 (1981). In that case the Board held that although there may be circumstances where in an AWOL based adverse action the submission of medical evidence of illness for the first time on appeal may be determinative of the outcome, the presiding official did not err in determining that medical evidence presented by the appellant in support of a sick leave request for the first time on appeal did not warrant a reversal or reconsideration of the agency's decision to remove him for AWOL. The Board based its holding in <span class="Italic">Zeiss</span> on findings that: (1) the agency told the appellant to bring in a certificate from a doctor to substantiate his alleged illness for 88 hours upon his return to work; (2) the appellant was also given a notice of proposed removal which the personnel office informed him would be rescinded upon production of a doctor's certificate, and (3) by the date of the removal decision appellant had neither furnished the required medical evidence nor replied to the notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, although appellant failed to submit the doctor's certificate in support of his illness promptly upon his return to duty (and in violation of the agency's sick leave procedures), he did submit the medical evidence <span class="Italic">prior</span> to the agency's decision to remove him and the agency erred in refusing to consider it. If the agency desired to discipline the appellant for his untimely submission, the proper procedure would not have been to propose[&#8197;] his removal for AWOL on the dates he was ill, but to charge him with disobeying agency directives and propose disciplinary action on that ground.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keesler v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 27, 28 n.1 (1983), qualifying <span class="Italic">Zeiss</span>, further clarified the right of an appellant to present medical evidence for the first time to the Board in response to an AWOL-related adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency contends that the presiding official erred by considering the appellant's testimony and medical evidence of illness submitted for the first time on appeal, the Board has determined that an employee in an adverse action based on unauthorized absence, as in any other adverse action, may rely upon medical evidence of illness not previously submitted to the agency as a defense to the action. <span class="Italic">See Bell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 15 MSPR 491 at 493 (1983); <span class="Italic">Nunes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 12 MSPB 20 at 21 (1982); <span class="Italic">Zeiss v. Veterans Administration,</span> 7 MSPB 516, 517 (1981). Appellant failed to present his evidence of illness at the agency level in response to the removal proposal, but his properly admissible evidence established at the hearing that he was incapacitated for duty and timely requested sick leave on the date on which he was charged with strike participation. Appellant's evidence rebutted the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of strike participation<span class="Italic">. See Bangerter v. Department of Transportation,</span> 16 MSPR 670 at 695 (1983). Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Zeiss,</span> 7 MSPB at 518, the medical evidence of illness submitted for the first time to the presiding official in the instant case is of sufficient weight to be determinative of the outcome....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 25, 32 (1998), sustaining removal for some AWOL, reiterated the law concerning presentation of evidence of incapacitation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of AWOL will not be sustained if the appellant presents evidence to the Board that was not previously presented to the agency showing that she was incapacitated for duty during the relevant time period<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Bishopp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 33, 39 (1997). If an employee has sufficient sick leave to cover the period in question, the agency must grant the leave request when the employee has provided administratively acceptable evidence of incapacitation because of illness or injury, regardless of whether the employee has complied with applicable leave procedures<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 648, 652 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thom v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 169, 172 &#x00B6; 6, 2010 MSPB 110 (2010) ("Even if the appellant failed to provide the September 16, 2005 medical certificate to the agency, we may properly consider it on review. <span class="Italic">See Wesley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 18 (2003) ('A charge of AWOL will not be sustained if the appellant presents evidence to the Board that was not previously presented to the agency showing that he was incapacitated for duty during the relevant time period.')"; still sustaining removal when the documentation did not adequately justify the absence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant was warned in a leave restriction letter that he should first have submitted evidence justifying sick leave to the agency but he did not produce that evidence until the Board hearing, the discipline for AWOL is likely to be sustained. <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 30 MSPR 343, 345-46 (1986) (treating the leave restriction as a warning demonstrating under <span class="Italic">Zeiss</span> that the AWOL charge was reasonable). <span class="Italic">Kulinski v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 574, 577-78 (1988), accepted medical evidence offered during the hearing to explain AWOL but found it insufficient to justify the absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, at the time in question, the appellant's mental condition was such that it adversely affected his ability to comply with the agency's instructions, then the AWOL charge was not properly sustained. <span class="Italic">See Villanueva v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 534, 536-37 (1985) (agency did not prove its charge of absence without leave where employee presented unrebutted medical evidence that his attendance problems were directly caused by a post-traumatic stress condition). On review of the meager medical evidence in this case, we find that it is insufficient to establish that, during the period he was charged AWOL, the appellant's mental condition prevented him from securing the medical examination that would have constituted compliance with the agency's instructions. Without evidence to show the nature and extent of the appellant's illness at the time he was charged AWOL, and how it affected him, we cannot find that he was unable, by virtue of his mental condition, to comply with the agency's instructions. <span class="Italic">See Mayers v. Government of the District of Columbia</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 144, 146 (1984) (failure of medical evidence proffered by employee to cover all dates of his absence would, without more, support decision to sustain employee's removal for absence without leave). We find, therefore, that the agency's charge of AWOL was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 393 &#x00B6; 36 (2004) (charge of AWOL can be defeated by the submission of medical evidence of incapacitation, even if that evidence is submitted for the first time at the hearing before the AJ; considering denial of emergency leave under 5 CFR 630.401(a)(3); medical documentation was insufficient evidence, however, of the conditions claimed in the leave request); <span class="Italic">Bishopp v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 33, 39 (1997) ("An appellant may defend against a charge of unauthorized absence by presenting evidence to the Board that was not previously presented to the agency, showing that he or she was incapacitated for duty during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kulinski v.

We find, based on the appellant's unrebutted evidence, that she was incapacitated for duty, and that she should have been placed on approved leave from 12:30 <span class="small">P.M</span>. until 3:00 <span class="small">P.M</span>. on November 2. Thus, this charge is not sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Veterans Administration</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 412 (1987) (based in part on medical evidence presented for the first time in the Board appeal, a charge of absence without leave was not sustained; the appellant was mentally ill during her absences, and was entitled to sick leave); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Kmiecz v.

The very illness which entitled appellant to a grant of excused leave also made it impossible for her to follow the agency's leave administration regulations."); <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 601, 603 (1984) (employee may offer evidence at the Board hearing of illness, even though the evidence was not previously provided to the agency; sustaining removal for unjustified absences); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Owens v.

Cir. 2009 NP) (arbitrator could properly determine that an employee's leave request should have been honored and that the employee should be reinstated, but without back pay, upon presentation to the employer of medical clearance for unrestricted employment); <span class="Italic">Hodges v. DOJ</span>, 121 MSPR 337, 2014 MSPB 54 (2014) (noting the agency's restoration of an employee whose physician testified at the hearing that the appellant was medically cleared to return to work; denying back pay for the period appellant could not work because of his medical condition); <span class="Italic">Sanders v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McKinney v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 412, 414-15 (1987), determined that AWOL was excused by a past medical condition, that the condition precluded timely compliance with agency documentation requirements, and that the appellant apparently recovered by the time of the hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an agency properly considered an employee <span id="Page_2456"></span>AWOL, the Board may examine both the medical evidence presented to the agency and evidence submitted for the first time before the Board on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 561 (1983), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds in</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the nature of appellant's mental condition excused her failure to follow the agency's procedure for requesting sick leave. Appellant testified that she now realizes that she acted irresponsibly at the time, but was not sufficiently in control of herself during the period in question to follow the proper procedures....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bowman v. Bowman v. SBA,</span> 122 MSPR 217, 222-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 13-14, 2015 MSPB 18 (2015) (Member Robbins dissenting), reaffirmed the significance of medical evidence first offered to the Board in an appeal involving AWOL and failure to following leave reporting procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is some support in the cases relied on by the administrative judge for the proposition that mitigating factors based on an appellant's medical condition will be considered only if they were made known to the agency before the adverse action was effected. For example, in <span class="Italic">Roseman</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 345, the Board stated that evidence that an employee's medical condition or mental impairment played a part in the charged conduct is ordinarily entitled to considerable weight as a mitigating factor. The Board held that, even where the condition does not rise to the level of a disability, "<span class="Italic">if the agency knew about it before taking the action at issue</span>, we may consider the condition in determining the appropriate penalty." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The Board reiterated this statement in <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the above-quoted language, any doubt about the relevance of the appellant's testimony regarding the connection between his mental condition and the absences which formed the basis for the charges in this matter was eliminated by our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2012). In that case, the court held that an arbitrator erred by stating that the issue before him was whether the penalty was within tolerable limits of reasonableness "based upon the facts and circumstances <span class="Italic">known to [the deciding official]</span> at the time." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352, 1357 (emphasis in original). Emphasizing the <span class="Italic">de novo</span> nature of Board proceedings, the court held that where new evidence supporting mitigation of the penalty is presented to the Board, the evidence must be considered in determining whether the agency's penalty was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1355-57. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's hearing testimony that his depression played a part in his absences prior to his hospitalization on December 15, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit observed in <span class="Italic">Reilly v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 571 F.3d 1372, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2009), "[t]he field of forensic medicine abounds with examples of subsequent medical documentation relevant to a prior condition. As a classic example, inferences about prior intoxication can be drawn from blood alcohol tests conducted at a later time." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Other courts have reached the same conclusion in analogous contexts. <span class="Italic">See Pollard v. Halter</span>, 377 F.3d 183, 193-94 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding in the context of a case involving Social Security disability benefits that "evidence bearing upon an applicant's condition subsequent to the date upon which the earning requirement...was last met is pertinent evidence in that it may disclose the severity and continuity of impairments existing before the earning requirement date") (internal quotation omitted); <span class="Italic">Ivy v. Sullivan</span>, 898 F.2d 1045, 1049 (5th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that "noncontemporaneous medical records are relevant to the determination of whether onset occurred on the date alleged by the claimant" in the context of Social Security disability benefits); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Bowen</span>, 849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting that "[i]t is obvious that medical reports are inevitably rendered retrospectively and should not be disregarded solely on that basis"); <span class="Italic">Basinger v. Heckler</span>, 725 F.2d 1166, 1169 (8th Cir. 1984) (finding that "medical evidence of a claimant's condition subsequent to the expiration of the claimant's insured status is relevant evidence because it may bear upon the severity of the claimant's condition before the expiration of his or her insured status"); <span class="Italic">Beckham v. United States</span>, 392 F.2d 619, 625 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (determining that "we must look to manifestations of the disease or ailment appearing both before and after the point in time of separation" to determine fitness at the time of separation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, proximity in time, testimony, or other evidence provides the requisite link to the relevant period, the subsequent medical evidence can be very probative of a prior medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Reilly</span>, 571 F.3d at 1382. Here, the medical evidence in the record corroborates the appellant's testimony that his mental illness played a significant part in his absence. <span class="Italic">See Allen v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 564, 568 (1997) (accepting evidence from a clinical psychologist supporting a psychological illness and related absence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence submitted to the Board must be persuasive. Removal was sustained for an employee whose medical certificates were insufficiently detailed and whose absence had no foreseeable end, despite a proffer of medical evidence at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Cresson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 178, 182 (1987).
