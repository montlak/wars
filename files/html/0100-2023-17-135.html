<p class="noindent">If the parties allow the arbitrator to formulate the issues in his award, and if the arbitrator states an issue to be the appropriate remedy, the parties have no complaint when the arbitrator proceeds to fashion a remedy, for example, by directing the parties to attempt to resolve their dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 922, 924 (2010) ("The Authority has held that arbitrators enjoy broad discretion in fashioning remedies, particularly where, as here, the parties specifically authorize the arbitrator to determine the appropriate remedy for a violation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 62 FLRA 59, 62 (2007)."); <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 3320</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-67.html">73 FLRA 342</a>, 345 (2022) (Member Kiko dissenting) (in the absence of a stipulated issue, the arbitrator properly decided the remedy to require when his award reduced a disciplinary suspension: "The Authority has held that where, as here, the parties fail to stipulate to an issue, arbitrators may formulate the issues based on the subject matter before them. In those circumstances, the Authority examines whether the award is directly responsive to the issue that the arbitrator framed. Further, the Authority has held that arbitrators enjoy broad discretion in fashioning remedies, particularly where the parties specifically authorized the arbitrator to determine the appropriate remedy for a violation. Moreover, a remedy is not deficient merely because a party did not request it."); <span class="Italic">SSA Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 55 FLRA 498, 503 (1999) ("Here, the parties did not stipulate the issues to be resolved, thus allowing the Arbitrator to formulate the issues in his award. In this regard, the Arbitrator framed one of the issues as whether the Agency was justified in ordering the Union to turn over its survey results, and '[i]f not, what shall be the remedy?'...&#8197;[T]he Arbitrator remanded the grievance to the parties 'for the limited purpose of affording them an opportunity to review these matters and, hopefully, to reach an understanding which will respect and take into account the legitimate interests of each [p]arty with regard to security.' In our view, the award, including the Arbitrator's formulation of the remedy, is directly responsive to the Arbitrator's framing of the issue."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and SSA</span>, 58 FLRA 376, 377 (2003) (when arbitrator was permitted to frame issue as appropriateness of agency's disciplinary actions against several grievants, he could respond by remanding cases to agency for consideration and application of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation factors); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-61.html">73 FLRA 315</a>, 321–22 (2022) (Chairman DuBester concurring) ("Therefore, the remedy--requiring the Agency to rescind and 'rerun' the suspensions of Wright and Casner--is directly responsive to the question of appropriate remedies for the Agency's violation of the Statute and the 2010 CBA.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if the arbitrator has the discretion to frame the issues, he is not without some limitations in his decisional process.

<p class="noindent">"[A]lthough an arbitrator may not award relief to non-grievants, the mere fact that an arbitrator's remedy affects non-grievants does not demonstrate that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Louisville, Ky.</span>, 65 FLRA 787, 790 (2011)." <span class="Italic">DODDS-Europe and FEA</span>, 66 FLRA 181, 184 (2011). If the arbitrator is considering a union grievance, the award does not fail to draw its essence from the agreement because the award extends relief to some individuals embraced by the grievance but not yet identified by the grievance or the award, <span class="Italic">DCMA and AFGE Council 170</span>, 66 FLRA 53, 57 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's fifth essence contention is that the Arbitrator "add[ed] language [by] affording...remedies" to individuals who lack standing because they "remain unidentified and have suffered no proven harm." The Agency cites no agreement provision that precludes the Arbitrator from awarding relief to unspecified individuals where the grievance was filed on their behalf by the Union. Further, to the extent that the Agency's argument is a reiteration of its aforementioned claim that the awards "ignor[e] the contractual requirement that individual grievants be identified along with their injuries, as set forth in [A]rticle 30, Section 6," it provides no basis for finding the award deficient on essence grounds. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the issue defined by the arbitrator involves the grievance for one employee, a remedy that goes on to address a more general concern involving administration of the contract may be set aside as beyond the authority of the arbitrator, as in <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 66 FLRA 62, 66 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority when she issued remedies that went beyond the scope of the matter submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency objects to the award's direction to restore its prior federal holiday leave policy, and revisit leave decisions already made for future holidays.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue, or the arbitrator's formulation of an issue to be decided in the absence of a stipulation, the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 982, 986 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Info. Agency, Voice of Am.</span>, 55 FLRA 197 (1999)). Nevertheless, if a grievance is limited to a particular grievant, then the remedy must be similarly limited. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div., </span>65 FLRA 131, 133-34 (2010) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Corps of Eng'rs</span>). Further, an arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when he or she finds no violation, but nevertheless awards a remedy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Sea Logistics Ctr., Detachment Atl., Indian Head, Md</span>., 57 FLRA 687, 688-89 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Indian Head). </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the CBA by denying the <span class="Italic">grievant's </span>request for annual leave, but she rejected the Union's claim that the Agency acted improperly by discontinuing the two-thirds policy. As remedies, she directed the Agency to restore the policy and to revisit leave decisions made for future holidays. However, the Arbitrator did not find, and there is no basis for concluding, that the remedies were related in any way to the Agency's denial of the grievant's leave request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, the Arbitrator's remedies are deficient for two reasons. First, <span id="page_1902"></span>they relate to an action that was not found to be improper. Specifically, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency violated the CBA when it discontinued the two-thirds policy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Indian Head</span>, 57 FLRA at 688-89. Second, the remedies extend to non-grievants. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Corps of Eng'rs, </span>65 FLRA at 133-34. For these reasons, we find that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by awarding these remedies, and we set them aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases where the Authority sets aside an entire remedy, but leaves undisturbed an arbitrator's finding of an underlying violation, the Authority remands the award for determination of an alternative remedy. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 65 FLRA 433, 436 (2011). Consistent with the above cited precedent, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to formulate an alternative remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, an arbitrator exceeded his authority by fashioning an otherwise unobjectionable order that extended beyond the grievants, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Local 141</span>, 69 FLRA 244, 246 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by directing the Agency to treat "all future [<span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> leave] requests," including those submitted by "similarly situated" officers, consistent with the award. Arbitrators exceed their authority, as relevant here, when they resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance.[47] In this regard, if a grievance is limited to a particular grievant, then the remedy must be similarly limited.[48]</p>

Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance.[95] However, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue, or the arbitrator's formulation of an issue to be decided in the absence of a stipulation, the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective-bargaining agreement.[96] Nevertheless, if a grievance is limited to a particular grievant, then the remedy must be similarly limited.[97]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the parties did not agree to a stipulated issue. The Arbitrator framed the issue as whether the Agency complied with the parties' agreement and the AFI and, if not, "what is the appropriate remedy?" The Arbitrator resolved the issue, finding that the Agency failed to conduct an investigation, as required by the parties' agreement, before issuing the grievant the admonishment. The Arbitrator further determined that the "appropriate remedy" was to direct the Agency to "cease and desist" from issuing admonishments without seeking "input from the [affected] employee...and [permitting] the involvement of a Union representative." Because the awarded remedy is directly responsive to the issue as framed by the Arbitrator--and it is well established that an arbitrator may prospectively direct an agency to comply with a violated contract provision[103]--we find that the Agency has failed to show that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority on this basis.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">However, the Union filed the grievance on behalf of the grievant only.

Further, the Arbitrator did not find that issues regarding the disputed duties necessarily arose from the stipulated issue of the propriety of the suspension, and she did not interpret the stipulation to encompass such issues. Moreover, the Arbitrator made no finding that review of the disputed duties was based on, or related to, the improper suspension, and the Union provides no basis for finding that reinstatement of the disputed duties was necessary to make the grievant whole. In sum, the record provides no basis for authorizing the Arbitrator to address the disputed duties. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator failed to confine her decision and remedies to the merits issue submitted by the parties to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Mint,</span> 60 FLRA at 779.

<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue, or the arbitrator's formulation of an issue to be decided in the absence of a stipulation, the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 982, 986 (2010) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Info. Agency, Voice of Am.</span>, 55 FLRA 197 (1999). Nevertheless, if a grievance is limited to a particular grievant, then the remedy must be similarly limited. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge Office, Oak Ridge, Tenn., </span>64 FLRA 535, 538 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Ctr., Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</span>, 45 FLRA 1234, 1240 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>)<span class="Italic">. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the stipulated issue before the Arbitrator was: "Whether the Agency violated the [CBA] and/or relevant law when it denied [<span class="Italic">the grievant's</span>] May, 2009 request for official time. If so, what is the remedy?" The Arbitrator resolved this issue by determining that the parties were contractually bound to implement the "[A]sterisk [P]rocedure beginning on the date the Hauck [A]ward issued until they are able to reach agreement on [new] procedures." Moreover, the Arbitrator's remedy requiring the Agency to implement the Asterisk Procedure until the parties are able to reach agreement on procedures is directly responsive to the issue. In this connection, it is well established that, where an arbitrator has found a contractual violation with regard to a particular agency action, the arbitrator may direct prospective relief, including directing the agency to comply with the violated contract provision in conducting future actions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Air Force Space Div., L.A. Air Force Station, Cal.</span>, 24 FLRA 516, 517-20 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as set forth above, the grievance involved only the grievant's requests for official time. The Arbitrator, therefore, was authorized to award relief to the grievant only. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Energy, </span>64 FLRA at 538; <span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>, 45 FLRA at 1240. The Arbitrator's remedy, however, directs the Agency to implement the Asterisk Procedure <span class="Italic">generally </span>and does not limit its application to the grievant. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 14 (directing the Agency to "implement the [A]sterisk [P]rocedure beginning on October 26, 2009, the date the Hauck [A]ward issued, until the parties are able to reach agreement on procedures for requesting official time."). Insofar as the award provides a remedy that applies to individuals other than the grievant, the award exceeds the Arbitrator's authority. Accordingly, we modify the award to clarify that this requirement applies only to the grievant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy, </span>64 FLRA at 538, and the cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="noindent">The remedy of a posting may be a problem. <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Local 3911</span>, 59 FLRA 520, 525-26 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting), involved an individual grievant who asserted contract violations and reprisal. As part of his remedy, the arbitrator directed a remedy that included a requirement that the agency post on bulletin boards a copy of the arbitrator's directive that the agency "cease <span id="page_1904"></span>and desist from taking reprisals against employees who file grievances." FLRA set the posting requirement aside, concluding that the arbitrator exceeded his authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority when the arbitrator fails to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolves an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregards specific limitations on his or her authority, or awards relief to persons who are not encompassed by the grievance<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Defense, Army &#x0026; Air Force Exch. Serv.</span>, 51 FLRA 1371, 1378 (1996). In the absence of a stipulation by the parties of the issues to be decided, arbitrators are accorded substantial deference in the formation of issues to be resolved in an arbitration proceeding<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Local 1637</span>, 49 FLRA 125, 130 (1994) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1637</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's first argument, that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator's posting remedy exceeds his authority by awarding a remedy to persons not included in the grievance, the Authority has found awards deficient on the ground that an arbitral remedy is too broad<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, Okla. City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB, Okla.</span>, 42 FLRA 680, 685 (1991). This is particularly true where the grievance pertained to particular employees and the remedy applies to individuals not included among those employees<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 685-86. In particular, the Authority has held, on these grounds, that a remedy including a posting exceeded the arbitrator's authority because it defined the rights of employees beyond the grievant<span class="Italic">. See United States Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 57 FLRA 648, 651-52 (2001) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>). On the other hand, the Authority has upheld an award, challenged on exceeded authority grounds, which required the union to post a notice acknowledging that it had violated the contract<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr</span>., 35 FLRA 1175, 1178 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Essentially, the Arbitrator's posting remedy was designed to ensure that the Agency complied with its own prohibitions concerning reprisal against employees for exercising rights under the Statute. Thus, the award was not limited to requiring the Agency to cease and desist from acting in reprisal against the grievant for her exercise of rights under the Statute, but against all employees who exercised such rights. The only employee whose rights were adjudicated in this case was the grievant, but the award established a right against reprisal for all Agency employees. Therefore, the Arbitrator's award defined the rights of employees other than the grievant and exceeded his authority<span class="Italic">. See EPA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pope expressed the better view in her dissent in the 2003 <span class="Italic">EPA </span>decision, 59 FLRA at 527:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I agree with the majority in all respects except one.&#x2003;In particular, I do not agree that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by ordering that the Agency post a notice. In this regard, the grievance asserted that the Agency's failure to name the grievant as MCO constituted a reprisal for filing a grievance and that the reprisal violated an Agency regulation prohibiting reprisal "for exercising a right provided under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 71 (governing Federal labor-management relations)." The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated the regulation and directed the Agency to follow the regulation, to cease and desist from taking reprisals against employees, and to post a notice reflecting that it would comply with these two requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority and the Federal courts have consistently emphasized the broad discretion accorded arbitrators in fashioning appropriate remedies<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of the Interior, United States Geological Survey Nat'l Mapping Div. Mapping Applications Center, </span>55 FLRA 30, 33 (1998)<span class="Italic">; Air Force Space Division, Los Angeles Air Force Station, Cal., </span>24 FLRA 516, 519 (1986) <span class="Italic">(AFSD)</span>. As relevant here, remedies may address issues beyond those pertaining to an individual grievant where the dispute before the arbitrator also encompasses that issue<span class="Italic">. Id. </span>at 519. Further, the Authority has upheld arbitral awards requiring a notice posting in cases where the Agency engaged in conduct that violated the Statute<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">General Services Administration, </span>53 FLRA 925, 933 (1997). The Authority also routinely requires a notice posting in unfair labor practice cases, including those involving alleged unlawful retaliation<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Arbitrator's broad remedial authority and the routine nature of a posting in situations where an agency has engaged in prohibited reprisal, I find no reason to prohibit the Arbitrator from providing that remedy here. This is particularly true, in my view, because the Agency violated a regulation that specifically incorporates the Statute. In reaching a contrary conclusion, the majority relies on precedent indicating that an arbitrator exceeds his/her authority by issuing an order that "define[s] the rights of employees beyond the grievant." Majority Opinion at 15 (<span class="Italic">citing United States Environmental Protection Agency, </span>57 FLRA 648, 651-52 (2001)). I believe this reliance is misplaced because here, the employees rights are defined not by the Arbitrator, but by the regulation. Requiring the Agency to certify that it will comply with those rights in no way "defines" them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See EPA and AFGE Local 3911</span>, 57 FLRA 648, 651-52 (2001) (arbitrator exceeded his authority by issuing cease and desist order and by directing agency to post notice in various offices to cure violation of contract provisions concerning supervisor's treatment of single employee's performance appraisal; if grievance is limited to particular a grievant, remedy must be similarly limited).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of environmental differential pay to persons who did not grieve that denial exceeded the authority of the arbitrator. He essentially decided an issue not submitted. <span class="Italic">Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 18 FLRA 899, 901 (1985). An arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding an issue not presented to him and awarding relief to an employee who did not grieve and who did not have the union file a grievance for him. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ctr. for Toxicological Research, Jefferson and AFGE Local 3393, NCTR Jefferson</span>, 20 FLRA 692, 693 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Army Academy of Health Sciences, Ft. Sam Houston and NFFE Local 28</span>, 34 FLRA 598, 600 (1990) (arbitrator exceeded authority by deciding case based on grievant's flexitime schedule through award that required management to take action affecting employees not involved in grievance); <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 27 FLRA 435, 438-39 (1987) (arbitrator exceeded authority by deciding issue involving all agency employees, rather than only grievant, when that issue was not presented by stipulation of issues).</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision limiting remedies for a single grievant are distinguished from remedies for what amounts to a group grievance. An award involving a somewhat unspecific number of employees is not invalid if it is clear that the grievance and the arbitration proceedings that followed were designed to establish entitlement of a class of employees to a benefit, e.g., temporary promotion, a uniform allowance, or environmental differential pay<span class="Italic">.

We note also that neither the Agency nor the Union raised the issue of coverage before the Authority.

The Agency has not established that the Arbitrator provided relief to persons not included in the grievance."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 58 FLRA 750, 759 (2003) ("The award does not set forth any findings or provide any relief with regard to any particular employees. As such, there is no basis for concluding that the award concerns employees not named in the grievance and therefore, fails to draw its essence from...the agreement."). Nothing prevents a union from grieving on behalf of an entire bargaining unit. If the unit's grievance is sustained, the arbitrator may direct management to provide information demonstrating its treatment of unit members and the arbitrator may then review treatment of those individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey and NFFE Local 1309</span>, 55 FLRA 30, 33 (1998) (grievance concerning performance appraisals). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS Kansas City Campus and NTEU Chap. 66</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-221.html">71 FLRA 1161</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (arbitrator improperly awarded relief to group of employees, rather than one grievant, when the contract procedure for institutional grievances was not followed).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA does not unduly restrict an arbitrator's discretionary remedial authority. An arbitrator stated the issue to be whether the agency violated its agreement in the manner that it filled a unit position. The remedy ordered by the arbitrator required the employer to comply with the agreement "on any and all future openings pursuant to the locally negotiated Labor Agreement." The remedy was unobjectionable, <span class="Italic">Air Force Space Div., Los Angeles Air Force Station and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 24 FLRA 516, 518, 519-20 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e note the Arbitrator's refusal to adopt the Activity's formulation of the issue, which would have expressly limited the matter to the grievant and the specific selection action, and further note the extent of this matter as considered and litigated by the parties. The parties themselves, as evidenced by the Union's statement of the issue and requested remedy and the Activity's step 1 and 3 answers, have indicated that this matter extended to whether the promotion procedures of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and negotiated merit promotion plan covered selections for career program vacancies. Thus, we conclude that the Arbitrator appropriately viewed the dispute before him as encompassing the question as to whether career program vacancies were excluded from coverage of the parties agreement and negotiated merit promotion plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to <span class="Italic">National INS Council</span>, on which the Agency relies, the Arbitrator in this case has not improperly transformed the proceeding into a "sort of class action."...&#8197;To the contrary, when a matter in dispute <span id="page_1905"></span>concerns a management practice and policy generally applicable to the entire bargaining unit, federal courts have specifically viewed the arbitrator's authority to be quite broad and have upheld relief from the disputed employment practice or policy which encompasses similarly situated employees....&#8197;Likewise, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Facility, Fort Worth</span>, 17 FLRA 278 (1985), on which the Agency also relies, where the issue necessarily was one of just cause for the discipline of an individual employee, careful review of the pertinent aspects of the record in this case does not evidence a limitation on the authority of the Arbitrator to consider the filling of only the budget analyst position which precipitated the grievance....</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2382 and VA Hayden Med. Ctr.</span>, 58 FLRA 270, 271-72 (2002), an arbitrator set aside a one-day suspension for failure to comply with procedures governing sick leave administration and directed that the suspension be reduced to a final warning that another similar instance could result in summary termination. The parties stipulated that the arbitrator would determine whether the suspension was justified and, if not, allowed the arbitrator to determine the appropriate penalty. FLRA found unjustified the union's concern that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by creating a type of last chance condition upon the grievant's continued employment. The award did not dictate a future penalty; instead it left the penalty to the agency and deprived the grievant of none of the due process that he would receive under statute or regulation should action be taken against him in the future.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 29 FLRA 225, 226 (1987), the issue was whether a reprimand was issued for just cause and what the remedy should be. The arbitrator sustained the grievance and directed expungement of the reprimand and transfer of the grievant to another module. On exceptions the agency claimed the arbitrator exceeded his authority by considering the grievant's assigned work location. FLRA disagreed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency fails to establish that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by deciding an issue not submitted.&#x2003;There is no indication in the record before us that the parties by joint stipulation of an issue or by submission agreement specifically precluded the Arbitrator from fashioning the remedy he did. Rather, the Arbitrator framed the issue for arbitration, and he specifically included the question of an appropriate remedy. In his award the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and as the remedy ordered that the grievant's reprimand be removed from the Agency's records and that he be transferred to another module. Thus, contrary to the Agency's contention, the Arbitrator's award concerning the grievant's transfer is directly responsive to and properly confined to the issue as the Arbitrator framed it....</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award was sustained that awarded back pay to a retiree. The issue before the arbitrator was whether the contract was violated and, if so, what the remedy should be. The arbitrator's award was responsive to the stipulated issue and within his authority to make. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Region and IBEW Local 1759</span>, 42 FLRA 902, 914 (1991). An award directing construction of facilities for smokers was sustained. FLRA noted that arbitrators have "great latitude" in fashioning remedies. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Kerrville and AFGE Local 2281</span>, 45 FLRA 457, 467 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB</span>, 57 FLRA 715, 717 (2002) (great latitude). <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 49 FLRA 658, 663 (1994), reprised the theme:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has specifically held that an arbitrator's award will be found deficient as in excess of the arbitrator's authority when the arbitrator resolves an issue not submitted to arbitration. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Force Space Division, Los Angeles Air Force Station, California and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2429</span>, 24 FLRA 516, 518 (1986). However, in reviewing awards to determine whether arbitrators exceeded their authority, we accord an arbitrator's formulation of the issue submitted in the absence of a stipulation by the parties the same substantial deference accorded an arbitrator's interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In addition, we permit an arbitrator to extend the award to issues that necessarily arise from the issue as formulated by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 519. Furthermore, when the exception concerns whether the remedy awarded by the arbitrator exceeded the arbitrator's authority, we grant the arbitrator broad discretion to fashion a remedy that the arbitrator considers to be appropriate<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See Dept. of Labor, BLS and AFGE Local 12</span>, 59 FLRA 533 (2003) (emphasizing remedial discretion: arbitrator directed establishment of joint committee, ergonomics training); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees</span>, 58 FLRA 490, 493 (2003) (emphasizing remedial discretion of arbitrator).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA examines the arbitrator's jurisdiction with some practicality. The arbitrator may decide procedural issues, e.g., the place of a hearing, that are inherent in the nature of arbitration cases even though the precise procedural issue decided is not contained in a submission agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Griffiss AFB, Rome and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 39 FLRA 1117, 1123 (1991). The arbitrator does not exceed his authority if he decides an issue, e.g., fairness of a performance standard, that is integrally related to the issue before him, e.g., whether placement of the grievant on a PIP violated the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 47 FLRA 1326, 1330-31 (1993). The arbitrator will not be faulted if, in fashioning a remedy, he recommends a course of voluntary action by the agency or appeals by the union to higher agency authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 44 FLRA 806, 812 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award is not invalid because it provides relief to an individual other than the grievant if the relief is related to the grievant's claim and if the agency was put on fair notice of the issue. It is not unheard of in arbitration cases that the grievant's representative becomes embroiled in controversy with the agency over official time spent pursuing the grievance. The grievant wants relief on his case. The representative wants official time. The arbitrator ends up resolving both issues, even though official time is not part of the grievance as it was initially formulated. FLRA denied exceptions to an award that dealt with the grievance on the merits and with an official time claim that arose during the processing of the grievance, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 47 FLRA 692, 698-700 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award in this case is distinguishable from awards that have been found deficient on the basis that arbitrators resolved matters or awarded relief based on issues that were not stipulated by the parties for resolution by the arbitrator....&#8197;This case is also distinguishable from cases in which awards were deficient because the arbitrator resolved issues that were not encompassed within the grievance or had not been raised in any other manner before the arbitrator....&#8197;Finally, this case can be distinguished from <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Prison System, Federal Correctional Facility, Fort Worth, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1298, AFL-CIO</span>, 17 FLRA 278 (1985). In that case, an arbitrator was found to have exceeded his authority by fashioning a remedy that went beyond the scope of the grievance and the issue as formulated by the arbitrator. The Authority found that although evidence was presented by the union to support the remedy, the evidence was relevant only to proving the claim set forth in the grievance and the union clearly had requested a remedy that was limited to the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the cases cited above, the issue regarding official time for use by the grievant's representative, although not explicitly referenced in the grievance itself, was raised by the parties before the Arbitrator and was included in the issue formulated by the Arbitrator. In addition, the parties were given the opportunity, both at the arbitration hearing and in post-hearing submissions, to address the issue. As a result, the parties had an opportunity to argue the merits of the issue before the Arbitrator and cannot be viewed as having been harmed by the Arbitrator's resolution of the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague appears to draw a distinction between an arbitrator's ability to formulate issues, which our colleague readily acknowledges may be done in the absence of a stipulated issue, and an arbitrator's ability to provide remedial relief connected with that issue. For this reason, our colleague states that an award will be found deficient when the arbitrator "'issues an affirmative order that exceeds the scope of the matter submitted to arbitration <span class="Italic">or</span> awards relief to persons who did not file a grievance on their own behalf and did not have the union file a grievance for them.'"...&#8197;We do not view this as a rigid dual-pronged test; rather, it is meant to indicate examples of instances where arbitrators exceed their authority in the circumstances of a given case. As we stated above, we find that this award is sufficiently related to both the initial grievance and the issues formulated by the Arbitrator. Specifically, we find no support for the proposition that awarding relief to a non-grievant, in and of itself, is grounds for finding an award deficient without regard to whether such relief is predicated on the issue before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There can be no doubt that when an issue relates to asserted improper conduct by an agency, an arbitrator is well within his or her authority to provide relief to an employee who was harmed by that conduct. Further, it is consistent with Authority precedent for an arbitrator to formulate a disputed issue and to resolve that issue by rendering an affirmative remedy. That is precisely what occurred in this case. Our dissenting colleague quite simply overlooks the link between the Arbitrator's formulation of an issue and the remedial relief that was predicated on the resolution of that issue. This is not to say that an award that orders relief to non-grievants could not be found deficient. Indeed, if the Arbitrator had awarded official time to other Union representatives when the issue related solely to the use of official time by the grievant's representative then the Arbitrator would have exceeded his authority by awarding a remedy that did not comport with the formulated issue. On that, we would agree with our colleague. However, to the extent our colleague is of the opinion that the relief awarded by the Arbitrator was improper because the grievant was not, in any rational way, the focus of the relief granted or because the award did not address the injury complained of in the grievance, we respectfully disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may provide alternative remedies. FLRA may strike one of the remedies as inappropriate, but leave the other remedy undisturbed. <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv. and AFGE Local 3157</span>, 58 FLRA 98, 100 (2002) (alternate remedies were provided to remedy management's violation of contract overtime provisions).</p>
