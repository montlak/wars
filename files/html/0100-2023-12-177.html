<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-176"><span class="space">g.</span> Ignorance of Law; Late Discovery of Legal Defense; Subsequent MSPB Decision in Another Case</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Ignorance of the law does not warrant waiving the PFR filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Crook v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 553, 555 &#x00B6; 6, 2008 MSPB 86 (2008). A late PFR is not excused because the appellant asserts that he was not "schooled in the intricacies of appellate practice." <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 255, 256 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 106 MSPR 405, 408 &#x00B6; 8, 2007 MSPB 192 (2007) (not excusing late PFR by <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who asserted that he "did not know how to file a petition" <span id="Page_1763"></span>when the initial decision "advised the appellant, in plain language, of the time limit and procedures for obtaining Board review"); <span class="Italic">Arrasmith v. USDA</span>, 89 MSPR 577, 580 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) ("[W]hile appellant asserts that the agency withheld information relevant to his appeal until after the parties entered into the settlement agreement, he provides no details regarding the nature of the purportedly withheld information or how it would explain the lengthy delay in filing his petition for review."); <span class="Italic">Sledge v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 413, 415 (1990) (late PFR was not excused because the appellant was "not knowledgeable in the law, and did not understand all of the requirements of having the Board consider this matter"); <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 168, 169 (1985) (declining to excuse a delay of three years in filing a PFR because the appellant had only recently encountered former acquaintances from the workplace who told him he might have a case); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 9 (1994) (appellant's discouragement at the likely outcome of a PFR does not establish good cause for a waiver of the PFR deadline). Conversely, past experience with Board proceedings may weigh against waiver of the PFR deadline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, AT-3443-07-0016-C-2 (NP 3/3/2023) ("The Board has found that when, as here, an appellant with significant prior experience with Board procedures claims that he did not receive documents, his past experience should have alerted the appellant as to possible problems regarding service of documents, and his failure to note these problems breached his personal duty to monitor the progress of his appeals at all times. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Social Security Administration,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 10 (2009).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As long as an appellant is aware of appeal rights, late discovery of a legal defense does not excuse untimely filing of a PFR. <span class="Italic">Shane v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 1 MSPR 720, 721, 2 MSPB 128 (1980). Conclusory statements that an appellant delayed filing a PFR because of inability to obtain information to substantiate his legal position do not serve as good cause to extend the filing period. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 10, 11, 3 MSPB 132 (1980). The same result occurs if the appellant delayed filing his PFR because he was gathering arguments to support the PFR, <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 217, 219 (1987), or because he delayed to engage in further investigation and analysis, <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164, 168 (1990). An appellant's late PFR is not excused because the appellant desires to determine if the agency will take action against another employee who, the appellant contends, was similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shimmin v. DOJ</span>, 63 MSPR 435, 438-39 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay is not excused by the belated recognition of the significance of the Board appellate process. <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 572, 574 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Katovich v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-0752-10-0904-I-1 (NP 10/23/2012), similarly stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the nearly 13-month delay is substantial, and the appellant has not shown that he acted with due diligence or ordinary prudence or that there were circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limit. Although the appellant contends that he felt he had "no recourse" after the administrative judge dismissed his appeal, this does not establish good cause for the extensive delay. <span class="Italic">See Wileman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 232, 238 (1995) (an appellant's discouragement at the likely outcome of a petition for review did not establish good cause for a filing delay), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 86 F.3d 1178 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the discovery of, or a decision to pursue, a new legal argument after the period for filing a petition for review has expired does not constitute good cause for a filing delay. <span class="Italic">Jones v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant has not established a basis to reopen this appeal. The Board generally exercises its authority to reopen an appeal only within a short and reasonable time period, and this time period is usually measured in weeks rather than years. <span class="Italic">See Tarrant v. Department of Transportation</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 308, &#x00B6; 4 (2000). As set forth above, the appellant filed his petition for review and request to reopen over 1 year after the initial decision became final. The Board may exercise its discretionary authority to reopen an appeal when there has been a change in controlling law after the issuance of the Board's final decision<span class="Italic">. Stevenson v. Department of Defense</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 625, 629 (1992), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Perez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 503 (1997). This case does not, however, involve a change in controlling law. Rather, the Board in <span class="Italic">Arrington</span> decided a novel legal issue that could have been challenged by the appellant in the first instance had he filed a timely petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 289, 292-93 (1994). Moreover, the Board will not reopen an appeal when the party requesting reopening fails to exercise due diligence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 214, 219 (1996). The appellant has not shown such due diligence in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Cipolla v. MSPB</span>, 68 Fed. Appx. 202, 203 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), "[a] subsequent change in law does not render incorrect a decision that correctly applied the previous law. Thus, waiting for legal or policy change is not good cause for the extensive delay...." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 109, 112 (1995) ("[T]he issuance of even a precedential decision after the expiration of the time period for filing a petition for review does not establish good cause for waiver of the time limit."); <span class="Italic">McDonnell v.

<p class="Body-Text">An unusual situation, involving a statute that stripped appellants of the ability to seek MSPB review of an AJ's initial decision arose in <span class="Italic">Talton v. VA</span>, AT-0707-15-0094-J-1 (NP 2/10/2023), considering removal of an SES member at the VA. After the appellant's removal was affirmed, the Federal Circuit decided in another case that the section of the statute placing sole review authority in the AJ was unconstitutional. Mr. Talton then filed a PFR. Given the circumstances and the prompt filing of the PFR by Mr. Talton after the Federal Circuit's decision, MSPB deemed the PFR timely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issuance of an initial decision in another case does not excuse late filing of a PFR; nor does a decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority that has some impact on the defenses raised by the appellant appear to mitigate a belated PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">West v. EEOC</span>, 63 MSPR 233, 235 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 5, 7 (1987), the Board refused to allow an untimely PFR that was arguably based on a change in law governing counsel fee awards. The appellant filed no PFR from the initial decision denying fees. The Board relied on <span class="Italic">Schlachter v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 318, 320 (1984) (issuance of a court decision bearing on entitlement to counsel fees five months after the addendum decision did not furnish good cause for extending the time for a PFR by eight months), and <span class="Italic">Schafer v. DOD</span>, 6 MSPR 307, 309, 6 MSPB 262 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 135, 136-37 (1994), declined to reopen an appeal following subsequent decisions affecting back pay entitlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has petitioned for review of the initial decision issued on May 8, 1990, which dismissed his appeal as settled....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his position as Distribution Clerk effective February 24, 1990, based on attendance charges. During the pendency of his Board appeal, he entered into a settlement agreement with the agency, resolving the dispute between them. Finding that the settlement was lawful on its face, and freely entered into by the parties, the administrative judge accepted it into the record, and dismissed the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 3, 1993, the appellant requested that the Board "reopen" his appeal, alleging that the settlement's exclusion of backpay had been obtained through agency misinformation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the appellant filed a statement signed under penalty of perjury, again asserting that, in entering the settlement, he relied on incorrect information from the agency regarding his eligibility for backpay. Specifically, the appellant states that he was told by the agency that he was not entitled to backpay, even if he prevailed in his appeal, because he had not looked for employment. The appellant further states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During the processing of my latest appeal to the Board, I found two MSPB decision [sic] that stated Postal Service preference employees were entitled to backpay if the reasons for not seeking work was because of working on their appeal to the Board.... Had I been informed by the agency of this right I would not have waived backpay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant seeks to reopen his appeal over 3 1/2 years after the issuance of the initial decision. The appellant argues that he was unaware of the agency's alleged misrepresentation regarding backpay prior to the issuance of the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Andress v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 501 (1993), and <span class="Italic">Green v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 560 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, these decisions regarding the application of the agency's backpay regulations were not issued until years after the 1990 settlement negotiations. Accordingly, the agency committed no misrepresentation in relying upon them. Moreover, the fact that an employee did not know he had grounds to file a petition prior to issuance of a later Board decision does not establish good cause for waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Griffin v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 52 MSPR 178, 180 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Duft v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 533, 535 (1987), excused an otherwise late PFR that sought to take advantage of a retroactive change in the law concerning entitlement to counsel fees. The appellant had not filed a PFR under the law governing his case when his appeal became final. The later change in the law justified the delay in filing a PFR because "[t]he appellant reasonably understood that it would be fruitless and costly for him to appeal that ruling at that time."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Acree v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1994), the appellant accepted an initial decision without filing a PFR and later learned that other cases demonstrated that his demotion was actually an improperly constituted reduction in force. The Board declined to excuse the late PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, the appellant contends that he decided to "respect[ ]" the initial decision and not file a petition for review, but later changed his mind after reading in the Federal Times and in documents posted on an agency bulletin board that other employees who claimed to have been affected by the agency's 1992 RIF had prevailed before the Board. However, to the extent that the appellant claims that he was discouraged from filing a petition for review because he did not believe that he would be successful, the Board has held that such a reason does not constitute good cause....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, discovery of additional legal arguments or the issuance of a precedential decision after the time period for filing a petition for review has expired does not necessarily constitute good cause for wavier of the deadline for filing a petition for review.... The fact that others may have successfully advanced an argument that the appellant chose not to pursue does not establish good cause. <span class="Italic">Deem v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 468, 470 (1993); <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 5, 8 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board issued its decisions in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> in July 1993 and, thus, they were in existence at the time the appellant was pursuing his appeal below before the administrative judge. Our more recent decisions in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> and <span class="Italic">White</span>, although issued well after the time limit for filing a petition for review expired in this appeal, merely reaffirmed our prior holdings in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> that the agency's 1992 "restructuring" was actually a RIF. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> and <span class="Italic">White</span> do not represent a change in existing case law but a mere reaffirmation of case law that had existed for approximately 6 months prior to the issuance of the initial decision in this appeal. Accordingly, these decisions do not constitute new and material evidence warranting a waiver of the deadline for filing a petition for review....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board addressed the interrelation of a change in law and belated filing of a PFR based on that change in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 63 MSPR 631, 633-34 (1994), declining to excuse the belated PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states in his affidavit that he did not timely file a petition for review of the February 18, 1992 addendum initial decision because the clear precedent cited by the administrative judge, <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 451-53 (1991), precluded reimbursement for the appellant's out-of-pocket expenses. After the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> as to the recovery of out-of-pocket expenses in an IRA appeal in <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 175, 178-79 (1993), issued October 13, 1993, the appellant learned of the decision and filed this petition for review on December 27, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that these circumstances do not show good cause for the delay. The appellant decided to forego his opportunity to request the Board to reverse the administrative judge's determination regarding the availability of an award of attorney fees for the appellant's out-of-pocket expenses in his IRA appeal. The issuance of a new precedent after the expiration of the time period for filing a petition for review does not establish good cause for waiver of the time limit<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Deem v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 468, 470 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, we decline to reopen this appeal on our own motion, as the appellant requests. While "clear and material error" based on a change in the controlling law is accepted as a standard for granting reopening, such authority must be exercised within a reasonable period of time. <span class="Italic">See Moriarty v. Rhode Island Air National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard</span>, 56 MSPR 144, 148 (1992). The determination of a reasonable time varies with the circumstances of each case, but the Board has held that the time is generally measured in weeks rather than years. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 148-50; <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 46 MSPR 341, 349 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 949 F.2d 404 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). In this proceeding, the appellant requests reopening more than 21 months after the addendum initial decision became final. We find that the time elapsed exceeds a reasonable period and that no unusual circumstances exist necessitating that we reopen and reconsider the addendum initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Deem</span>, 58 MSPR at 470; <span class="Italic">Moriarty</span>, 56 MSPR at 148.</p>
