<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-154"><span class="space">A.</span> PRESUMPTION OF HONESTY AND IMPARTIALITY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of an Article III judge, the late Chief Judge Howard Markey of the Federal Circuit observed that "[o]f all the charges that might be leveled against one sworn to 'administer justice' and to 'faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me,' 28 USC 453, a charge of bias <span id="Page_1430"></span>must be deemed at or near the very top in seriousness, for bias kills the very soul of judging--fairness." <span class="Italic">Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace Corp.</span>, 903 F.2d 796, 802 (Fed. Cir. 1990). "Given the fundamental and overriding requirement that the Board render impartial decisions, even the appearance of partiality can undermine the respect for the Board's adjudicatory process." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 454, 459 &#x00B6; 10 (2000). An allegation of bias is a serious matter challenging the integrity of the AJ and going to the core of the judicial function. Bias charges are not taken lightly; they should not be casually presented. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 118, 120 (1982). Justice Scalia's analysis of a recusal motion makes interesting reading, even if it does not address MSPB recusal standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia</span>, 124 S. Ct. 1391 (2004). "An administrative judge's conduct during the course of a Board proceeding warrants a new adjudication only if the administrative judge's comments or actions evidence 'a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.' <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Department of the Army,</span> 287 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2002)." <span class="Italic">Simpkins v. OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 411, 413 &#x00B6; 5, 2010 MSPB 52 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expressed the fundamental test for bias allegations, <span class="Italic">Hayden v. USPS</span>, <span class="blue">15 MSPR 296</span>, 300 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is certainly violative of due process to allow an individual's basic rights to be determined by a biased decisionmaker or by a decisionmaker in a situation structured in such a manner that "the risk of unfairness is intolerably high," <span class="Italic">see Withrow v. Larkin,</span> 421 U.S. 35, 58, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 1470, 43 L. Ed.2d 712 (1975), the burden is on the appellant to establish actual bias or an intolerable risk of unfairness. <span class="Italic">See Svejda v. Department of the Interior,</span> 7 MSPB 36, 37 (1981). Furthermore, in making a claim of bias or prejudice, an appellant must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity on the part of the presiding official. <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Department of Transportation,</span> 1 MSPB 368, 370 (1980). Appellant does not cite to any evidence which would support a finding of bias on the part of the presiding official or show that the agency documents predisposed him to rule in favor of the agency. That the presiding official ultimately ruled in favor of the agency is insufficient evidence of bias. <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Department of the Navy,</span> 2 MSPB 297, 300 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we find that the Board regulations cited by the appellant create an intolerable risk of unfairness. Rather, these Board regulations promote fairness to the appellant because they guarantee to him an opportunity to challenge the evidence, including written statements upon which the agency relied in making its decision, as well as assuring him that the Board decision will be based solely on evidence which he has had an opportunity to rebut. The Board regulations do not preclude the Board from giving little or no weight to such evidence in determining whether or not the agency has met its burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit does not favor accusations of bias against AJs. To prevail on a claim of bias against a AJ, the appellant must show almost irrefragable proof of bias. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gates v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 83-854); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-937). Recognizing the problem of unfounded bias allegations, the Federal Circuit imposed a $500 fine against an attorney in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 769 F.2d 1556, 1557-58 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without the slightest justification, counsel asserts that the Presiding Official: was biased against all petitioners; permitted the government to employ criminal conduct, the remotest hearsay, phony and withheld documents; failed to call witnesses with actual knowledge; protected and defended the government; and disregarded the rules of evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel's utterly meritless raillery against the Presiding Official is offensive.

Moreover, even if this court stretched to accept Bailey's assertions at face value, those assertions still would not likely meet the lofty showings necessary to prove prejudice. The Supreme Court has suggested the nature of that showing in the context of Article III judges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]pinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible. Thus, judicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of, or even hostile to, counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge....&#8197;Not establishing bias or partiality...are expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger, that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women, even after having been confirmed as federal judges, sometimes display. A judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration--even a stern and short-tempered judge's ordinary efforts at courtroom administration--remain immune.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Bias charges are too common in Board cases. In an attempt to dissuade advocates from unwarranted charges against AJs, we review here in some detail decisions concerning allegations of bias. We refer readers to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges. Although a Board attorney-examiner serving as an AJ does not come within the Code's definition of a United States Judge, the Code provides useful guidelines to measure the personal and professional conduct of the Board's corps of administrative judges: <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges">https://www.uscourts.gov/judges-judgeships/code-conduct-united-states-judges</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs should run a hearing with fairness, impartiality, courtesy, and patience. They also ought to avoid delay in their adjudications. To avoid criticism, AJs should not address participants in familiar terms or show emotion during the hearing. The Board accords itself and its employees a presumption that they are persons of "conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 279 (1988), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Morgan</span>, 313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941). Nonetheless, there will be times when a AJ must withdraw from a case or when a party believes that the AJ should withdraw from the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although no reported Board cases conclude that an AJ was biased, there are a few cases finding improper conduct by of an adjudication by an AJ. <span class="Italic">Singleton v. USDA</span>, 39 MSPR 232, 235 (1988), determined that an appearance of impropriety warranted a new adjudication by a new AJ. The AJ initially assigned to the case urged the parties to settle, allegedly suggesting to the appellant's attorney that the deciding official was a high-level Republican official and commenting: "What do you think the Chairman of the MSPB is and what do you think the Board will do with this case when it reviews it?" <span class="Italic">Grubka v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 858 F.2d 1570, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1988), imputed bias for what the court considered arbitrary factual findings of the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...While it is true that ordinarily the question of credibility is left to the AJ, this is not an inflexible rule and will not be enforced if the credibility determination is inherently improbable or discredited by undisputed fact. We think that is the situation here. In his decision, the AJ stated, in referring to the actions of Grubka: "After going too far, he was caught." There is no basis for this statement. It shows undeniable bias on the part of the AJ against Grubka, and makes the AJ partisan against Grubka when he should have been neutral and nonpartisan. This statement tainted his decision on credibility in this charge, as well as in all of the other charges in this case. We hold that the finding by the AJ that the testimony of Novak was credible and that of Grubka was incredible was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and unsupported by substantial evidence and is set aside. 5 USC 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What accounts for the number of cases reporting bias allegations? The reasons are several. Many appellants represent themselves and look to the Board to save their jobs. This is not the Board's function. Given the statistical rate of Board affirmation of agency adverse actions, in part the result of deference by the Board to agency penalty determinations reasonably determined, there is an apparent institutional (as opposed to individual) bias in favor of affirmation of agency decisions when comparison is drawn to results on disciplinary cases reached by labor arbitrators. The appellant who is disappointed by the AJ's handling of the case may allege bias because he does not understand the system well enough to recognize that the AJ is doing his job. Attorneys may lodge bias allegations for two reasons. Probably the most common situation is the attorney who is making his first appearance before the Board. To him, Board procedures appear designed to limit the opportunity to make a case. Compared with the practice of the appointed or elected judges in our federal and state courts, MSPB AJs are more likely to refuse to hear witnesses and more likely to exclude evidence. Then there are AJs who cannot do their job; their poor performance is confused with bias. They should not be AJs because they lack the proper training or temperament. They will be challenged for bias if that is the only way either to gain their attention or to have them taken off the appeal. Finally, AJs who know their work bring bias allegations upon themselves. Some AJs seem incapable of wit or human emotion; others do everything possible to isolate themselves from the participants in an appeal. Some AJs who have a reasonable rate of reversal of agency actions are challenged for bias because they appear curt, they exclude evidence or witnesses that may not be essential but would not unduly prolong the hearing, and they appear to lack tact or consideration for the parties. Some AJs who sustain agencies most often are never challenged, probably because they are cordial to the parties and allow development of a complete hearing record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1431"></span>Whether an adjudicator's impartiality might reasonably be questioned turns on an objective evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case, as viewed by a reasonable person.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the legal framework for reviewing motions for disqualification is rather limited.

There must be a substantial showing of personal bias to disqualify a hearing officer. Past rulings against the party could not be the basis for a claim of personal bias. Nor was an effort by the hearing official to accommodate a reasonable request of an agency representative bias when the appellant was fully informed of the procedural development. A broad allegation of racial discrimination was not a sufficient basis to disqualify the adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the appeal did not involve an AJ, discussion in <span class="Italic">Chocallo v. SSA, DHEW</span>, 1 MSPR 605, 610-11, 2 MSPB 23 (1980) (ALJ Decision), involving removal of a SSA ALJ, includes considerable commentary on the conduct that can subject an adjudicator to a well-founded allegation of bias and inappropriate behavior during the conduct of a case. Examples in the discussion include refusal to permit a party's counsel a reasonable opportunity to question witnesses, questioning of a client by the adjudicator concerning matters protected by the attorney-client privilege, disparagement of counsel during the hearing and in a written opinion, and curt, impatient, and domineering behavior by a judge toward counsel. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Matosian v.
