<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-107"><span class="space">7.</span> Information Pertaining to Aggravation or Mitigation of Penalty; <span class="Italic">Ward</span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> a distinction was drawn between information relied on in proposing an action and the information that the deciding official used to determine the penalty. A deciding official could, like a sentencing judge in reaching penalty determinations, rely on information not in the proposal notice, including information raised by the employee in his own defense. <span class="Italic">Schwender v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 19 MSPR 522, 629 (1984). If an agency relied upon information not disclosed to the appellant, the issue became one of mitigation of the penalty rather than harmful error if the information would have tended to mitigate rather than completely avoid the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Vanover v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 21 MSPR 296, 299 (1984). The Board reached this result by relying on <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984), determining that although the failure of the agency to notify the appellant of the right to union representation was to be evaluated under the harmful error standard, the case would be remanded for a determination of the reasonableness of the penalty imposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the post-<span class="Italic">Stone</span> decision of <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 256, 262-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2000), the proposal letter was based in part on AWOL charges. The decision letter sustained the proposal and noted that there was additional AWOL following the issuance of the proposal. The AJ concluded that the additional information constituted an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication to the deciding official that invalidated the adverse action. The Board disagreed: <span class="Italic">Stone</span> did not mandate reversal of the action, although the penalty was to be reconsidered upon remand:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the AJ that the evidence supports a finding that the deciding official learned of the appellant's postremoval AWOL through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with either the proposing official or other agency officials....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3264"></span>Nevertheless, we must heed the court's admonition in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> that "not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication...undermines the due process guarantee.... Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce <span class="Italic">new and material information</span> to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice." 179 F.3d at 1377 (emphasis added). The Board considers evidence to be material to a proceeding only where it is of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Camenisch-Felts v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 47 MSPR 493, 496-97 (1991); <span class="Italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 MSPB 427, 3 MSPR 345, 349 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the court instructed us that the ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. 179 F.3d at 1377. Here, as the agency points out in its petition for review, the appellant admitted during the Board proceedings that he committed the acts or omissions that were the basis for all six of the charges, and he also admitted both that he had been disciplined for being AWOL previously and that he had been under leave restrictions when he committed the leave-related offenses that were the subject of four of the six charges. In addition, the appellant has admitted that he was AWOL for 72 hours after issuance of the proposal letter, as referenced by the deciding official in the decision letter, and he has never denied that he was AWOL from November 2, 1998 until the decision letter was issued. Thus, there is no reason to conclude that the appellant would have denied the postproposal AWOL allegations had he been informed of them below, nor is there any reason to believe that the deciding official would not have sustained the charges even in the absence of his knowledge of the appellant's post-proposal conduct. Under these circumstances, we agree with the agency and find that the information the deciding official obtained through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications was not so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances, and therefore we find that it was not material and that the agency did not commit a due process violation.[5]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The removal proceedings in this case present serious due process concerns and a violation of Agency procedure, both of which the Board erred in addressing. Ward's Notice of Proposed Removal proposed his removal from the Agency based solely on his conduct during the August 19, 2008 Incident. The Deciding Official, however, proceeded to have <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with three supervisors and one manager from the Agency during which he learned of several alleged past instances of misconduct by Ward. Although these prior incidents were not referenced in Ward's Notice of Proposed Removal, leaving Ward entirely unaware that such incidents would be considered as grounds for his removal, the Deciding Official later admitted, in his testimony before the administrative judge, that these incidents had influenced his decision that removal was warranted. Specifically, the Deciding Official testified that Ward's "recurring pattern" of misconduct impacted his analysis of at least two <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, as it gave the Deciding Official little confidence in Ward's ability to satisfactorily perform his duties and convinced the Deciding Official that Ward showed no potential for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At worst, the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated Ward's due process rights, automatically entitling him to a new removal proceeding free from any violation of his constitutional rights. The Board, however, erred in failing to analyze the due process issues presented in this case. At a minimum, the Deciding Official's consideration of alleged past misconduct that was not included in the Notice of Proposed Removal violated Agency procedure, requiring a harmless error analysis. The Board properly recognized this procedural error. Yet the Board erred in concluding that it could "remedy the error" by performing its own penalty analysis in which it considered whether, in its view, the removal penalty was "within the tolerable limits of reasonableness." We address the due process issues and the procedural error in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board erred in failing to address the due process concerns arising out of the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications regarding Ward's alleged prior instances of misconduct, which were not mentioned in Ward's Notice of Proposed Removal or otherwise referenced in the proceeding until the Deciding Official testified before the administrative judge that these incidents played a role in his penalty determination. Where a public employee has a property interest in continued employment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires that the employee be afforded notice "both of the charges and of the employer's evidence" and an "opportunity to respond" before being removed from employment. <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC,</span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-76 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In<span class="Italic"> Stone v. FDIC,</span> we established a standard for determining whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with a deciding official in the course of a public employee's removal proceeding violate the employee's due process rights. We recognized that "not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and likely to cause prejudice that it undermines...due process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376-77. Instead, "only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official" violate due process. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1377. We emphasized that the ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Blank,</span> 247 F.3d at 1229; <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the seriousness of a due process violation, we made clear that if the deciding official received "new and material information" by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, thereby violating the employee's due process rights, the "violation is not subject to the harmless error test." <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 137 F.3d at 1377. Instead, the employee is automatically entitled to an "entirely new" and "constitutionally correct" removal proceeding.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board did not analyze the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications under the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> framework to determine whether Ward's due process rights were violated. Rather, the Board held that "[w]here an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication does not relate to the charge itself, but relates instead to the penalty, the Board has not considered such error to be [a] denial of due process of law to be analyzed under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone.</span>" <span class="Italic">See Biniak v. Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 682, 686-87 (2002). We reject as arbitrary and unsupportable the Board's distinction between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications relating to the charge itself and <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications relating to the penalty. Indeed, if <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influence a deciding official's penalty determination, contributing to the enhancement of the penalty to removal, the communications impact the employee's property interest in continued employment no less than if they relate to the underlying charge. Moreover, the distinction has no support in our case law. <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> referencing Supreme Court precedent, emphasized the importance of giving an employee notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty as well as a meaningful opportunity to address "whether the level of penalty to be imposed is appropriate." 179 F.3d at 1376. In our view, <span class="Italic">Stone</span> thus makes clear that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing information material to the penalty run astray of the due process requirements of notice and an opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communications that introduce "new and material information," whether material to the merits of the underlying charge or material to the penalty to be imposed, violate due process. There is no constitutionally relevant distinction between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications relating to the underlying charge and those relating to the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we remand this case to the Board to analyze, in the first instance, whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the Deciding Official and various Agency supervisors and managers undermined Ward's procedural due process rights under <span class="Italic">Stone.</span> "Specifically, the Board must analyze whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in this case introduced new and material information to the [D]eciding [O]fficial."[2] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the Board finds that the communications did introduce new and material information in violation of Ward's due process rights, Ward must be afforded a "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board may not excuse the constitutional violation as harmless error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1372-77 (remanding to the Board for determination of whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated the employee's due process rights despite deciding official's affidavit stating that "he would have concluded that [the employee] should be removed whether or not he had [received the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the administrative judge found that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications at issue in this case did not violate Ward's due process rights because they were not "of the type that resulted in undue pressure upon [the Deciding Official] to rule in a particular manner." In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, we held that "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner" is a relevant factor in determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated due process. <span class="Italic">Blank</span>, 247 F.3d at 1229; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. This, however, is only one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Blank</span>, 247 F.3d at 1229; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The administrative judge's finding on this point is therefore not a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not violate Ward's due process rights. Further, the court notes that if the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications "were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official," this may well make it more likely that the employee was deprived of due process. Yet the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where, as here, the Deciding Official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination. Under these circumstances, the materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications appears to be self-evident from the Deciding Official's admission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the Board, on remand, concludes that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not rise to the level of a due process violation, the Agency's consideration of Ward's alleged past instances of misconduct, without referencing these incidents in the Notice of Proposed Removal, was still a procedural error. As <span class="Italic">Stone</span> recognized, "the Due Process Clause only provides the minimum process to which a public employee is entitled prior to removal." 179 F.3d at 1377-78. "Public employees are, of course, entitled to...other procedural protections...afforded them by statute, regulation, or agency procedure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1378. Section 752.404(f) of 5 C.F.R., the regulation governing Agency procedure for removal of qualified employees, including Ward, provides that "[i]n arriving at its decision, the agency shall not consider any reasons for action other than those specified in the notice of proposed action." <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 331 &#x0026; n.65; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(c). As such, it is a procedural error, in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f), for "an agency to rely on matters affecting the penalty it imposes without including those matters in the proposal notice." <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 574, 579 (2005); <span class="Italic">see Turner v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 565, 569 (2000); <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 625, 628 (1999); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f). Thus, the Board in this case properly found that the Deciding Official erred in considering Ward's alleged prior incidents of misconduct, which were not included in the Notice of Proposed Removal, as grounds for imposing the penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite recognizing this procedural error, the Board erred in concluding that it could "remedy the error" by performing an independent analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine whether "removal is within the bounds of reasonableness."<span class="Italic"></span> Instead, the Board was required to run a harmless error analysis to determine whether the procedural error required reversal. The Civil Service Reform Act provides that the Board may not sustain an agency decision if the employee "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Diaz v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 63 F.3d 1107, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Shaw v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 697 F.2d 1078, 1080 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1)]. The Board's regulations define "harmful error" as an "[e]rror by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 697 F.2d at 1080. We have repeatedly held employees to this burden to show harmful error in an agency's procedure in order to establish reversible procedural error. <span class="Italic">Diaz,</span> 63 F.3d at 1109 ("We have previously held that an employee challenging an agency action has the burden to prove that a violation of a statutory procedure was harmful."); <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("It is insufficient simply to show that a statutory procedure was not followed at the agency level. Harmful error must be shown."); <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 697 F.2d at 1080-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Arguably, the Board's independent analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine whether "removal is within the bounds of reasonableness" was the Board's attempt to perform a harmless error analysis. The focus of a harmless error analysis, however, is the <span class="Italic">agency</span> and whether the <span class="Italic">agency</span> is likely to have reached a different conclusion in the absence of the procedural error. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">see Diaz,</span> 63 F.3d at 1109 ("[Petitioner] did not argue or submit any evidence that showed that the agency's procedural violation affected the outcome of the agency's decision or was in any way harmful. Therefore, the Board properly declined to reverse the agency's decision to remove [Petitioner]."); <span class="Italic">Handy,</span> 754 F.2d at 338 ("Having failed to show that in some way [that the absence of the procedural error] would have possibly affected the agency's decision, petitioner is not entitled to prevail."); <span class="Italic">Shaw,</span> 697 F.2d at 1080-81. In contrast, the Board's "own analysis" of Ward's penalty considered whether, in its view, the imposed penalty did "not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness." Thus, the Board's independent analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors did not constitute a proper harmless error analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, on remand, if the Board determines that the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not violate Ward's due process rights, the Board must consider whether the Agency's procedural error, in considering Ward's alleged prior instances of misconduct without including these incidents in the Notice of Proposed Removal, constituted harmful error. Specifically, here as in other cases, the Board must analyze whether "there is some indication that the agency would have regarded the sustained charges as insufficient to justify the penalty imposed." <span class="Italic">Chambers,</span> 602 F.3d at 1381 (internal quotation omitted). If there is such an indication, the matter must be remanded "to the agency for redetermination of the appropriate penalty in the first instance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above analysis, we vacate the Board's decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the Board must first analyze whether the Deciding Official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated Ward's due process rights by introducing new and material information. If the Board finds that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did introduce new and material information, Ward must be afforded a new removal proceeding free from such violations of his constitutional rights. If, however, the Board finds that Ward's due process rights were not violated because the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not introduce new and material information, the Board must analyze whether the Agency's procedural error, considering Ward's alleged prior misconduct that was not included in his Notice of Proposed Removal, was harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, in turn, sent the case back to the AJ, <span class="Italic">Ward v. USPS,</span> PH-0752-09-0126-M-1 (NP 5/13/2011), distinguishing constitutional due process violations and harmful errors affecting reply rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the due process issue, "the ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is 'so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances.'" <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1279 (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999)). Factors that may be relevant in resolving the issue include (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information, (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it, and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d <span id="Page_3266"></span>at 1377. After affording the parties the opportunity to submit evidence and argument on the due process issue, the administrative judge shall adjudicate the issue consistent with Board and Federal Circuit precedent. <span class="Italic">E.g., Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1279-80 &#x0026; n.2; <span class="Italic">Blank v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge finds that the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications violated the appellant's due process rights, the appellant's removal cannot be sustained and that will be the end of the inquiry. <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1279, 1282-83. If, however, the administrative judge finds that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not rise to the level of a due process violation, she shall proceed to the second issue that the court identified for adjudication, i.e., whether the agency committed harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281-83.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the harmful procedural error issue, the record shows that the agency violated the procedures of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f) (2008) by considering matters not specified in the notice of proposed removal in arriving at its decision. <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1281. However, the mere fact that the agency violated this regulatory provision does not necessarily mean that the removal cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Diaz v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 63 F.3d 1107, 1109 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Agbaniyaka v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 11 (2010).

After affording the parties the opportunity to submit evidence and argument on the harmful error issue, the administrative judge shall, if necessary, adjudicate the issue consistent with the court's remand instructions. <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1281-83.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Ward</span> decision required a remand for analysis of the effect of potentially <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information concerning the penalty to the deciding official in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 453, 458-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13, 2011 MSPB 62 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that because none of the specifications in the notice of proposed action involved women other than K.M., he was harmed when the agency's deciding official saw statements from two other women that alleged that he had engaged in similar conduct towards them. The appellant asserts that the deciding official testified that these statements "weighted [sic] heavily in his decision" to remove the appellant. While we cannot find such a statement in the transcript, the deciding official did testify that he had seen statements regarding the other women that caused him to believe that the appellant's conduct was intentional, and he admitted that one such statement did "factor" into his decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge applied the harmful error test and held that, although the deciding official reviewed the statements from the other alleged victims, because the deciding official "testified that he based his decision on the charge and specifications contained in the notice of proposed removal," the penalty was sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the issuance of the initial decision, the Federal Circuit issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d 1274. Prior to the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Board had held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication does not relate to the charge itself, but relates instead to the penalty, the Board has not considered such error to be denial of due process of law to be analyzed under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone [v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999)]; rather, the Board will remedy the error by doing its own analysis of the penalty factors. The agency's error, therefore, does not necessarily require mitigation of the penalty; the question is whether removal is within the bounds of reasonableness, considering the pertinent factors other than [those contained in the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication].</p>

In its <span class="Italic">Ward</span> decision, the Federal Circuit expressly overruled this approach and held that if the employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty," an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.

Under the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> test,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. In deciding whether new and material information has been introduced by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts, the Board should...[consider]: whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. Ultimately, the inquiry of the Board is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The application of the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor--whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner--cannot be determined from the written record.[5] The deciding official testified that the statements of the other women were a factor in his decision but also that he would have removed the appellant even if he had not seen the statements by the other women. The deciding official's two statements appear to conflict, and the administrative judge did not conduct a detailed <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> analysis enabling us to determine whether the deciding official's knowledge of the other alleged victims created "undue pressure" on the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Hillen</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 458. As the hearing official, the administrative judge is in the best position to resolve this question. <span class="Italic">See Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1299-1300.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, in accordance with the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the administrative judge must apply the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors to the issue of the deciding official's receipt of the statements by the other alleged victims. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kilpatrick v. VA</span>, CB-7121-13-0181-V-1 (NP 5/8/2014), reiterated the <span class="Italic">Ward</span> materiality test:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is undisputed based on her testimony and written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors that the deciding official considered the prior incident, there is no evidence that the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official to remove the appellant. However, an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is material when it influences the deciding official's penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Seeler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). The third factor in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> test is "less relevant" when the deciding official states that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication "influenced her determination." <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2013). The deciding official's consistent statements in her testimony and in her written statement on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are clear evidence of the materiality of the appellant's prior incident in the deciding official's decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reference in <span class="Italic">Kilpatrick</span> to <span class="Italic">Young v. DHUD</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2013), was to a passage in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, we identified several useful factors to consider when determining if new and material information has been introduced by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication <span id="Page_3267"></span>introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the communication and had a chance to respond; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication resulted in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Where "the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances," a due process violation has occurred and the former employee is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such a violation is not subject to the harmless error test. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, HUD argues that the deciding official uncovered cumulative, rather than "new and material," information during her investigatory interviews of Mr. Darr, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Haggins, and Mr. Davis. HUD maintains that <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2001), authorizes such interviews to "confirm and clarify information that was already contained in the record." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1229.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are convinced that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in this case were more than "confirming and clarifying information" that was already on the record because the deciding official described the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication as a "huge" departure from written statements already on the record. The deciding official also admitted that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were the most critical statements in her mind. The significant and overwhelming role that the new communication played in the termination decision makes it evident that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introduced new and material information as understood under the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we observed in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>--a case very similar to this one--the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, undue pressure, is less relevant to determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where, as here, the deciding official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced her determination. 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Based on record admissions regarding the significance of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor strongly suggests a due process violation while any deficiency of the third factor is less significant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reference to <span class="Italic">Ward v. USPS</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011), was to footnote 2 of that decision, stating, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the court notes that if the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications "were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official," this may well make it more likely that the employee was deprived of due process. Yet the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where, as here, the Deciding Official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination. Under these circumstances, the materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications appears to be self-evident from the Deciding Official's admission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of significance in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> is the ability of the agency to again initiate adverse action for the same reasons but through a constitutionally sufficient process. That point was emphasized in <span class="Italic">Sill v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-0752-11-0564-I-1 (NP 6/19/2012), when the agency's removal action was set aside under <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and the agency then removed the appellant while its PFR from the first (unsuccessful) removal effort was pending with the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, we note the appellant's January 4, 2010 challenge of the agency's certification of compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). With his challenge, the appellant includes an SF-50 indicating that the agency removed him on the same charges as in this matter, effective December 13, 2011, prior to a final decision on the agency's petition for review. Because the document is dated after the October 29, 2011 close of the record on review, we may consider it, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(i), but it does not show that the agency failed to comply with the administrative judge's interim relief order. The agency indicates in its certification of compliance with that order that it initially placed the appellant in a paid, non-duty status effective the date of the initial decision, August 30, 2011, and that it subsequently returned him to duty, pending adjudication of its petition for review, on October 17, 2011. Under these circumstances, the agency is fully within its rights to subsequently remove the appellant under a "new, constitutionally correct removal proceeding." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Moreover, we note that the appellant has filed a separate appeal of the December 2011 removal action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, an Internal Review Auditor with the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, was indicted by the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas grand jury on multiple counts of conspiracy, corrupt activity, theft, money laundering, and receipt of stolen property.[2] He pled guilty to two felony counts of receiving stolen property, and subsequently was convicted of these charges. The agency proposed to remove the appellant based upon his felony criminal conviction. Deciding Official Stephen Borushko issued a decision notice sustaining the charge and finding that a nexus exists between the appellant's off-duty criminal misconduct and his ability to perform his duties, and that the penalty of removal was appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant's indictment arose from his alleged participation in a mortgage fraud scheme.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed a Board appeal of the removal action, alleging discrimination based on race and sex, and retaliation for engaging in equal employment opportunity activity. Among other things, he argued that Deciding Official Borushko considered information concerning his eligibility, as a convicted felon, to maintain his non-critical sensitive position without providing advance notice of this matter, and that such consideration violated the appellant's due process rights. The appellant further argued, in the alternative, that, by Deciding Official Borushko's actions, the agency committed harmful procedural error that substantially prejudiced his rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's removal must be reversed because the agency violated the appellant's constitutional right to due process as explained in the Federal Circuit's recent Ward decision.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its recent decision in <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011), issued after the initial decision in this case, our reviewing court held that an appellant's constitutional due process rights may be violated if a deciding official considered new and material information when deciding whether to impose an enhanced penalty. In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Federal Circuit held that if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty[,] " an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. In determining whether to find a due process violation, the Board must consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the claimant to an entirely new administrative proceeding; rather, only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77. The introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice and the opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. When deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the inquiry of the Board is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Our reviewing court made clear that if the deciding official received new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, thereby violating an employee's due process rights, the violation is not subject to the harmless error test; instead, the employee is automatically entitled to an "entirely new" and "constitutionally correct" removal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">see Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The Board may not excuse the constitutional violation as harmless error. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant disagrees with the administrative judge's finding that the agency fulfilled its due process requirements with respect to "the deciding official's actions in questioning whether the appellant could occupy a non-critical sensitive position." It is unclear whether the administrative judge specifically found that Deciding Official Borushko considered information about the appellant's eligibility to maintain his sensitive position in imposing the penalty of removal. Based upon our review of the record, however, we find that the deciding official did consider this information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, upon receiving the appellant's response to the proposal notice, Deciding Official Borushko e-mailed Joe Oshinski, Personnel Security Specialist, asking whether the appellant, a convicted felon, would be able to maintain his sensitive position. On April 6, <span id="Page_3268"></span>2010, Mr. Oshinski provided the deciding official with a summary of the applicable Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, and informed him that the appellant's convictions would raise serious security concerns that most likely would be disqualifying, i.e., lead to revocation of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, but that the revocation decision would be made by the Washington Headquarters Service, Central Adjudication Facility. During the hearing and in his answers to the appellant's interrogatories, the deciding official admitted that he considered this information in deciding to remove the appellant and unintentionally omitted discussion of the matter from the decision notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the written record contains an April 7, 2010 e-mail that the deciding official sent to Employee Relations Specialist Katherine Murray, stating his decision to remove the appellant because of the appellant's guilty plea "would raise serious security concerns that would most likely lead to a revocation of his eligibility to occupy a sensitive position" and citing the applicable provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines; it was understood that Ms. Murray would "flesh [out the e-mail notes] into a decision notice for [his] review and approval." Based on the weight of the evidence, we find that the deciding official considered information concerning the appellant's eligibility to maintain a sensitive position as a factor in imposing an enhanced penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the information considered by the deciding official constitutes new rather than cumulative information. The agency does not contend, and the record evidence does not reflect, that the appellant was aware of this matter. Nor did the agency include this information in the proposal notice and thus, it cannot be considered cumulative. Although there is no evidence that the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official to remove the appellant, our reviewing court emphasized in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> that whether the additional information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official is only one of the several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. "[T]he lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding [o]fficial admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination," making the "materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications...self-evident from the [d]eciding [o]fficial's admission." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consequently, while there is no clear evidence of undue pressure, the materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications is self-evident from the deciding official's admission that he considered the appellant's eligibility to maintain a sensitive position in deciding to remove him. Thus, the deciding official improperly considered new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the deciding official's consideration of such aggravating factors without the appellant's knowledge was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Consequently, because the agency violated the appellant's due process guarantee to notice, the agency's error cannot be excused as harmless, and the appellant's removal must be cancelled. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. The agency may not remove the appellant unless and until he is afforded a new "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The issue is not what the appellant knows but what the deciding official considered that was not referenced in the proposal, as <span class="Italic">Gordon v. NASA</span>, DA-0752-13-0032-I-1 (NP 2/19/2014), concluded concerning information obtained from a threat assessment team:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the fact that the underlying information is known to the appellant does not determine whether it is cumulative. <span class="Italic">See Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13 (2011) (holding that it was improper for the deciding official to consider a prior three-day suspension and other alleged past instances of misconduct because the agency failed to advise the appellant of these factors in the proposal notice). When an appellant is not aware that information was considered as an aggravating factor in determining penalty and the agency did not include the information in its proposal notice, then the information cannot be considered cumulative. <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 11. Here the record does not reflect that the appellant was aware that the TAT information would be considered by the deciding official. Further, the proposal notice contained no reference to the TAT information. We find the information to be new and not cumulative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paulic v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-0752-14-0606-I-1 (NP 2/6/2015) (weapons violation removal was set aside for lack of due process based on considerations, unknown to the appellant, of an "Insider Threat Mitigation Team" and comparator information).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, Fischer stated in his decision letter that the appellant lacked rehabilitative potential, at least in part, because he "had problems in the past with others." As the administrative judge noted, no such "problems" were included in the agency's notice of proposed removal or were specifically referenced or identified elsewhere in the record. The administrative judge remedied the agency's error by conducting an independent analysis of the penalty before concluding that removal was reasonable even without consideration of this factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge's approach was consistent with the Board's case law as it then existed, it is no longer correct in light of <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Consistent with <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Board has recently held that, when a deciding official considers aggravating factors that were not included in the proposal notice, whether that consideration results from improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with another or from the deciding official's personal knowledge and experience with the appellant, the appellant is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a possible violation of his right to due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 10 (2011); <span class="Italic">Gray v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Not every instance in which the deciding official considers new aggravating factors is sufficiently significant to constitute a violation of due process. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone v.

The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether the consideration of new aggravating factors violated the appellant's right to minimum due process: (1) Whether the information is new information or merely cumulative; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 7;<span class="Italic"> Thomas</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 11.

Instead, the due process violation can only be remedied through a new "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 7;<span class="Italic"> Thomas</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 13.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the deciding official clearly relied on an aggravating factor in imposing the removal penalty that was not cited in the notice of proposed removal. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, consideration of an aggravating factor that was not set out in the proposal notice requires the Board to determine whether the agency violated the appellant's right to minimum due process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279-80.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Warren v. USPS</span>, No. 2012-3147 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), determined there was no due process error or harmful error when the agency proposal notice stated that Warren's prior disciplinary history would be considered and he was given opportunity to respond:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Warren was employed as a Rural Carrier with the United States Postal Service ("USPS") and was removed in 2009 for unsatisfactory work performance. Warren appealed his removal to the Board, alleging that it was the product of age and race discrimination, as well as retaliation for filing a grievance. In August 2010, the administrative judge ("AJ") issued an initial decision affirming the removal action. The AJ concluded that USPS had proven Warren's unsatisfactory work performance by a preponderance of the evidence, finding he had violated an important safety policy about which he had received specific and extensive training. However, the AJ also found that the agency's deciding official, Postmaster Kevin Claus ("Claus"), erred by relying upon Warren's "poor performance, inability to get along with [others], and 'bad attitude'" as aggravating factors, because these factors were not articulated in the USPS's proposed removal notice. The AJ then conducted a new analysis of the reasonableness of the penalty in light of the factors delineated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), disregarding any consideration of Warren's general performance, <span id="Page_3269"></span>attitude, or interpersonal relations, and nevertheless concluded that removal was warranted. The AJ also concluded that Warren failed to prove his removal was the product of age discrimination, that there was no evidence supporting a finding that race was a factor, and that there was no merit to his retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Warren petitioned for reconsideration by the full Board, contesting for the first time the merits of his prior disciplinary actions that supported the removal decision. The Board affirmed the AJ's findings, found no clear error in the USPS's or the AJ's consideration of the prior disciplinary actions, and agreed that Warren failed to establish a claim of disparate penalty. The Board <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> addressed the AJ's finding that Claus improperly relied upon the fourth <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor and held that, although the AJ's assessment was consistent with the Board's case law at the time of the initial decision, that law was no longer correct in light of our decision in <span class="Italic">Ward v. United States Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (holding that appellant's right to due process may be violated if deciding official considers new and material information when determining whether to impose enhanced penalty). Accordingly, the Board remanded the August 2010 decision with instructions to consider whether Claus's consideration of aggravating factors violated Warren's due process rights, and, if those rights were not violated, whether USPS committed harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand and further hearing, the AJ reaffirmed the removal decision, concluding that USPS did not err with respect to its penalty determination. The AJ found that, even if the proposal notice was somehow defective because it did not specifically state that USPS was considering the substance of misconduct listed in prior disciplinary letters, such defect did not deprive Warren of due process. In particular, the AJ found the information was cumulative because Warren was specifically notified that his prior disciplinary history would be considered and was given opportunity to respond. Similarly, the AJ concluded that, even if Warren could demonstrate a procedural defect, such error was harmless because Claus credibly testified that he would have taken the same action regardless of considering the fourth <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor. ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also correctly held that there was no violation of Warren's right to due process. We have set forth three factors relevant to whether a due process violation has occurred because of consideration of information not included in the notice of proposed removal: 1) whether the information is new or merely cumulative; 2) whether the employee knew of the error and had an opportunity to respond; and 3) whether information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Warren has provided no basis for overturning the Board's conclusion that, contrary to its initial findings, the deciding official, Claus, "did not consider any 'information or documentation' that was outside of the proposal and materials supporting the proposal notice." Based on the record before us, we agree with the Board's determination that the AJ did not err in finding that the information regarding Warren's work record was only cumulative of the information contained in the letters recording three separate disciplinary actions prior to his removal, that Warren had notice of this information, and that there was no evidence that the information resulted in undue pressure on Claus to decide in a certain way.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also correctly held that there was no harmful procedural error. The Board's regulations define "harmful error" as an "[e]rror by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]; <span class="Italic">see Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1281. We have no basis to overturn the AJ's conclusion that Claus credibly testified that the removal action would have been taken notwithstanding any improper consideration of aggravating factors. Thus, even if the USPS committed procedural error in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(f) by relying on matters without providing Warren with adequate notice, the AJ concluded that Claus would have reached the same conclusion. The Board properly held that any procedural error was therefore harmless. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1282. There was also no error in the conduct of the hearing. Warren had opportunity to question Claus on the due process and harmful error issues, but asked questions only on the merits of the removal action, which were outside the scope of review on remand. Moreover, the Board correctly found that the AJ did not err on remand in limiting Claus's testimony on his decision-making process regarding the removal determination. In sum, Warren has failed to show that the Board abused its discretion in denying his petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aviles-Wynkoop v. DOD</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1908.OPINION.9-2-2020_1646608.pdf">825 Fed. Appx. 834</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), suggested that the decision is not deficient because language in the penalty analysis varies from that of the proposal if the appellant is on fair notice of what matters required a response:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop's second procedural challenge specified in her petition to the Board--that Mr. Russell "relied on several aggravating factors and characterizations not specified in the proposal notice." Specifically, Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop pointed to Mr. Russell's findings that her alleged misconduct caused a "hostile environment," that several employees submitted formal complaints to her supervisor, that she did not apologize for her behavior, that she was "progressively counseled" by a supervisor, and that her misconduct was both "impertinent" and "intimidating." But Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop has not shown that DoD failed to provide adequate "notice of the charges against" her in these respects. <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the letter proposing termination, DoD stated that Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop had previously been reprimanded for "inappropriate, overly aggressive, and unprofessional conduct" and had "explicitly exhibit[ed]...disdain and utter disrespect for contractors." The Board properly determined that these statements put Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop on notice that she was being accused of creating a "hostile environment" and of acting in a manner that was "impertinent" and "intimidating." Similarly, in the letter, DoD highlighted the August 13 meeting in which Ms. Ensley "gave [Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop] documentation regarding specific observations and concerns pertaining to [the conduct]." This statement, and the meeting itself, was enough to put Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop on notice that her coworkers had filed complaints about her behavior. DoD further stated in the letter of proposed termination that Ms. Ensley had on multiple occasions--once by email and once in person--advised Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop to modify her behavior. The reference to Ms. Ensley's communications provided sufficient notice of what Mr. Russell later used the words "progressively counseled" to describe. Finally, DoD stated in its letter that when Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop was confronted about her behavior, she "attempted unsuccessfully to justify [her] professional conduct." This statement sufficiently gave notice of DoD's belief in Ms. Aviles-Wynkoop's lack of remorse.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The proposal provides notice of factors influencing a penalty sufficient to avoid a due process reversal if the proposal is specific in its description of conduct and effects of the conduct; it need not list or specifically itemize each fact or factor influencing the penalty determination, as was indirectly demonstrated in <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. DHHS</span>, DE-0752-14-0488-I-1 (NP 2/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the first Stone factor, whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information was merely "cumulative" or was new information, regarding <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor three, the deciding official testified at the hearing that he based his decision that it was aggravating on the fact that a supervisor could lose trust in an employee who was "working alone in an FDA office" and who was responsible for "reviewing entries, protecting consumers...[and] making decisions about whether [products] would clear entry into the United States and then be used by the public," but failed to do so. These statements echo the ones included in the proposal letter stating that the appellant was "the sole CSO" in the agency's Denver office and as such, was "expected to be able to perform [his] job with little supervision," and to "hold clients accountable to FDA standards." Thus, the information relied on by the deciding official in determining that <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor three was aggravating already existed in the record and was not "new and material." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same is the case with <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor six, the appellant's potential for rehabilitation. In agreeing that he considered this factor as aggravating, the deciding official testified at the hearing that he found it difficult to recover from "a lack of trust or a lack of confidence" in an employee who misused a Government vehicle, and who potentially allowed products to enter commerce that were not properly screened because he was not on duty. This language closely tracks the language used in the proposal, which noted that "[m]anagement must be able to trust that each employee uses his or her [G]overnment equipment for the purpose in which it was intended," that management must be able to trust that each employee will report according to his or her designated tour of duty, and that the appellant's misconduct "seriously impacts [his] credibility."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Kent v. SSA</span>, DE-0752-17-0171-I-1 (NP 10/28/2022) ("Moreover, a deciding official may consider uncharged, similar misconduct in determining a penalty when the agency gave the appellant clear notice that it was relying upon that uncharged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 179, &#x00B6; 9 (2004). Here, as described by the administrative judge, the deciding official notified the appellant that he intended to consider the report that the appellant made inappropriate statements in his analysis of the appellant's potential for rehabilitation and the adequacy of alternate sanctions, given the report's similarity to two specifications of inappropriate conduct. The deciding official provided the appellant with an opportunity to reply to the report, and the appellant provided a reply denying the allegations regarding what he said.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board's application of <span class="Italic">Ward</span> can be difficult to follow, as is a passage from <span class="Italic">Camaj v. DHS</span>, NY-0752-11-0048-I-1 (NP 12/21/2012) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Camaj v. DHS</span>, 542 Fed. Appx. 933 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant has not proven by preponderant evidence that the deciding official spoke with the appellant's supervisors, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that such communications occurred, the topic of the communications was the appellant's trustworthiness. The appellant <span id="Page_3270"></span>was warned in the notice of proposed action that one reason for the proposed action was that management had "lost trust and confidence in" him. Thus, if the deciding official spoke with the appellant's supervisors regarding their ability to trust the appellant, no new information was introduced regarding this aggravating factor. Additionally, the deciding official asserted in his sworn deposition and at the hearing that he considered the appellant's past performance and disciplinary history to be mitigating factors. Therefore, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that these communications with the appellant's supervisors occurred, the penalty was not "enhanced" as a result and there was therefore no due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions occasionally seem to read a lot into broad phrases in a proposal to justify a deciding official's reliance on a more specific aggravating factor, as in <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-11-0690-B-1 (NP 9/26/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues on review that he was not on notice of the deciding official's consideration in her penalty determination of certain matters she deemed as aggravating factors, specifically, the notoriety of the offense and the appellant's being willfully defiant and insubordinate. As the administrative judge found, however, both of these matters were referenced in the notice of proposed removal, wherein the proposing official noted that the appellant initially refused to report for drug testing on the date identified and that, for a Lead Firefighter, the use of illegal drugs violates the special trust of the general public who rely on Firefighters to protect life and property....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the deciding official admits relying on factors not stated in the proposal, the Board may avoid assessing whether the information received or considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> was such that it placed undue pressure on the deciding official. Additionally, it is not of significance that the appellant was aware of the circumstances considered by the deciding official. The issue is whether the appellant was on notice before the reply opportunity that those factors were being considered by the deciding official, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA,</span> SF-0752-10-0628-I-2 (NP 7/27/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, our reviewing court held that, if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty[,] " an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. In determining whether there has been a due process violation, the Board must consider the facts and circumstances of each particular case. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the claimant to an entirely new administrative proceeding; rather, only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77. The introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice and the opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d<span class="Italic"></span> at 1377. When deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the inquiry of the Board is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Our reviewing court made clear that if the deciding official received new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, thereby violating an employee's due process rights, the violation is not subject to the harmless error test; instead, the employee is automatically entitled to an "entirely new" and "constitutionally correct" removal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. The Board may not excuse the constitutional violation as harmless error. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in the decision letter, the deciding official stated that he considered the appellant's years of service and past work record. In his sworn declaration, he averred that he considered the appellant's past work record and the appellant's potential for rehabilitation, noting the appellant's failure to seek counseling and refusal to sign the February 2009 "firm choice" letter and the proposal notice. This is corroborated by the deciding official's written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, which state that he considered the appellant's past disciplinary record, including, but not limited to, the appellant's two probationary terminations for attendance problems, the appellant's past work record (i.e., the appellant's length of service, his most recent performance rating, the deterioration of the appellant's ability to get along with fellow workers, and his resistance to supervisory instructions and formal counseling to obtain professional assistance), including his four terminations, two resignations and removal during a trial period, and the appellant's unlikely potential for rehabilitation based upon his refusal to sign the "firm choice" letter and the proposal notice. The proposal notice did not apprise the appellant of the agency's consideration of this information in imposing an enhanced penalty--it merely informed him that it considered the February 2009 "firm choice" letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors, information concerning the appellant's prior disciplinary, work, and military records and his unlikely potential for rehabilitation, which the deciding official considered in his penalty analysis, constitutes new rather than cumulative information. While the appellant was clearly aware of this information, the agency did not include it in its notice of proposed removal and, thus, it cannot be considered cumulative. Further, because the agency failed to advise the appellant that it considered such information in proposing to remove him, the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there is no evidence that the deciding official's consideration of such information resulted in undue pressure on him to remove the appellant, that is only one of several factors, and not the ultimate inquiry, in determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication resulted in a constitutional violation under the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. As the Federal Circuit recognized, "the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding [o]fficial admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination," making the "materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications...self-evident from the [d]eciding [o]fficial's admission." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, while no clear evidence of undue pressure exists in the record, the deciding official's written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, sworn declaration, and the decision notice are clear evidence of the materiality of the information received through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in imposing an enhanced penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the deciding official's consideration of such aggravating factors without the appellant's knowledge was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Consequently, because the agency violated the appellant's due process guarantee to notice, the agency's error cannot be excused as harmless, and the appellant's removal must be cancelled. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. The agency may not remove the appellant unless and until he is afforded a "new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although it is unclear whether the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official to remove the appellant, in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Federal Circuit emphasized that this is but one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry. 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. The deciding official's testimony is clear evidence of the materiality of the QAR incident in his decision to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consideration of poor performance, not noticed in the adverse action proposal, was sufficient to set aside a removal under <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 118 MSPR 106, 109-10 &#x00B6; 6, 2012 MSPB 61 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information at issue related to the assertion by the agency that the appellant's audit production was much lower than other journeyman auditors, specifically that his four year output was less than the agency's individual production goal for a single year and generally that his performance was poor. We find that this information is not cumulative because it concerned specific information of alleged performance deficiencies of which the appellant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond in this action. <span class="Italic">See Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011); <span class="Italic">see also Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376 (procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency). Moreover, in a situation like this, where the deciding official has admitted that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information influenced his penalty determination, the information in question is clearly material. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (citing <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2). We further find that, because the agency omitted this information from the notice of proposed removal, the appellant was unaware that the deciding official would consider it and had no chance to respond before the deciding official issued his decision. With respect to whether the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official, the Federal Circuit has recognized that the absence of such pressure may be <span id="Page_3271"></span>less relevant when, as in this case, the deciding official admits that the information influenced his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Therefore, we find that the deciding official's consideration of such aggravating factors without the appellant's knowledge was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received a 30-day suspension from her Equal Opportunity Specialist position based on a single charge of unprofessional behavior with two underlying specifications. In the proposal notice, the agency alleged in narrative specifications that the appellant, in part, engaged in the following misconduct: (1) On December 14, 2007, the appellant interrupted a conversation between her supervisor, Darlene Pickett, and Shirley D. Thomas, stating that the human resources department is not telling the truth and they are out to get the complainant; the appellant then pointed a finger in Ms. Pickett's face, called her a liar while using a loud voice, and also called District Director Kraak a liar; and on January 8, 2008, while Ms. Pickett was conducting a case update meeting, the appellant loudly interrupted Ms. Pickett's instruction that a certain case should be investigated by asking her where she got her law degree. When Ms. Pickett responded that she did not have a law degree, the appellant allegedly stated, "I know you are not an attorney [and] that is why you don't know anything." The proposal notice also indicated that the appellant had previously received a 14-day suspension for unprofessional conduct from October 1 to October 14, 2007, and a notice of official reprimand for unprofessional conduct on July 6, 2006.<span class="Italic"></span> The proposal notice did not identify the agency's intention to rely on any other prior misconduct by the appellant.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that the agency committed harmful procedural error and violated the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) when Ms. Kraak considered, without giving notice to the appellant, five memoranda to the file prepared by Ms. Pickett, which documented prior instances of similar misconduct by the appellant. In her closing argument, below, the appellant further contended that Ms. Kraak's reliance upon these memoranda was a violation of due process....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has held that, when a deciding official receives new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, "then a due process violation has occurred and the former employee is entitled to a new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,</span> 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> the deciding official received <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> memoranda recommending removal of the employee after the employee had received a notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1372. The court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The introduction of new and material information by means of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications to the deciding official undermines the public employee's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and of the employer's evidence) and the opportunity to respond. When deciding officials receive such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, employees are no longer on notice of the reasons for their dismissal and/or the evidence relied upon by the agency. Procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[N]ot every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is a procedural defect so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the appellant to an entirely new administrative proceeding. Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1376-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> the Federal Circuit relied upon certain factors in determining whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introduce new and material information: (1) whether the information is merely cumulative; (2) whether the employee knew of and had an opportunity to respond to the information; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications would likely result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1377. The ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> the court further found that the Supreme Court, in the seminal case of <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 543 (1985),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">expressly noted that the need for a meaningful opportunity [to respond] ...is important in enabling the agency to reach an accurate result for two reasons. First, dismissals for cause will often involve factual disputes and consideration of the employee's response may help clarify such disputes. In addition, even if the facts are clear, "the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be; in such cases, the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1376 <span class="Italic">(quoting Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 543). The Federal Circuit thereafter concluded that "the Supreme Court expressly recognized that the employee's response is essential not only to the issue of whether the allegations are true, but also with regard to whether the level of penalty to be imposed is appropriate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record here shows that Ms. Kraak was interviewed during the investigation of a factually related discrimination complaint filed by the appellant, and completed an EEO Investigative Affidavit under penalty of perjury. In the affidavit, Ms. Kraak acknowledged that she was the deciding official in the 30-day suspension at issue in this appeal. She stated, in response to question 34 ("On what facts did you base your decision that [the] Complainant would receive this discipline?"), the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The facts that I relied on in making the decision are the Notice of Proposed Suspension issued by Darlene Picket [sic] on March 28, 2008. In that memo it describes Ms. Silberman's unprofessional conduct on two separate dates (December 14, 2007 and January 8, 2008). Both incidents were witnessed by other employees in the Chicago District Office. The more disruptive and threatening of the two incidents occurring on January 8, 2008. I took into account Ms. Silberman's prior discipline including the 14 day suspension and the written reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I also took into fact [sic] the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Factors (Attachment 6). Considering each factor and determining its relevance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Ms. Kraak further clarified this response in question 40 ("Did she [the appellant] have prior discipline on which you relied in this discipline?"), where she stated the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Ms.&#x2003;Silberman has had prior discipline relative to unprofessional conduct. From July 13, 2005 to May 22, 2006 there were five separate instances where the immediate supervisor wrote a memo regarding Ms. Silberman's unprofessional conduct. On June 30, 2006, Ms. Silberman had another incident and she was issued a written reprimand on July 7, 2006. On March 20, 2007 she again engaged in unprofessional conduct and was subsequently suspended for 14 days (Attachment 8 and 8a). After that suspension, there were 2 additional incidents [Ms. Silberman] was issued a written reprimand describing the [sic] to the file with regard to the conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The administrative judge determined that the information contained in the five memoranda concerned the appellant's history of rude and disrespectful behavior, that Ms. Kraak's statements were made in response to a question regarding the appellant's prior discipline, and that there was no indication that Ms. Kraak relied upon this information in determining whether to sustain the charge. The administrative judge further found that Ms. Kraak properly considered the information only in her determination of the penalty as part of the appellant's past work record and ability to get along with fellow workers under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981), and, in that sense, the five memoranda were merely cumulative under <span class="Italic">Stone</span> because they supported the conclusion that the appellant had a propensity to engage in rude and disrespectful conduct in her past work history. The administrative judge also determined that this information did not place undue pressure on Ms. Kraak to rule in a certain way because she had previously disciplined the appellant by a 14-day suspension for the same type of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge did not specifically cite our precedent on this issue, it appears that he may have relied, in part, on a line of Board cases holding that, where <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information does not relate to the charge itself, but relates instead to the penalty, we would not consider such an error as a denial of due process of law to be analyzed under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone;</span> rather we would analyze the error by applying the harmful error standard in our analysis of the penalty factors. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 10 (2009); <span class="Italic">Biniak v. Social Security Administration,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 682, &#x00B6; 10 (2002); <span class="Italic">Groeber v.

Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 625, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12 (1999). However, the Federal Circuit recently overruled this precedent in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and has directed the Board to consider <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with regard to penalty as a <span class="Italic">Stone</span> due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> the agency removed the appellant for shouting at his supervisor, <span id="Page_3272"></span>acting in a manner that she perceived as threatening, and disobeying her instruction to remain in her office. <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1276. The notice of proposed removal only referenced the charged misconduct and did not reference any other misconduct by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At hearing, the deciding official testified that before making his decision, he spoke to three supervisors and a manager who discussed prior incidents in which the appellant exhibited loud, belligerent and intimidating behavior. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The deciding official further admitted that the appellant's "recurring pattern of behavior" affected his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board affirmed the appellant's removal and considered the agency's consideration of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information as harmful procedural error. Upon review, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's holding, ruling instead that, under <span class="Italic">Stone,</span> the appellant's due process rights fully apply to an agency's penalty decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1279-80. The court remanded the appeal for a determination of whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications at issue there were new and material information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the agency argued below that five memoranda considered by Ms. Kraak were cumulative and not new and material information because they were merely background that could properly be considered under several <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. However, the record shows that the information extended beyond Ms. Kraak's general background understanding of the appellant's work history, inability to get along with her supervisor and coworkers, and potential for rehabilitation. As noted above, the undisputed record shows Ms. Kraak testified in her affidavit that, in making her decision to discipline the appellant, she considered, as prior discipline, that the appellant had engaged in several additional instances of rude and disrespectful behavior between July 2005 and May 2006. We find that this information cannot be considered merely cumulative because, although it is similar in nature to the charged misconduct and the prior discipline cited in the notice of proposed action, it concerned specific incidents of alleged misconduct of which the appellant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond.[4] <span class="Italic">See Stone,</span> 179 F.3d at 1376 (procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency). Furthermore, the Federal Circuit has noted that, <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is plainly material when the deciding official has admitted that the information influenced his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Similarly, Ms. Kraak's specific identification of the five memoranda as factors in her decision shows that the five memoranda were material to her decision in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We are unaware of any precedent concerning whether <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information of alleged misconduct may be cumulative under <span class="Italic">Stone</span> merely because it is similar in nature to allegations already contained in the agency's notice of proposed action. However, we note that the cases that have found <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information cumulative have involved incidents where the deciding official received information related to incidents already identified in the agency's notice of proposed action. For example, this case is unlike the situation where the deciding official initiated <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that only confirmed or clarified information already contained in the record. <span class="Italic">See Blank v. Department of the Army,</span> 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (finding no <span class="Italic">Stone</span> violation when the deciding official conducted investigatory interviews and communications to confirm or clarify allegations in the pending charges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge's determination that the consideration of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information did not place undue pressure on Ms. Kraak does not preclude a finding of denial of due process. In <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> the court clarified that the undue pressure factor is only one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. The court added that, although <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications of a type likely to result in undue pressure may make it more likely that an appellant was deprived of due process, the lack of undue pressure may be less relevant to finding a constitutional violation where the deciding official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication influenced his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the deciding official's <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration of the five memoranda undermined the appellant's constitutional due process guarantee of notice (both of the charges and of the agency's evidence) and of the opportunity to respond. Consequently, the 30-day suspension must be reversed and this matter remanded to the agency to afford the appellant constitutionally correct procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see Goldenberg v. Bureau of Prisons</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210816121">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) (mention of a prior suspension by a deciding official did not result in reversal of a removal when the evidence showed the deciding official did not rely on that suspension in determining the removal penalty).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-11-0033-I-1 (NP 9/30/2011), reversed a suspension because of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration by the deciding official of the appellant's disrespect to his supervisor, creation of a workplace disturbance, and sleeping on duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official's written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors indicates that he considered conduct that was not charged in the notice of proposed suspension. Applying the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors, information concerning past misconduct similar to that in the proposal notice constitutes new, rather than cumulative, information. Further, because the agency failed to advise the appellant that it considered such information in proposing to suspend him, the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although there is no evidence that the deciding official's consideration of such information resulted in undue pressure on him to suspend the appellant, that is only one of several factors, and not the ultimate inquiry, in determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication resulted in a constitutional violation under the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. As the Federal Circuit recognized, "the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding [o]fficial admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination," making the "materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications...self-evident from the [d]eciding [o]fficial's admission." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, while no clear evidence of undue pressure exists in the record, the deciding official's written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is clear evidence of the materiality of the information received through <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in imposing an enhanced penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ciciotti v. DOJ,</span> CH-0752-10-0339-I-1 (NP 8/9/2011), provides another example of an action reversed based on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration of aggravating penalty factors:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the removal penalty was unreasonable. He also asserts that the deciding official and the administrative judge improperly weighed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining the appropriate penalty for his misconduct. In examining the penalty issue, we find that it was inappropriate for the deciding official to consider the appellant's conduct towards a deputy sheriff during a cross-examination in a state court action as an aggravating factor in his penalty analysis in violation of the appellant's due process guarantee of notice. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14 (2011); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 12 (2011); <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not contend, and the record does not reflect, that the appellant was aware that the agency was considering his conduct during cross-examination as an aggravating factor. The appellant is an attorney, and he was exercising his right to cross-examine the deputy sheriff in the state court proceeding to which the agency was not a party. During the hearing on his Board appeal, the appellant's attorney argued that it was improper for the deciding official to consider the appellant's conduct during the state court hearing in making his decision to remove the appellant, and we agree. The agency responded by asserting that the deciding official had properly considered the appellant's conduct towards the deputy sheriff during the state court action in determining his potential for rehabilitation and in applying the other <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, although the state court proceeding was not part of the charged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official clearly testified that he considered the appellant's conduct in cross-examining the deputy sheriff as evidence that the appellant had no remorse and no rehabilitation potential. The deciding official also identified the appellant's conduct towards the deputy sheriff during cross-examination as a factor he considered in his written evaluation of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Yet the agency did not include this alleged misconduct as a factor in the notice of proposed removal or the decision letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency intends to rely on aggravating factors as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advance notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the agency's deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5 (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 304 (1981)). In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the Federal Circuit recently held that if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty[,] " an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a constitutional due process violation. 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 6.<span class="Italic"></span> When such circumstances are present, the court directed the Board to analyze whether the additional aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty constituted new and material information under the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d. 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999). <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 6. The court in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> made clear that, if a constitutional violation has occurred, it cannot be considered a harmless error and the agency action must be reversed. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and its progeny, which were issued after the initial <span id="Page_3273"></span>decision on this appeal, we find that the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's conduct during cross-examination of the deputy sheriff in the state court proceeding constituted new and material information in light of the fact that the agency failed to advise the appellant that it would consider such information in determining the appropriate penalty. We further find that the deciding official's consideration of this aggravating factor without notice to the appellant was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13 (quoting <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377); <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, because the agency violated the appellant's due process rights, we cannot excuse the agency's error as harmless, and we must cancel the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13 (citing <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280); <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 12 (same).<span class="Italic"></span> The agency cannot remove the appellant unless and until he is afforded a new "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pace v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CB-7121-11-0010-V-3 (NP 11/18/2013), reviewing an arbitrator's award, reversed a removal based on the deciding official's improper consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Importantly, the deciding official testified that he considered this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in the context of Charge 2, inappropriate and unprofessional conduct in the workplace, which included a specification that the appellant used sexually inappropriate language towards a female manager. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hearing Transcript at 257-61 (the deciding official admitted that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information "made [him] think that [the appellant] was more likely to have made the comments he was being accused of" in Charge 2). Moreover, in his handwritten notes regarding the decision, the deciding official included a reference to the name of the female employee who made the allegation of sexual harassment against the appellant that was not included in the proposal notice. The deciding official ultimately sustained the relevant specification in Charge 2 and the charge itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Rather, it was apparent from the deciding official's testimony and the record evidence that this allegation played a role in his analysis of Charge 2. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (The deciding official's specific identification of the five memoranda as factors in her decision shows that the five memoranda were material to her decision in this case). Under these circumstances, we find that the deciding official's consideration of this information without the appellant's knowledge was "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">When an agency relied on <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment to remove a law enforcement officer, failure to provide proper notice of the alleged impairment in the proposal, and reliance on it by the deciding official, resulted in reversal of a removal for violation of minimum constitutional due process guarantees in <span class="Italic">Solis v.

Reversal of an adverse action resulted from reliance of the deciding official on <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> concerns, even though the proposal, not mentioning <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>, referenced a loss of confidence in the appellant, <span class="Italic">Carbajal v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-16-0005-I-1 (NP 9/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency certifies that it has provided the requisite interim relief and argues that <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> is not applicable to the determination of any due process violations. The agency also argues that the notice of proposed removal informed the appellant that it had lost confidence in his ability to perform his duties, which includes his ability to testify in court. It contends that its action does not violate the due process considerations set forth in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, asserts that any error "was not only harmless, but [was] dwarfed by the weight of evidence and seriousness of the offense," and stresses that testifying is a small part of the appellant's duties, which the deciding official only mentioned in dutifully fulfilling his obligation to conduct a proper analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. The appellant responds in opposition to the agency's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following factors are used to determine if <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is new and material: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information introduced cumulative, as opposed to new, information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had an opportunity to respond; and (3) whether the communication was of the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Pursuant to the <span class="Italic">Ward</span>/<span class="Italic">Stone</span> line of authority, when an agency intends to rely on an aggravating factor as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors must be included in the agency's advance notice of the adverse action so that the employee will have a fair and complete opportunity to respond to those factors before the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 10 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not shown that the administrative judge erred in applying the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors. As to the first two, we agree that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication regarding the effect of the appellant's misconduct on his ability to testify in criminal proceedings introduced new and material, and not merely cumulative, information.<span class="Italic"> See Solis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 10 (deciding that reliance on testimonial impairment without providing notice and an opportunity to respond cannot be fairly deemed cumulative or immaterial). The notice of proposed removal clearly did not mention the impact of the appellant's misconduct on his future ability to testify in criminal matters. This omission precluded any response from him on the issue, and we agree that the deciding official's citation of that factor in his analysis indicates that it is material. <span class="Italic">See Pickett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (stating that the deciding official's testimony, that certain rumors about the appellant played even "a minor role" in his decision to remove him, "weigh[ed] strongly in favor" of finding that the new information was material); <span class="Italic">see also Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). Moreover, regardless of the negligible portion of the appellant's duties that actually involve testifying in court, the pertinent issue before us is the deciding official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis of this factor. The deciding official's consideration of this issue not only belies the agency's insistence on review that the factor is of minimal importance, it also contradicts the agency's assertion on review that the notice of proposed removal put the appellant on notice when the notice questioned his ability to perform the essential duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reliance on allegedly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information concerning <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> also arose in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BENNETT_BRIAN_E_DE_0752_11_0445_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_884176.pdf">119 MSPR 685</a>, 690-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 2013 MSPB 64 (2013). A supervisory criminal investigator was removed for several charges, including providing false information to a law enforcement officer in the course of an official inquiry. After the reply, the assigned HR specialist was asked for and provided to the deciding official information on comparators. That information made some mention of impairment of the effectiveness as a witness of a law enforcement officer who was found to have provided false information during official business--the <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment. The AJ concluded that the decision to remove the appellant was in part based on <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> concerns--concerns unknown to the appellant because those concerns were not specifically raised in the removal proposal. The agency appealed the resulting reversal on due process grounds, providing to the Board the deciding official's affidavit that she did not consider <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> issues. Without ruling on the appellant's motion to strike the affidavit, the Board commented that "[c]urrently, the record is insufficiently developed to determine whether the deciding official's knowledge of the information in the email served as a basis for her determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed," and remanded for the AJ to consider whether the deciding official relied on knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> information contained in an email from the HR specialist:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A deciding official's knowledge of information only raises due process or procedural concerns where that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Norris v.

Cir. 2012) ("A deciding official's knowledge of an employee's background only raises due process or procedural concerns where that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed."). Currently, the record is insufficiently developed to determine whether the deciding official's knowledge of the information in the email served as a basis for her determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency submits the deciding official's affidavit on review in which she denies considering this information, as the hearing official, the administrative judge is in the best position to resolve this question in the first instance. <span class="Italic">Durr v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 15 (2013); <span class="Italic">see Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We therefore find that remand is necessary for further development of the record in order to address the potential due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987) (to resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must identify the factual questions in dispute, summarize the evidence on each disputed question, state which version he believes, and explain in detail why he found the chosen version more credible, considering such factors as: (1) the witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness's character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement <span id="Page_3274"></span>by the witness; (4) a witness's bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events; and (7) the witness's demeanor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, in accordance with the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the administrative judge must determine whether the deciding official relied on this information, and, if so, whether such reliance rises to the level of a due process violation. In conducting her analysis, the administrative judge should allow the parties to provide additional relevant evidence and argument regarding the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors, including further hearing testimony. If a due process violation is found, the administrative judge must reverse the agency's action and order the agency to restore the appellant until he is afforded a "new constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. If no due process violation is found, the administrative judge should then determine whether the agency committed harmful error within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) and (c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1) and 1201.4(r)]. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1281-82.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DC-0752-14-0237-I-1 (NP 5/27/2015), ascertained no due process violation as to sections of penalty analysis in a proposal that provided notice of possible <span class="Italic">Giglio</span> impairment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The application of this <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor to the charged misconduct was self-evident. Although the proposal notice did not specifically discuss <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor 8, Clarity of Notice, the appellant was notified that the agency considered this an aggravating factor, and he made no claim that he was unaware of the need to report auto accidents, to refrain from driving his GOV after consuming alcohol, or to respond fully and truthfully during an agency investigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The proposal notice stated that a special agent who is deemed <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired impeaches that agent's credibility as a witness, severely hampering the agency's mission, and that his misconduct "seriously impairs the Service's and public's ability to rely on your veracity." This gave the appellant fair notice that all aspects of his veracity and credibility were at issue, including whether his lack of candor had been intentional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, a lack of candor charge "necessarily involves a degree of deception," and may involve lying under oath as well as a failure to reply fully and truthfully. <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1284-85. Although a charge of lack of candor does not necessarily require proof of the specific intent required for a falsification charge, it does necessarily entail an allegation that the misconduct at issue was deceptive, which by its very nature is intentional.[11] Thus, the agency was not required to notify the appellant that it intended to "aggravate" the penalty on the basis that his lack of candor was intentional.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Payton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-14-0055-I-1, Final Order (Jan. 29, 2015), the Board determined in a nonprecedential decision that because neither of the sustained charges--which included a charge of lack of candor--required proof of intent, the deciding official erred in considering the intentional nature of the appellant's misconduct without advanced notice. We decline to follow <span class="Italic">Payton</span> to the extent that it holds that a deciding official violates due process by considering, without notice, the inherently deceptive nature of the conduct underlying any lack of candor charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination by a deciding official that an employee is <span class="Italic">Giglio</span>-impaired, without notifying the employee in the proposal notice that this would be considered, would present significant due process problems. <span class="Italic">See Bennett</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11; <span class="Italic">Solis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sill v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-0752-11-0564-I-1 (NP 6/19/2012), set aside a removal because a prior counseling record was not referenced in the removal proposal, but the counseling was mentioned in the proposing official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> worksheet:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that both the appellant's prior record of counseling and the witness statements at issue were new and material evidence not provided to the appellant. The agency asserts that even though it failed to mention the appellant's prior record of counseling in the notice of proposed removal, the proposing official mentioned it in his written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis. Because the proposing official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis was among the materials relied upon to support the proposal, and the notice of proposed removal gave the appellant an opportunity to receive and review those materials before the agency issued its decision, the agency contends that the appellant therefore "was made aware of and had ample time to respond to the use of his prior verbal counseling."<span class="Italic"></span> Nevertheless, the agency cites no authority in support of its argument, and we note that even if the agency had provided the appellant with the actual document instead of just affording him the opportunity to request it, it would not aid the agency's case. Whatever the proposing official considered before he wrote his proposal, the fact that he left the appellant's prior verbal counseling out of the notice of proposed removal indicates that the agency would not rely on that factor in its penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, improper consideration of past counseling letters caused an adverse action to be reversed for lack of due process in the reply stage, <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CH-0752-11-0434-I-1 (NP 8/10/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's reliance on these six letters of counseling without providing the appellant with notice and an opportunity to respond to them cannot fairly be deemed cumulative or immaterial to the deciding official's decision. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77. These letters of counseling are not in the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration file, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that they were part of the evidence provided to the appellant. Further, the information in the letters of counseling extended beyond the deciding official's understanding of the appellant's work history and the misconduct the agency charged the appellant with in the notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">See Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). Rather, based on the letter of removal, they concerned specific instances of alleged misconduct of which the appellant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12. Accordingly, such information cannot be considered cumulative. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12. Although it is unclear whether the information resulted in undue pressure on the deciding official to remove the appellant, the Federal Circuit has emphasized that this is but one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2; <span class="Italic">see Silverman</span>, 166 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 13. Thus, we find that the agency violated the appellant's due process rights by denying her notice of the specific information considered and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The deciding official's testimony at the Board hearing that he relied on some oral counselings not noted in the proposal sufficed to set the removal aside, <span class="Italic">Bailey v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-0752-13-0096-I-1 (NP 6/6/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency challenges the administrative judge's finding that a due process violation occurred. The agency argues that it satisfied its obligation because, in the notice of proposed removal, it put the appellant on notice that it would consider her oral counselings, informing her that it was relying upon her entire history of discipline and prior acts of misconduct. The agency further argues that, because the appellant was aware of her own prior acts of misconduct, "the agency did not need to spell these out for her." And, the agency urges that the appellant never argued below that the agency violated her due process rights with regard to the counselings. Finally, the agency argues that the Board should affirm its chosen penalty because removal does not exceed the maximum reasonable penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the proposing official stated in the notice of proposed removal that, in determining the action to propose, he considered that the appellant had "a lengthy record of misconduct with the Agency." He then specifically mentioned an oral admonishment, a written reprimand, a 3-day suspension, and a 14-day suspension. In her decision letter, the deciding official stated only that she considered the appellant's "past disciplinary record." However, when asked at the hearing to elaborate on the appellant's previous discipline that she considered, the deciding official testified for the first time that "Well, she had already received numerous counseling sessions, had numerous violations for parking...." The appellant was counseled on three occasions for specific instances of alleged misconduct and the agency documented the counselings. Because she was not informed that the deciding official considered these counselings, this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication may constitute a constitutional due process violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not shown that the administrative judge erred in applying the three <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors. As to the first factor, she properly found, based on the deciding official's testimony as set forth above, that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication introduced new and material, not merely cumulative, information. <span class="Italic">See Pickett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (the deciding official's testimony, that the rumor about the appellant played "a minor role" in his decision to remove him, "weighs strongly in favor" of finding that the new information was material); <span class="Italic">see also Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). Moreover, as the administrative judge noted, the types of misconduct at issue in the counselings were different than, and not implicated by, the charged misconduct in this removal action. And, the fact that the counselings were known to the appellant does not render, as the agency suggests, the information cumulative. <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3275"></span>As to the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant did not know of the agency's error until the date of the hearing and therefore did not have a meaningful opportunity to respond to it. We reject the agency's assertion that, because the proposal notice referred to the appellant's "lengthy record of misconduct," she was aware that the agency was relying on the counselings, and she therefore had an opportunity to respond to them. As noted earlier, the proposing official followed the quoted language with specific mention of four elements of the appellant's past record, but did not mention the counselings. And, as to the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the administrative judge found it unclear whether the information actually resulted in undue pressure upon the deciding official to decide upon removal, but that that factor is not the ultimate inquiry. We agree. Our reviewing court has held that this factor is less relevant where, as here, the deciding official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication influenced her decision. <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find unavailing the agency's argument that the appellant failed to argue below that the agency had violated her due process rights. As noted, the appellant did not become aware until the hearing that the deciding official had considered the counselings, and the appellant argued in her closing statement that such consideration was improper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reference in a decision to appellant's failure to cooperate with his supervisor was a factor not stated in a proposal to remove the appellant for irregular attendance and similar past discipline established a due process violation in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-12-0358-I-1 (3/29/2013); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Whitiker v. VA</span>, DE-0752-12-0164-I-1 (NP 6/18/2013) ("The agency, however, did not charge the appellant with an alleged lack of candor during the fact-finding; it only charged the appellant for his lack of candor on September 20 and September 21, 2011. In addition, the agency did not alert the appellant that it would be considering his alleged lack of candor during the fact-finding in assessing the penalty. Therefore, by taking into account the appellant's alleged lack of candor during the fact-finding, the deciding official relied on an aggravating factor not identified in the proposal to remove, as in <span class="Italic">Jenkins</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 12. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency denied the appellant due process because it deprived him of notice of all the evidence being used against him and the opportunity to respond to it. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280."). A due process violation occurred when the deciding official, in an appeal involving a charged physical altercation, visited the scene of the incident, relied upon information gleaned from the visit, and also relied on appellant's occasional public contact--not a factor noted in the proposal--to sustain removal. <span class="Italic">Terrano v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0369-I-1 (NP 9/11/2014); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rogers v.

<p class="Body-Text">The deciding official's reliance on the aggravating factor of appellant's withdrawal from a post-proposal settlement, lessening the credibility of the appellant in the deciding official's opinion, was reason enough to set aside the adverse action decision, <span class="Italic">Edgin v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-12-0767-I-1 (NP 12/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Upon our review of the record, however, we find that the deciding official considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information outside of the scope of the notice of proposed removal in violation of <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span>, thus requiring the reversal of the agency's removal action. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undisputed record reflects that the deciding official considered the appellant's withdrawal from the settlement agreement as an aggravating factor in his decision to remove the appellant from employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 10 at 58-59 (letter of decision finding the appellant's credibility lessened because of his decision to breach the settlement agreement). The appellant's withdrawal from the settlement agreement, however, postdated the notice of proposed removal and is not included in the agency's notice of proposed adverse action. The deciding official's reliance upon the appellant's conduct post-dating the notice of proposed removal as an aggravating factor, without notice to the appellant, constitutes a due process violation under <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> if the information considered by the deciding official is new and material information that is "so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 11 (2012) (quoting <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279). When determining whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is constitutionally impermissible, the Board will consider, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, whether the communication introduces cumulative rather than new information; whether the appellant had an opportunity to respond to the information; and whether the communication was the type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decisions applying <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> make clear that a deciding official cannot rely upon an aggravating factor, such as a negative credibility determination, based on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information which is not cited in the agency's notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10 (when an agency intends to rely on an aggravating factor as the basis for the imposition of a penalty, such factors should be included in the advanced notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to those factors before the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Kolenc v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22 (2013) (finding a due process violation based upon the deciding official's reliance on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information which affected his findings regarding the appellant's credibility with regard to all of the charged misconduct). In rendering his final decision, the deciding official made an adverse credibility determination based upon information outside of the notice of proposed removal without giving the appellant an opportunity to respond, and the deciding official expressly relied upon this information in rendering his decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 10 at 58-59; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 23 (agency's narrative response explaining that the deciding official took into consideration that he and the appellant entered into a settlement agreement allowing the appellant to resume an assignment as a PTF letter carrier but that the appellant breached the settlement by failing to withdraw his MSPB appeal as agreed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span>, we find that this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is new information which the appellant did not have an opportunity to respond to, and that this information influenced the deciding official's penalty determination based upon his express reliance upon this information in his letter of decision. <span class="Italic">See Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.

We therefore conclude that the deciding official's express reliance upon an aggravating factor which was not included in the appellant's notice of proposed removal constitutes a <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> due process violation which requires the reversal of the appellant's removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant did not raise a due process claim either before the administrative judge or on petition for review, and that the administrative judge did not identify or address such a claim in her initial decision. We have held, however, that the Board may address clear errors of law <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> when "necessary to prevent manifest injustice." <span class="Italic">Powers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, it is undisputed that the deciding official relied upon the appellant's conduct post-dating the agency's notice of proposed removal in rendering his decision without notifying the appellant that he would consider such conduct as an aggravating factor. The agency, moreover, cited the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's conduct in its submissions to the administrative judge, and it again cites to the appellant's conduct in its opposition to the petition for review. Under these facts, where the agency's reliance upon <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in violation of <span class="Italic">Ward/Stone</span> not only appears on the face of the record, but also has been acknowledged by the agency in multiple submissions to the Board, we find that addressing the due process issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Robinson</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 444, 449 n.3 (administrative judges and the Board have, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, refused to turn a blind eye to clear error that affected an appellant's rights).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Inclusion in a decision letter of information, expressed for the first time, leading the deciding official to consider as an aggravating factor his lessened opinion of the appellant's credibility or of his opinion that she tried to deceive the agency, caused a due process reversal in <span class="Italic">Halfacre v.

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant raises a matter during the reply and the deciding official then takes that into consideration as to the penalty, there is no due process violation, and the deciding official is not obliged, having heard the information, to inform the appellant prior to making a decision of the weight that information will carry in the decision. That occurred in <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

The appellant was investigated based on an assertion that she misused the agency's enforcement communications system for personal gain. At the conclusion of the investigation, the agency proposed her discharge for misuse of the system and other charges. The proposal did not assert that the appellant shared information from the communications system <span id="Page_3276"></span>with her ex-husband or other unauthorized individuals. Appellant challenged the removal decision, asserting that as an aggravating factor was the deciding official's belief that the appellant shared with her ex-husband the information obtained from the system. The Board determined that having herself raised at the reply to the proposal the issue of improper sharing of information, the appellant was not deprived of a constitutionally adequate reply when the deciding official then assessed the information provided by the appellant as to the adverse action charge and concluded that sharing of the information was an aggravating factor. The deciding official also testified that his decision would have been the same without consideration of the charge that related to the information disclosure because other charges, sustained by the Board, would have led the deciding official to remove the appellant, leading the Board to conclude in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> that the deciding official's consideration of the information disclosure was not material to the penalty determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, a public employee has a property interest in his continued employment, the government cannot deprive him of that interest without due process. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985). The Supreme Court has described the requirements of due process as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 at 546. As the Court explained in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, the need for a meaningful opportunity for the employee to present his side of the story is important for two reasons. First, an adverse action "will often involve factual disputes," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 543, and consideration of the employee's response may clarify such disputes, <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>). Second, "[e]ven where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 543. Thus, the "the employee's response is essential not only to the issue of whether the allegations are true, but also with regard to whether the level of penalty to be imposed is appropriate." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376 (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the court of appeals stressed that an agency's consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication violates due process only when the information introduced was new and material. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In making such a determination, the Board may consider, among other factors: (1) whether the information is cumulative, rather than new; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the communication was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. Ultimately, the inquiry is whether the deciding official's consideration of the additional material was substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property absent an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has determined that this analysis applies not only to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing information that was previously unknown to the deciding official, but also to information personally known and considered by the deciding official, if that information was not included in the notice of proposed removal to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011). When a deciding official considers either type of information, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a potential constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Our reviewing court recently noted that "[w]here an employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence and the deciding official considers new and material information, procedural due process guarantees are not met because the employee is no longer on notice of the reasons for dismissal and/or of the evidence relied upon by the agency." <span class="Italic">Young v. Housing and Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2013). It has similarly recognized that the regulation governing adverse actions requires that an "agency will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action and any answer of the employee or his or her representative, or both, made to a designated official...." <span class="Italic">Norris v. Securities and Exchange Commission</span>, 675 F.3d 1349, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g)(1)). Consequently, when an agency relies on an aggravating factor in imposing a penalty, it should identify the factor in the notice of adverse action so that the employee will have a fair opportunity to respond to it before the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See Solis v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 7 (2012); <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no question but that the deciding official based his penalty determination, in part, on an aggravating factor not cited in the proposal notice. Specifically, although the proposal notice and decision letter contained no allegation that the appellant had shared TECS information with unauthorized individuals, the deciding official indicated on the "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Factors Checklist" that "[r]unning records checks for personal reasons and <span class="Italic">sharing information with unauthorized individuals</span> seriously undermines th[e] public trust." The deciding official further testified in his deposition that he concluded, based on the record as a whole, that the appellant had improperly shared the information she obtained from her searches with her ex-husband, although she had not been charged with doing so. In addition, the deciding official testified at the hearing that, even though the allegation of the appellant's unauthorized disclosure was not substantiated, he concluded that she did share information with unauthorized individuals and found that to be an aggravating factor. However, as we discuss below, the appellant, when she made her reply, clearly raised the issue of whether she shared the TECS information. Without making a specific finding as to whether the deciding official considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in making his penalty determination, we conclude that, under the circumstances present here, the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's allegedly unauthorized disclosure did not undermine her right to due process. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant had an opportunity to, and, in fact, did respond to the allegations of unauthorized disclosure. The appellant's responses consisted of a 31-page written reply, a 11/2-hour-long oral presentation, and a telephonic voice mail message to the deciding official supplementing her written and oral replies. In her written reply, the appellant wrote "I never shared TECS information with [my ex-husband] or anyone else," "I did not disseminate any TECS information to [my ex-husband] or anyone else," and "I did not make TECS inquiries for personal or financial gain nor did I disseminate any TECS information to [my ex-husband] or anyone else." Thus, the record reflects not only that the appellant raised the issue of the unauthorized disclosure in her replies but repeatedly responded to it. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's consideration of her allegedly unauthorized disclosure did not deprive her of due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant argues that these repeated references to her allegedly unauthorized disclosure were merely "stated in passing" and so were not meaningful enough to show that she was sufficiently aware of how the deciding official would consider this information. We disagree and concur, instead, with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's responses to the possible disclosure issue "were specific and significant." Moreover, we reject the appellant's arguments to the extent that they are premised on the notion that she was entitled to know the particular weight that the agency would attach to the allegations of her unauthorized disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found credible the deciding official's testimony that his conclusion that the appellant had shared TECS information with her ex-husband did not enhance the penalty because he would have removed the appellant based on either the Lack of Candor or the Failure to Cooperate charges alone. <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1259-60 (Fed. Cir. 1999). As such, we find that the information was not material to the penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant failed to prove her harmful error claim. The administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant has not shown that any error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error, i.e., that it was a harmful error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)].</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no due process error with the deciding official's actions. Rather, these facts are similar to <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 11 (2014), in which the appellant raised certain allegations in her response to the proposed removal and the deciding official rejected those allegations in the course of rendering his decision. Under such circumstances, the Board explained that a deciding official does not violate an employee's right to due process when he considers issues raised by the appellant in her response to the proposed adverse action and then rejects those arguments in reaching a decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12; <span class="Italic">see Blank</span>, 247 F.3d at 1229; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(g)(1) (in rendering a decision on a proposed adverse action, the agency will consider the reasons specified in the notice and any answer of the employee or her representative, or both, made to a designated official). In reaching this conclusion, the Board explained that an employee is not entitled to know the particular weight the deciding official will attach to her arguments raised in response to the proposed adverse action in advance of the final decision. <span class="Italic">See Wilson</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">cf. Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 Fed. Appx. 920, 925-26 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (the appellant was "not deprived of due process by not being advised in advance that the deciding official might draw [an] inference from the nature of the charged conduct"). Thus, consistent with <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, we find that the deciding official did not commit a due process violation when he considered and rejected the arguments the appellant raised in her reply to the notice of proposed removal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decision on the impact of raising an issue at the reply, and the deciding official's consideration of that matter, can be unclear. Consider this passage from <span class="Italic">Kilpatrick v. VA</span>, CB-7121-13-0181-V-1 n.3 (NP 5/8/2014), unclear on whether the Board was conducting a constitutional due process analysis or a somewhat diluted harmful error analysis (considering that under the Board's definition at 5 CFR 1201.4(r) (2022), harmful error is "Error by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error."):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the union raised the prior incident in the appellant's oral presentation to the deciding official. However, nothing in the deciding official's notes from the presentation indicate that she informed the appellant that she intended to consider the incident as a factor in her removal decision. As noted by the arbitrator, the deciding official should have considered the appellant's lack of any formal discipline as a mitigating factor in her penalty analysis. Finally, the agency's policy requires the deciding official only to consider information in the notice of proposed discipline. Therefore, the appellant has shown that the agency may have reached a different conclusion without consideration of the incident, distinguishing this appeal from <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-24 (2003) (finding that notice provided in a decision letter met the minimum requirements of due process where the appellant thereafter had an opportunity to present his side of the story in the grievance process prior to the effective date of his removal and also finding that the appellant failed to show harmful error).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kent v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> AT-0752-10-0652-I-1 (NP 9/19/2011), presented the interesting situation of when the proposing and deciding official are the same person--how is the decisional process isolated from knowledge the deciding official has about the appellant that is extraneous to the proposal? The Board decided the record needed more development and returned the appeal to the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The initial decision preceded <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> which reaffirmed and expanded <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, (Fed. Cir. 1999). <span class="Italic">Ward</span> also emphasized that a showing of harm is not required when an agency violates an appellant's due process rights in connection with either its merits determination or its penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1278-80. In addition, the appellant and his counsel were able to discover the potential due process issue only during the hearing, and they therefore had only the most limited opportunity to attempt to develop the claim below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Due Process Clause requires that, before being removed from federal employment, an employee must be afforded notice of the charges and the agency's evidence and be given an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279-80. An <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official during the employee's removal proceeding, relevant to the proceeding, may constitute a due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011) (there is no basis for distinguishing between <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information provided to the deciding official and information personally known by the deciding official, if the information was considered in reaching the decision and not disclosed to the appellant). Not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication rises to the level of a due process violation--only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279 (the question is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances). The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2001). A due process violation is not subject to the harmful error test; instead, the employee is automatically entitled to a new removal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is inadequately developed to allow us to ascertain whether any actual due process violations occurred. It is unclear precisely what evidence the appellant received or failed to receive regarding his removal, as the administrative judge made no findings regarding this issue. The record does not resolve the matter either--the agency's file does not suggest that the appellant received the underlying documents, the deciding official testified that she believed that she provided (directly or indirectly through Human Resources) the documents that the appellant and his union representative had requested (but she could not identify what documents were provided), and the appellant testified that he unsuccessfully attempted to obtain all the documents (personally and through the union) but did receive some limited materials. So the most basic question--were the written materials the agency relied upon in the disciplinary proceeding provided to the appellant--remains unanswered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further complicating matters, the deciding official was also the proposing official, and in this latter capacity, investigated the reported wrongdoing by speaking with the various witnesses (including the auditor and the appellant's supervisor) and requesting statements. The supervisor's and auditor's statements, in addition to discussing the charged conduct, also generally referred to <span class="Italic">other misconduct</span> by the appellant (<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., this was not the first time he engaged in improper conduct). The deciding official's testimony also suggested that she may have discussed <span class="Italic">other misconduct</span> with the auditor and supervisor--she noted that the supervisor appeared to have become used to the appellant's disrespectful attitude and that the auditor had characterized her incident as more severe than the "typical" appellant blow-up. On the current record, we cannot determine whether these statements about other misconduct referred to matters from the appellant's formal disciplinary record, or whether the statements provided <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information to the deciding official about the appellant's other (undisclosed) bad acts. Lastly, the deciding official testified that she had witnessed the appellant engaging in other unspecified misconduct, and it is unclear whether she considered this other misconduct in reaching her penalty decision. All these unanswered questions are significant in light of the deciding official's repeated testimony that the continuing nature of the appellant's misconduct weighed heavily in her decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kilpatrick v. VA</span>, CB-7121-13-0181-V-1 (NP 5/8/2014) ("The record here indicates that the deciding official, most likely as a result of her role as the appellant's third-level supervisor, was personally aware of the appellant's prior security incident. Nevertheless, we discern, and the Federal Circuit has suggested, no basis on which to distinguish <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications introducing new and material information not included in the notice of proposed removal that was previously unknown by the deciding official from material information related to an employee's past record personally known and considered by the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10 (2011). When a deciding official considers either type of information, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a potential constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Extraneous information gathered by the deciding official about the indictment that formed the basis of the proposal against the appellant did not serve to reverse the action in <span class="Italic">Lavan v. VA,</span> DA-0752-11-0629-I-1 (NP 8/17/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the hearing, Ms. Specks testified that, in making her penalty determination, she relied on the appellant's federal court indictment, which is clearly referenced in the notice of proposed indefinite suspension. Ms. Specks also mentioned that, upon reading the appellant's name in the news, she talked to the appellant's supervisor about the appellant's indictment. Ms. Specks further stated that she consulted with her Chief of Police regarding the same matter. Ms. Specks did not testify that she engaged in any conversations regarding other acts of alleged misconduct by the appellant, but rather she discussed the appellant's indictment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the indictment was the basis of the agency action, the information contained in these conversations was not new. The appellant had an opportunity to make an informed reply to that allegation, which Ms. Specks considered in making her decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant has failed to establish that the agency violated her due process rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Chambers v. VA</span>, AT-0752-12-0212-I-1 (NP 1/24/2014), information gathered by the deciding official was cumulative or immaterial, not grounds for reversing a removal based on misuse of a government vehicle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge misapplied <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), and failed to apply a harmful error analysis in assessing the impact of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that the deciding official had with two subordinates. The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications concerned three issues: (1) Which of the agency's numerous government-owned vehicles (GOV) <span id="Page_3278"></span>the appellant was driving when she committed her misconduct; (2) the nature of the appellant's duties; and (3) the fact that the appellant had completed an agency rehabilitation program as a client before becoming an agency employee. We find that the administrative judge correctly found that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011), our reviewing court held that, if an employee has not been given "notice of any aggravating factors supporting an enhanced penalty," an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the deciding official regarding such factors may constitute a due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). Only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information will violate the due process guarantee of notice. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6. The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces cumulative information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 7. Ultimately, the inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here has failed to show that any of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications contained new and material information that was so likely to prejudice the appellant's rights as to render the removal action unfair under the circumstances. The fact that the appellant committed her admitted misconduct in one particular government-owned vehicle as opposed to one of a number of others in the agency's fleet is in no way material in this case and therefore does not meet the materiality requirement of <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Similarly, the nature of the appellant's job duties is not new and material information but rather, more in the nature of background information already known to the appellant and was not the type of information that likely resulted in any undue pressure on the deciding official. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Moreover, the information about the appellant's prior participation in an agency rehabilitation program is not new information because the appellant raised it as an issue in her reply to the notice of proposed removal. Because she explicitly put the issue before the deciding official, she cannot claim that she did not know that the deciding official might consider it. Therefore, this information is not new and material under <span class="Italic">Stone</span> and the agency did not violate the appellant's right to due process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to show that the deciding official's consideration of these <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications constituted harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1282-83. To show harmful error, the appellant must prove that the procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991).

<p class="Body-Text">Consideration by the deciding official of the appellant's conduct as a threat, when the charge was conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service, was not cause to set aside the case for lack of due process when the proposal made repeated reference to the agency policy prohibiting threats, <span class="Italic">Hicks v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-16-0105-I-1 (NP 9/22/2016) ("Although the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat, the penalty section of the proposal notice quoted agency policies regarding firearms and workplace violence, which prohibited threats, and addressed the same type of alleged misconduct that formed the basis for the appellant's removal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Knowledge by the deciding official of extraneous information not included in the proposal will not cause reversal of the action if the information known is not relied on, as the court noted in its review of an arbitrator's award in <span class="Italic">Norris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As Norris's counsel conceded at oral argument, a deciding official's mere knowledge of prior misconduct by the employee obtained before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings does not constitute an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. There is nothing inherently wrong with a deciding official's having background knowledge of an employee's prior work history or performance record. Nothing in the regulations limits the deciding official to being a neutral arbiter or requires that the deciding official be unfamiliar with the individual, the facts of the case, or the employee's prior conduct. A deciding official's knowledge of an employee's background only raises due process or procedural concerns where that knowledge is a basis for the deciding official's determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, viewing the record as a whole, it is clear that Romero testified only to her <span class="Italic">knowledge</span> of the prior incident. She did not, as Norris contends, testify that this incident played any role in her decision to impose removal. She simply testified that this conduct has an impact on how an attorney is able to perform his duties. She also testified that, in deciding to remove Norris, she had not considered information that had not been included in the notice of proposed removal. Thus, unlike <span class="Italic">Ward</span> where the deciding official explicitly admitted to considering information not included in the notice of proposed removal in weighing two of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, here Romero never indicated that her knowledge of Norris's prior misconduct had influenced her consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors or weighed on her ultimate decision to remove Norris. We conclude that there is no evidence that Romero improperly considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in determining the penalty to be imposed.</p>

He reasserts that the deciding official: had a conversation with agency counsel concerning the removal action; was involved in the investigation of allegations against the appellant; and considered information contained in his official personnel file (OPF).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not all <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications rise to the level of due process violations; rather, only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications which introduce new and material information to the deciding official are constitutionally infirm. <span class="Italic">Lange v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the remand initial decision reflects that the administrative judge considered the record evidence as a whole and ultimately afforded significant weight to the deciding official's testimony that: he was not actively involved in any investigation of the appellant and had no recollection of any investigation involving the appellant; his review of the appellant's OPF to get a "better flavor of the whole employee" did not place undue pressure on him to rule in a certain manner; and he decided to remove the appellant solely based upon the appellant's performance issues. Where, as here, there is no evidence that, in deciding to remove the appellant, the deciding official relied upon his past involvement in, or knowledge of, an investigation into the appellant's prior actions or that he relied on information contained in the appellant's OPF, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that there is no due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1353-54 ("[A] deciding official's mere knowledge of prior misconduct by the employee obtained before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings does not constitute an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's mere disagreement with the administrative judge's fact finding and bare assertion that the administrative judge ignored and/or changed the facts is insufficient to demonstrate that the administrative judge made erroneous findings of material fact or erroneously applied the law to the facts. Further, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has not met his burden of showing that the deciding official's conversation with agency counsel introduced new and material evidence to the deciding official, or that the information provided undue <span id="Page_3279"></span>pressure on the deciding official to rule in a certain manner to support his due process claim. Additionally, the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that he failed to prove that, but for the deciding official's consideration of the aforementioned <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, the deciding official would not have removed him based on performance issues. Thus, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's explained findings, which are supported by the record evidence and the applicable law. <span class="Italic">See Crosby</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 106.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the inclusion of the appellant's past discipline on the deciding official's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet provided additional support for her reversal of the appellant's removal. We believe that this potential due process violation is underdeveloped, and should be explored further on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge noted that the appellant's prior discipline was included on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet but was not included in the agency's removal proposal or letter of decision. The administrative judge explained that although the deciding official testified that "he did not find the fact that the appellant had this prior discipline to be an aggravating factor," he also "acknowledged that he considered the factors listed in his written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis" before rendering his penalty determination. (agency letter of decision stating, "I have also taken into consideration all pertinent <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Factors[,] including your claims of mitigating circumstances.").

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the current record, we believe there remains an unresolved issue of fact as to whether the deciding official actually relied upon the appellant's past discipline in rendering his penalty analysis. As noted above, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, a deciding official's mere knowledge of information not included in a proposal notice is not enough to trigger a due process violation. <span class="Italic">Norris</span>, 675 F.3d at 1354. Rather, such information must be a "basis for the deciding official's determinations on either the merits of the underlying charge or the penalty to be imposed" before due process is violated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280). Many of the Board's post-<span class="Italic">Ward</span> decisions finding due process violations note that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information considered by the deciding officials also served as the grounds for their decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Solis</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 458, &#x00B6; 9 (noting that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors referred to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information, which "contributed in part to [the deciding official's] finding that the appellant had no potential for rehabilitation"); <span class="Italic">Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (referencing that the deciding official included <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information concerning prior discipline as factors in her decision letter); <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 12 (explaining that the deciding official's hearing testimony confirmed his consideration of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information about prior misconduct found on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet); <span class="Italic">Pickett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (highlighting that the deciding official "testified that he considered information he received" outside the proposal notice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In similar cases, where there has been a factual question as to whether the deciding official relied upon <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in rendering his ultimate decision, we have remanded that issue to the administrative judge for further factual development of the record. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

On remand, the administrative judge should explore whether the deciding official relied upon the appellant's past discipline when conducting his penalty analysis. The administrative judge, as the hearing officer, is in the best position to make factual findings and detailed credibility assessments. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. at 458.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, should the administrative judge conclude that the deciding official did not impermissibly consider the appellant's past discipline in violation of due process, the administrative judge should then assess whether the inclusion of the appellant's past discipline on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors worksheet amounted to harmful procedural error, <span class="Italic">War</span>d, 634 F.3d at 1281-82, and if not, then adjudicate the reasonableness of the appellant's removal under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cousin v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-13-0261-I-2 (NP 7/24/2015) ("Regarding the raw MMPI-2 data and Dr. Frederick's interpretation of that data, there is no evidence that the deciding official himself ever received these documents or considered them as part of his decision. Rather, it appears that the MMPI-2 data and Dr. Frederick's interpretation of that data never left the possession of Dr. Blanks, who used this information to write his report. The appellant has not demonstrated that due process requires him to be privy not only to the information that the deciding official relied upon in making his decision, but also to the data that went into formulating that information. In any event, the record contains no evidence that the appellant ever requested these documents either before or after his removal. Therefore, we find that the agency did not violate the appellant's due process rights. <span class="Italic">See McNab</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (finding no due process violation or harmful error because the appellant did not request the materials underlying his removal).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The information pertinent to the <span class="Italic">Ward</span> analysis is the information provided to the deciding official on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis during the reply process. The constitutional error is not avoided if the same information is disclosed to the appellant during Board discovery processes. <span class="Italic">See Rosario-Fabregas v. Dept. of Army,</span> NY-0752-10-0127-I-1 (NP 11/30/2011) ("That the documents may have been produced during the discovery process at the Board, however, is irrelevant to the issue of whether the appellant received them during the agency proceeding."). Nor is the error avoided because the appellant knew of the information relied on by the deciding official. The question is whether the appellant was on notice through the proposal that the information would be evaluated in setting a penalty, as <span class="Italic">Carder v. DOD,</span> DA-0752-14-0620-I-1 (NP 4/13/2015), involving the deciding official's reliance on some concerns about appellant's leave and attendance, demonstrates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the proposal to removal the appellant, nor the subsequent decision to suspend her, contained any mention of her being on leave restriction; leave-related concerns; or an absence without leave charge. In terms of past discipline, both letters indicated that the appellant had none. In terms of her past work record, length of service, and performance, both simply noted that the appellant had 5 years of prior service and her most recent performance rating was "fully successful." Nevertheless, the deciding official expressly testified that he considered her attendance in his "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis." He explained that he considered the appellant's attendance in terms of her past discipline as well as her past work record, length of service, and performance. The administrative judge asked what the deciding official was thinking as he considered the appellant's attendance in terms of past discipline, to which the deciding official indicated that the appellant was on a leave restriction letter. The administrative judge also asked why this was not included in his decision letter if it was considered an aggravating factor, to which the deciding official simply replied that he did not know. Accordingly, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's purported leave issues were used as an aggravating factor in the penalty determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency next suggests that the deciding official had personal knowledge of the appellant's past attendance issues, and that this somehow distinguishes the present case from those where another party introduced new information to the deciding official. However, the distinction the agency is relying on is one that the Board has not accepted. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 10. When a deciding official considers information not included in the proposed adverse action, regardless of whether that information was personally known to the deciding official or introduced by another party, the employee is no longer on notice of portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency in imposing the penalty, resulting in a potential constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency argues that information about the appellant's purported attendance issues did not result in a due process violation because it was neither new nor material. The agency asserts that the information about her attendance was not new because her absences occurred in the past, prior to the suspension at hand. The agency also <span id="Page_3280"></span>suggests that the appellant admitted having attendance problems and that there is no reason to believe the deciding official would have reached a different result in the absence of this information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not every <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication rises to the level of a due process violation; only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and material information to the deciding official constitute due process violations. <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board will consider the following factors, among others, to determine whether an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contact is constitutionally impermissible: (1) "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication merely introduces cumulative information or new information"; (2) "whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it"; and (3) "whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications were of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377. Ultimately, the question is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances." [2] <span class="Italic">Ward,</span> 634 F.3d at 1279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 256 (2000), for an alternate standard is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Powers</span> did note that the Board considers evidence to be material to a proceeding only where it is of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome. <span class="Italic">Powers</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 12. However, <span class="Italic">Powers</span> also noted that the ultimate inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377). Subsequent precedent from our reviewing court has clearly established that a due process violation is not subject to harmless error. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the fact that the appellant's purported attendance issues occurred at some point in the past, prior to the proposed discipline at hand, is not dispositive. The information was still new, regardless of the date of occurrence, based upon the lack of notice to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (finding that the appellant's prior discipline was new because the agency failed to include the information in its notice of proposed removal or elsewhere in the case file provided to the appellant). In addition, because the attendance issues were unrelated to anything contained in the record, it cannot be dismissed as cumulative. <span class="Italic">Cf. Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1229-30 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (finding that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications did not introduce new and material information in violation of due process where it merely confirmed and clarified that which was already contained in the record).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the appellant certainly had personal knowledge of her own attendance, but she lacked the knowledge that the deciding official would be considering it as aggravating. Her testimony before the administrative judge, acknowledging that she had taken a fair amount of leave for medical issues, is of no consequence. The relevant inquiry is whether the appellant knew of the information and had the opportunity to respond before the deciding official considered it. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377. Because the agency failed to provide the appellant notice that her attendance would be considered an aggravating factor in its penalty analysis, she was unable to explain her leave to the deciding official or otherwise argue that it should not be considered aggravating for this unrelated misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 11 (finding that even though the appellant was clearly aware of his own prior suspension, the agency's failure to advise him that it would be considered in his proposed removal deprived him of the opportunity to respond to it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the third <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor, the deciding official's testimony establishes that he considered the appellant's purported attendance issues as aggravating in his penalty analysis. <span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communication is plainly material when the deciding official has admitted that the information influenced his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). To the extent that the agency implies that the deciding official may have imposed the same penalty even in the absence of the new information, we are not persuaded, <span class="Italic">see Kolenc v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 22 (2013) (when the first <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factor "strongly suggests" a due process violation, "any deficiency of the third factor is less significant") (quoting <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2013)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the above, we find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's purported attendance issues rose to the level of a due process violation. That violation cannot be excused as harmless. <span class="Italic">See Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 13. Instead, the suspension must be reversed and this matter remanded to the agency to afford the appellant constitutionally-correct procedures. <span class="Italic">See Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tissychy v. DHHS,</span> DA-0752-11-0001-I-1 (NP 1/20/2012), noted a potential due process violation concerning a penalty determination. It appeared that drafts of the decision letter and internal communications between the deciding official and employees in the personnel office suggested that the deciding official at some point considered some past discipline but testified that it was not relied upon in the final decision. The AJ cut off questioning and denied a motion to compel discovery on the due process issue. The case was remanded to permit discovery and further adjudication. Following remand and another PFR, the Board found no due process error in <span class="Italic">Tissychy v. DHHS</span>, DA-0752-11-0001-B-1 (NP 6/7/2013), as to information not relied upon or cited by the agency deciding official or in the decision documents:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we do not agree that it resulted in undue pressure upon the deciding official to remove the appellant because no evidence of such exists in the record. On the contrary, the deciding official specifically testified that knowledge that the appellant had had prior discipline did not influence her decision at all; that the appellant's past problems did not matter and were unrelated to the charged misconduct which was serious enough to warrant removal; that she gave no thought to the appellant's prior discipline; and that it was meaningless to her. We have considered the language in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> suggesting that the undue pressure factor is not critical to a finding of denial of due process. The court recognized that "the lack of such undue pressure may be less relevant to determining when the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications deprived the employee of due process where...the [d]eciding official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications influenced his penalty determination," making the "materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications...self-evidence from the [d]eciding official's admission." <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1280 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 12 (2012) (the deciding official's admitted reliance on an offense in the agency's table of penalties different and more serious than the offense charged in the notice of proposed removal cannot be deemed immaterial to his decision); <span class="Italic">Howard v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (where the deciding official admitted that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication concerning the appellant's performance and productivity problems influenced his penalty determination, the information is clearly material); <span class="Italic">Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (the deciding official's specific identification of the five memoranda as factors in her decision shows that they were material to her decision); <span class="Italic">Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (while no clear evidence of undue pressure exists in the record, the deciding official's consistent statements in his testimony and written statement on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are clear evidence of the materiality of the appellant's past disciplinary record and alleged past instances of misconduct in the deciding official's decision to remove the appellant); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 11 (2011) (while there is no clear evidence of undue pressure, the materiality of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications is self-evident from the deciding official's admission that he considered the appellant's eligibility to maintain a sensitive position in deciding to remove him).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, not only is there a clear absence in the record of statements by the deciding official that she considered the appellant's prior discipline, but, as noted, there is her sworn testimony that she did not. Moreover, the administrative judge who heard the deciding official's testimony found it credible, finding that she testified in a direct and straightforward manner and that her testimony was consistent on cross and direct examination. The Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). In the absence of a sufficiently sound reason for overturning the administrative judge's credibility determination, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that the deciding official was unduly influenced by the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication. Despite the presence of the first two <span class="Italic">Stone</span> factors, we do not find that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication in this case was "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice" that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that there has been no violation of the appellant's due process rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3281"></span>However, the fact that the underlying information is known to the appellant does not determine whether it is cumulative. <span class="Italic">See Lopes v.

Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 11 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the agency provided the appellant with the performance data it relied upon in taking the removal action in the notice of proposed removal. The deciding official's communication with the proposing official regarding this data introduced cumulative information because it merely clarified how the appellant's performance data was derived. As to the deciding official's communication with the LTRO Manager, the appellant has not provided a basis for disturbing the administrative judge's finding that this communication did not introduce new information. In particular, there is no basis to conclude that the LTRO Manager did anything other than confirm information that had already been provided to the appellant in the notice of proposed removal. Accordingly, the deciding official's communications with the proposing official and with the LTRO Manager do not present a constitutional due process violation. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-16-0128-I-1 (NP 11/22/2022), determined that information obtained by the deciding official was confirmatory and not a due process violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The information from the HR Chief and the OGC that the deciding official received in response to his question as to whether there were any alternatives to the appellant's removal, given that his tour was due to end, not having been extended, and that he had received a valid job offer under the PPP to which he had failed to respond, was that there were no alternatives. This information regarding the implications of the appellant's action or inaction was not new, but rather cumulative, because it was explained to him in the various notices he received from the agency, including the proposal notice, and because it was part of the DOD AI and DODEA AI, agency orders to which the appellant was subjected during his lengthy tour in Japan and of which he was aware. Moreover, the information did not result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner; rather, it confirmed that, under the particular circumstances presented, he had no choice but to uphold the proposed action. We find, therefore, that the appellant has not shown that the administrative judge erred in rejecting as unsupported the appellant's claim that the agency denied him due process.</p>

The record reflects that the Chief of Personnel Security's reconsideration decision merely reaffirmed the prior decision to revoke the appellant's eligibility to obtain access to NSI and that it did not rely upon any new bases or grounds for revoking the appellant's eligibility to which she did not have an opportunity to respond.

<p class="Body-Text">Conclusions or inferences drawn by a deciding official, rather than new factual information relied on by that official, did not warrant setting aside discipline for due process reasons, <span class="Italic">Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 Fed. Appx. 920, 925-26 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harding's third due process claim is that her removal was improperly based on several aggravating penalty factors of which she was not given notice. The factors about which she complains are: (1) that she acted with intent; (2) that her removal was consistent with discipline in other similar cases; and (3) that she had operated her car while in an impaired state, thus endangering residents of the NSA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to intent, there has never been any dispute that Ms. Harding acted intentionally in using cocaine and in driving her vehicle onto the NSA grounds while in an impaired state. The deciding official's reliance on that factor could not reasonably have come as a surprise to Ms. Harding, given that there was essentially no dispute over the underlying facts that led to her removal. Indeed, in her response to the notice of proposed removal, she effectively admitted that she had driven onto the NSA facility intentionally, i.e., with the purpose of retrieving a key for the banquet room she intended to use that night.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the deciding official's reference to the discipline imposed in similar cases, the major focus of that portion of the notice of decision was on the prescribed range of penalties for off-duty drug use, which included removal, and Executive Order No. 12564, which prohibits drug use by federal employees, whether on or off duty. The deciding official explained that the reference to penalties "imposed upon other employees with similar misconduct" related to a case decided by a different deciding official several years earlier. The deciding official testified that he typically inquired about other similar cases because, "from a consistency standpoint in terms of process it's good to reference." But he added that the information about the one similar case that he learned of was not material to his decision. Moreover, the fact of consistency with other decisions was not used as an aggravating factor, and thus due process would not require that the employee be given advance notice of the deciding official's intent to consider the penalties imposed on others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Harding argues that she was improperly denied notice that the deciding official would rely on the danger that Ms. Harding's conduct presented to persons living in the part of the NSA facility where she had been driving, which was a residential area. The act of driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, however, is inherently dangerous. The deciding official was merely pointing out that Ms. Harding's conduct presented a danger to persons in the NSA, a conclusion that flowed naturally from the fact of impaired driving in a residential area. She was not deprived of due process by not being advised in advance that the deciding official might draw that inference from the nature of the charged conduct.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Ms. Harding relies on this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011), and <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), to support her claim that she was denied due process by not being notified of the penalty-related factors listed above. Those cases are inapposite, as they both involved <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts with the deciding official in which information was conveyed to the decisionmaker without the employee's knowledge. In <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication conveyed information about several past instances of misconduct by the employee, which the deciding official took into account in deciding that removal was warranted. 634 F.3d at 1278. The past misconduct in <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, unlike the factors raised by Ms. Harding, was clearly an aggravating factor as to which the employee had no notice. In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication included the recommendation of another agency official that the employee be removed. 179 F.3d at 1372. The court remanded in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> to determine whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication introduced new and material information to the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1377.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective November 20, 2009, the agency removed the appellant based on three charges of misconduct: (1) misuse of her government telephone; (2) misuse of her government laptop computer; and (3) misuse of her government desktop computer. In support of its first charge, the agency asserted that, between March 27, 2009, and June 30, 2009, the appellant made 368 calls, totaling 18.7 hours, from her government office telephone that were not related to agency business. In support of its second charge, the agency asserted that, between March 27, 2009, and June 30, 2009, the appellant used her government laptop computer to access at least 113 web sites that were not related to her assigned duties. In support of its third charge, the agency brought ten specifications, five of which alleged that on specific dates the appellant used her government desktop computer to access between 62 and 300 web sites not related to the appellant's official duties. The remaining five specifications alleged that on three dates the appellant used her government desktop computer to utilize her administrative privileges to access numerous documents not related to her assigned duties, that she utilized her administrative privileges to load 43 programs, and that she sent at least 16 e-mails that were not related to her assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding the hearing requested by the appellant, the administrative judge found in a March 25, 2010 initial decision that the agency established the sole specification under the first charge, failed to establish the sole specification under the second charge, and established seven of the ten specifications under the third charge. The administrative judge also found that the agency established a nexus between the sustained <span id="Page_3282"></span>misconduct and the efficiency of the service and that the penalty of removal was reasonable.</p>

Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-13 (2011).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective March 2, 2012, the agency removed the appellant a second time based on misuse of her government telephone and misuse of her government desktop computer. In support of the misuse of her government telephone charge, the agency again asserted that, between March 27, 2009, and June 30, 2009, the appellant made 368 calls, totaling 18.7 hours, from her government office telephone that were not related to agency business. Regarding the misuse of her government desktop computer charge, the agency brought seven specifications, which were essentially the same specifications asserted in the agency's November 20, 2009 removal action and sustained by the administrative judge in the initial decision in the appeal of that removal. The appellant has filed an appeal of the March 2, 2012 removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a June 4, 2012 order, the administrative judge explained that he held a status conference with the parties to discuss the issues to be adjudicated in the instant case in light of the Board's reversal of the prior removal action pursuant to the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Ward</span> decision. The administrative judge ruled that he would schedule a hearing "which will address only the agency's penalty selection and the appellant's affirmative defenses," and that he would not "relitigate the charges...as the identical charges were previously sustained in [his March 25, 2010 initial decision] and [his] findings with respect to those charges were left undisturbed by the Board's" June 17, 2011 decision. (emphasis in original). The administrative judge concluded that he did not believe that limiting the scope of the hearing would deny the appellant due process and that it would serve the interests of judicial economy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then moved for the administrative judge to certify as an interlocutory appeal the issue of whether the appellant is entitled to a "new full hearing on the merits of her removal." In an August 2, 2012 order, the administrative judge granted the appellant's motion and certified his June 4, 2012 ruling set forth above as an interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented by the administrative judge's certified ruling is whether, when the Board reverses an agency's removal action on procedural grounds, an administrative judge may limit the hearing in an appeal of a second removal action based on the same charges that were previously sustained by the administrative judge, so as to not rehear the merits of the agency's charges. We start by noting that, contrary to the administrative judge's assertion, his findings in the March 25, 2010 initial decision regarding the charges were not "left undisturbed by the Board's" June 17, 2011 decision. Rather, the Board's decision reversed the initial decision, and the Board stated that it was not making a finding with respect to the agency's charges. <span class="Italic">Lopes</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 14 n.4. Because the Board explicitly made no finding regarding the merits of the agency's charges and there has not been a final decision regarding those charges, we find that the administrative judge cannot rely on his previous initial decision as a basis for findings in the instant case.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that the concepts of claim preclusion and issue preclusion are not applicable here because the Board's June 17, 2011 decision reversed the initial decision, specifically did not address the merits of the agency's charges, and does not constitute a final decision on the merits of the agency's charges. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2012 MSPB 118, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). Similarly, the law of the case doctrine is not applicable here because the instant matter is a separate and distinct appeal from the appellant's first case. <span class="Italic">See Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2012 MSPB 126, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board and its administrative judges routinely incorporate the record from one matter filed by an appellant into the record in a second matter filed by the same appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schneider v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 12 n.1 (2005) (incorporating a list of disclosures submitted into the record in one individual right of action appeal into the record in another appeal); <span class="Italic">Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 16 (2003) (explaining that the administrative judge stated that the record in the appeal before the administrative judge would be incorporated into the appellant's refiled appeal); <span class="Italic">Jeffery v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 151, 155-56 (1992) (remanding an appeal to the regional office to incorporate the record in a previous removal appeal into the record in a retirement appeal). The Board has even found that evidence from an appeal involving one appellant may be incorporated into the record in an appeal brought by another appellant. <span class="Italic">Strauss v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 132, 135-36 (1988). In addition, it is well settled that a Board administrative judge has broad discretion to control the course of the hearing before him, including the authority to exclude duplicative evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b); <span class="Italic">see Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2010); <span class="Italic">Sigler v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 103, 110 (1994); <span class="Italic">Franco v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above, we find that the administrative judge in the instant appeal--the same administrative judge who heard the hearing testimony in the appellant's first appeal--may, at his discretion, incorporate into the record in the case and bar any portions of the record from the previous appeal that he deems appropriate. Thus, for example, he may incorporate the hearing testimony of some or all of the witnesses.[5] While the administrative judge may incorporate testimony from the prior appeal into the record in this appeal, he must also afford the parties the opportunity to fully develop the record in this appeal, consistent with his authority to exclude irrelevant and duplicative testimony. Accordingly, while the administrative judge may incorporate hearing testimony from the first appeal into the record in this appeal, he must also allow the parties to further develop the record to the extent that it is relevant and nonduplicative of the evidence that is already in the record.[6] <span class="Italic">See Strauss</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 136 (although the incorporation of evidence from an appeal involving another individual is permissible, it may not serve as a basis for denying a party the opportunity to call and cross examine witnesses).</p>

Department of Transportation</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 11, 13 (1984), for the proposition that a hearing is an important right for a federal employee facing an adverse action and that the administrative judge's authority to control the proceedings must be balanced with the appellant's right to be heard. We agree with the appellant's assertion, but nothing in <span class="Italic">Webb</span> or <span class="Italic">Naekel</span> suggests that under the circumstances present here the administrative judge may not incorporate portions of the record from the appellant's first appeal into the record in her second appeal.</p>
