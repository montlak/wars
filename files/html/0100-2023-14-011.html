<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-12"><span class="space">b.</span> Assault; Threat</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Behavior that results in a clear threat to human life is so egregious that the adverse effect of the employee's retention on the efficiency of the service can be substantial. If the appellant can demonstrate the clear unlikelihood of his repeating the violent behavior charged and proved, the presumption of nexus can be rebutted. <span class="Italic">Broadnax v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 142, 156 (1982). <span class="Italic">Broadnax</span> determined, following remand, 24 MSPR 319, 323-24 (1984), that in noncriminal but violent off-duty conduct caused by a subsequently controlled medical condition, the presumption of nexus is rebutted by a demonstration that the conduct will not interfere with or adversely affect the job performance of the appellant or his coworkers and that it will not interfere with accomplishment of the agency mission. Under <span class="Italic">Broadnax,</span> the rebuttal may include medical reports or testimony and testimony of coworkers who disclaim fears of the appellant returning to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the suggestion in <span class="Italic">Backus v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 457, 461 (1984), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Broadnax</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that some apprehension by coworkers is enough to <span id="Page_2290"></span>demonstrate nexus, the Board makes it difficult to dispel that apprehension. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 521, 530 (1984), involved an indefinite suspension of the appellant, a clerk-typist, indicted for offenses that included rape and false imprisonment. The Board discounted testimony from some coworkers who said they would not be troubled by the appellant's return to the job because, the Board suggested, they did not fully comprehend the details and extent of the appellant's conduct. Perhaps the coworkers would have been required to sit through the criminal proceedings before they could have been knowledgeable enough of appellant's conduct to express their true and "informed" feelings about his return to work. The Board also determined that Johnson presented no evidence that his off-duty misconduct would not interfere with the agency mission. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 548, 550 (1986) (nexus between off-duty misconduct and indefinite suspension based on "testimony of agency employees who expressed reluctance to work with appellant while his criminal charges were pending").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit issued a decision suggesting a more traditional, rational, and less deferential view of nexus. In <span class="Italic">Stines v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-630), a supervisory correctional officer was threatened while off duty by a tavern owner. During the altercation, while sitting in a car, the appellant put a revolver onto the seat beside him, leading to a conviction based upon the misdemeanor of reckless handling or display of a deadly weapon. His removal followed. The court opined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that the misconduct of a federal employee while he is not on duty does not in itself serve as a basis for removal, and that the burden is on the agency to show that the misconduct affected the employee's performance on the job. <span class="Italic">Schlegel v. United States</span>, 416 F.2d 1372 (Ct. Cl. 1969); <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly held that the agency was obligated to demonstrate that the misconduct of petitioner affected his performance, and that there was a nexus between his conviction and the efficiency of the service....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Young v. Hampton</span>, 568 F.2d 1253 (7th Cir. 1977), the Board held that a nexus may be inferred when two conditions are present:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1. The misconduct must be egregious and of such a nature that its effect on the efficiency of the service can reasonably be deemed to be substantial; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2. Sufficient evidence has not been introduced to rebut the presumption of substantial impact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the administrative judge found both that the petitioner acted without premeditation and that the offense supporting his guilty plea was a misdemeanor, not regarded as a serious offense under state law. In view of the nature of the offense, petitioner's conduct was not egregious and there was no presumption of a nexus between his conduct and the efficiency of the service. Therefore, the burden was upon the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a nexus was present. The evidence the agency presented on the issue was a newspaper article stating that petitioner was charged with aggravated assault after he "allegedly waved a gun around and at bartender Frank Lee. The gun was not fired and no one was injured." Petitioner was convicted of a misdemeanor rather than an aggravated assault, and we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the newspaper story, on its face, was not sufficient to show a nexus in view of petitioner's service record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only other evidence offered by the agency was the affidavit of the superintendent of the prison camp, who removed petitioner from the service. He stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Stines by his deliberate actions destroyed his credibility as a correctional worker and demonstrated that he was not one to whom the care, custody and correction of Federal criminal offenders could be entrusted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that this affidavit amounted to nothing more than an argument or opinion that a nexus existed between petitioner's conduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the Board did not disagree with the presiding official's findings of fact. However, the Board reversed the decision of the administrative judge and held that the opinion of the superintendent was sufficient to establish the required nexus. The Board also concluded that the administrative judge erroneously held that the newspaper article was "scanty evidence" of nexus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if it is assumed <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the newspaper article and the superintendent's affidavit can be considered as some evidence of nexus, that evidence was rebutted by petitioner's employment service record....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon a careful review of the whole record, we conclude that the Board erred as a matter of law in holding that the agency had established a nexus between petitioner's conduct and the efficiency of the service. The Board's decision, which was based almost entirely on the argumentative, unsupported affidavit of the superintendent, is inconsistent with its own decision in <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 6 MSPB 493, 510 (1981). Among other things, the Board there held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In most cases, even of clearly criminal conduct, the establishment of nexus need not and should not depend upon mere assertion or speculation. In all cases it is the agency's burden to establish that the misconduct affects the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit concluded that an assault by an employee on his supervisor, while off duty, warranted a finding of nexus and justified removal, <span class="Italic">Dominguez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 803 F.2d 680, 683 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are persuaded by respondent's argument that a brutal attack on one's supervisor has a chilling effect upon relationships between supervisors and employees which can adversely impact on the agency's ability to fulfill its assigned mission with proper efficiency. Fear of physical reprisal would become the order of the day if an employee could merely wait until after work to assault a supervisor with impunity....&#8197;There can be no "open season" on supervisors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Conduct during a dispute between the appellant and his wife sustained a finding of nexus and supported discharge when the appellant's supervisor said he lost confidence in the appellant to perform as a criminal investigator,<span class="Italic"> Gooch v. DHS,</span> AT-0752-14-0080-I-1 (NP 2/25/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding nexus between the battery charge and the efficiency of the service, we note this conduct occurred off-duty. An agency may show a nexus between off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service by three means: (1) a rebuttable presumption in certain egregious circumstances; (2) preponderant evidence that the misconduct adversely affects the appellant's or co-workers' job performance or the agency's trust and confidence in the appellant's job performance; or (3) preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Scheffler v. Department of Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 10 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 522 F. App'x 913 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Nexus may be proved by showing that an employee engaged in off-duty misconduct that is inconsistent with the agency's mission and undermines confidence in the employee. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2000). A deciding official's declaration that <span class="Italic">persuasively explains why he lost confidence and trust in an employee's job performance may satisfy the nexus requirement. See Ellis v. Department of Defense</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 407, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). The decision to remove the appellant states that his supervisors lost confidence in his ability to continue to function in his "trusted" position as a Criminal Investigator (Senior Special Agent) and that the appellant's acts of violence against his spouse are against the protective mission of the agency. The decision also states that the appellant's position requires that he act as a liaison with other law enforcement agencies. Because local law enforcement was involved in the appellant's off-duty misconduct, the misconduct could adversely affect the agency's reputation with local law enforcement. We find these circumstances along with the testimony of the deciding official referenced in the initial decision, to be sufficient to meet the agency's burden of establishing a nexus between the appellant's off-duty misconduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Long v. SSA</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (Judge Dyk, concurring) (sustaining removal of an administrative law judge for conduct involving an off-duty domestic altercation); <span class="Italic">Kinslow v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 286 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (sustaining removal of a supervisory tax examining technician who became involved in a serious off-duty physical altercation with his wife, also an agency employee, and who lied to the police about the nature of the altercation during their investigation); <span class="Italic">White v. USPS,</span> 176 Fed. Appx. 130, 132 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) ("We therefore agree with the Board's findings and reasoning that White's misconduct against his fellow employee, in front of many co-workers at a union-sanctioned event, had a chilling effect upon relationships at the workplace which can only adversely impact the agency's ability to fulfill its mission with proper efficiency."); <span class="Italic">Jeanquart v. VA</span>, CH-0752-14-0565-I-1 (NP 8/17/2022) ("We agree with the administrative judge that the violent and life-threatening nature of the appellant's misconduct in strangling, suffocating, hitting, kneeing, biting, and threatening to kill his ex-wife, an agency employee, was so egregious that a rebuttable presumption of nexus applies.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Justified by reasoning analogous to that applied to assault cases, nexus was established when a postmaster left the scene of an auto accident, leading to an emergency suspension and removal. There followed publicity and adverse letters from postal patrons (some anonymous). The letters, even those that were unsigned, were probative of nexus. The appellant was in a position of trust and was convicted of an offense impugning that trust and reliability. <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 452, 456 (1984). A reviewing court affirmed, <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 768 F.2d 334, 336 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although petitioner argues that the record fails to establish adverse community reaction resulting from petitioner's misconduct, the Board had before it ample record evidence of extensive adverse media coverage including television and newspaper reports as well as numerous telephone calls and letters from the public. An aggravating factor relied on by the Board is that petitioner occupied a position of responsibility within the Postal Service. As postmaster, he was the highest postal official in the community, interacted with postal customers, and occupied a position of trust and stature. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. United States Postal Service</span>, 647 F.2d 1093, 1098 (Ct. Cl. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 454 U.S. 1144 (1982).</p>
