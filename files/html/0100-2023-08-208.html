<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-206"><span class="space">d.</span> Disciplinary Reassignment; Unified Penalties; Reassignment Leading to Reduction in Pay</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a reassignment is not ordinarily appealable to the Board, it is subject to review if it is tied to an appealable suspension or demotion (reduction in grade or pay). The key is the combination of the otherwise nonappealable reassignment with the otherwise appealable action. If a reassignment or detail occurs at the same time an adverse action is proposed, there is no appeal from the switch in jobs if the adverse action proposal does not ripen into an adverse action decision<span class="Italic">. See Pann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 82 MSPR 294, 295 &#x00B6; 3 (1999); <span class="Italic">cf. Stewart v. DOD</span>, 82 MSPR 649, 655 &#x00B6; 15 (1999) (for the Board to have unified penalty jurisdiction over a 14-day suspension and a reassignment, the other action complained of, a reduction in pay, must be within the Board's jurisdiction). <span class="Italic">But see Lloyd v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-16-0247-I-1 (NP 8/2/2022) (indefinite suspension based on clearance suspension: "appellant asserts that the agency has favorably adjudicated his security clearance and that he was returned to paid status...that, as of the filing of his petition for review, the agency had not yet restored him to his previous position. To the extent the appellant is requesting the Board to order his reinstatement, such a request is outside the scope of our authority given he did not prevail in his appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ulep v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 4 (2014) (ordering the cancelation of the appellant's indefinite suspension and his retroactive restoration when he proved his harmful procedural error claim and the Board reversed the agency's action).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The development of the concept of unified penalties is briefly traced. After the Board initially rejected jurisdiction over a reassignment tied to an appealable adverse action in <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 23 MSPR 554, 556-57 (1984), the jurisdictional issue was reviewed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 779 F.2d 663, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Following allegations of failure to abide by agency regulations, the appellant was geographically reassigned and demoted. The court observed that the Board based its jurisdictional determination on agency assertions that the reassignment was based on management considerations independent of the basis for the demotion. The court decided, however, that the downgrading and reassignment constituted a unified penalty arising from the same circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that although the board has jurisdiction to review a reassignment that results in a reduction in grade, the board does not have jurisdiction to review a reassignment that accompanies or implements a reduction in grade. We do not consider this difference significant. The board has jurisdiction to review what is in both cases a unitary penalty. To hold otherwise would insulate from review a penalty that may clearly be excessive or unreasonable in view of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, by merely reversing the order of reduction in grade and reassignment. We discern no statutory intent to achieve this result, which is on its face unfair.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The MSPB has jurisdiction to review the entire adverse agency action and indeed must do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Board reduced the penalty to 15 days and directed the agency to cancel the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 31 MSPR 243, 246 (1986) ("Despite the agency's assertion that appellant's position is a prominent one and that his conduct embarrassed and discredited the agency, no evidence was offered in support of these contentions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may face difficulties when the Board reviews a reassignment tied to an adverse action. A supervisor was demoted for misconduct to a nonsupervisory job and geographically reassigned. The Board mitigated the penalty by sustaining the reassignment, canceling the demotion, and substituting a suspension for the demotion. The Board did not clarify what the agency was supposed to do with its newly relocated supervisor, i.e., take action to demote or reassign the supervisor who might otherwise have been in place in the location of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. DOJ</span>, 30 MSPR 652, 661 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_328"></span>Other forms of unified penalties are reviewed on appeal, e.g., in <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 241 (1993), a suspension, demotion, and a two-year exclusion from consideration for supervisory positions, and in <span class="Italic">Kirk v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 663, 672 (1993), a suspension, reassignment out of a supervisory position, and reassignment out of a particular agency program (although not simultaneous, all arising from the same incident of sexual harassment). The most common unified penalty is probably a suspension or demotion linked to geographical reassignment. The Board expanded its analysis of appealable disciplinary reassignments, <span class="Italic">Welch v. USDA</span>, 37 MSPR 18, 21-22 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reassignment actions are generally not appealable to the Board.... The Board, however, has jurisdiction to review a reassignment that accompanies or implements an appealable adverse action as a portion of the penalty imposed by an agency. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 779 F.2d 663, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">after remand</span>, 31 MSPR 243, 245-47 (1986). The Board has jurisdiction over such a reassignment even if it is not effected simultaneously with the appealable adverse action if the record shows that the adverse action and the reassignment constitute a "unified penalty arising out of the set of circumstances of which" the employee "was found culpable." <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 779 F.2d at 664-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he reassignment action was effected on March 13, 1987...based upon the recommendation of the...Personnel Division because of the appellant's alleged misconduct.... The Chief of the...Personnel Division was the deciding official who directed the appellant's sixty-day suspension, effective March 30, 1987.... ASCS testified that the appellant would be reinstated...in Monroeville...if the Board reversed the suspension action....

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Ostrout v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 586, 589 n.2 (1992) (reduction in grade and reassignment constituted a unitary action: reassignment was to accommodate the appellant's stress-related problems through a downgrade to a less stressful position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the record demonstrates that at least one of the reasons for the reassignment was the cause of the adverse action, the penalty is unified and within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Aliota v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 491, 495 (1994). A reassignment separated from a suspension by about two months constituted a unified penalty because "the deciding and proposing officials testified that it was the nature of the sustained charges that caused them to reassign the appellant and that they would not have reassigned him but for his misconduct." <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 425, 431 (1994) ("This holding has permitted the Board to order an agency to return an employee to his or her former position when the unified penalty of reassignment and an adverse action that does not rise to the level of a removal is not reasonable or warranted." The Board found no unified penalty, however, when the appellant was not reassigned but only temporarily assigned--essentially detailed--to another position while he retained his official position.); <span class="Italic">Christensen v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 689 (1991) ("the deciding and proposing officials testified that it was the nature of the sustained charges that caused them to reassign the appellant and that they would not have reassigned him but for this misconduct").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board determines that reasons independent of those supporting discipline motivated a reassignment, e.g., events intervening after a disciplinary decision was made, it is likely that the discipline and reassignment will be viewed as separate actions, leaving the reassignment unreviewable. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 525, 536-38 (1989). A reassignment or detail tied to a proposed removal that does not ripen into a removal decision (or resignation challenged as a constructive removal) remains an unappealable action. <span class="Italic">See Pann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 82 MSPR 294, 295-96 &#x00B6; 1 (1999) (remanding for determination of whether an appealable reduction in pay occurred when the appellant was shifted into a position that no longer carried "dive pay").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The law on unified penalties generally concerns whether a reassignment and adverse action are, well, unified. There is not been much Board discussion of the appropriateness of a reassignment once the basis for the adverse action is established. It is implied that should an agency impose a dual penalty for the same offense, e.g., a demotion and a suspension, the Board may examine the bases offered to support each penalty component. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233, 241 n.5 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 46, 53 (1994), the Board met a challenge to a geographical reassignment and demotion based on abusive language toward a coworker with the observation in footnote 2 of the decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency imposes an adverse action combined with a reassignment, the Board must consider the reasonableness of the combined penalty, despite the fact that the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over reassignment actions. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 779 F.2d 663, 665 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 455, 471 (1990). The deciding official testified that he believed that the appellant could no longer function effectively at FCI Big Spring because his presence would cause a disruption by "pull[ing] apart" the staff that had aligned themselves with the appellant from the staff that had aligned themselves with the coworker who was the target of the appellant's comments. In this regard, we note that five witnesses testified that they had heard the appellant make the charged comments, and that six witnesses testified that they had never heard the appellant make such comments. Despite the fact that the coworker who was the target of the appellant's comments was eventually transferred to another facility, we find that the appellant's reassignment was a reasonable part of the penalty, <span class="Italic">see Tamburello</span>, 45 MSPR at 471-72.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sexual harassment led the Board to sustain demotion and geographical reassignment, <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 455, 471-72 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's conduct in sexually harassing, threatening, and berating employees created an unpleasant and intimidating work environment for his subordinates. In fact, the record indicates that some of the witnesses against the appellant continued to be intimidated by him even after the agency had effected its action against him. Furthermore, as noted above, the appellant's immediate supervisor has lost confidence in his ability to perform his duties effectively. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant's reassignment was an appropriate part of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Ballentine,</span> 30 MSPR at 661.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency is required by the Board to cancel an adverse action, such as removal, and then, as part of or soon after the reinstatement process, the agency reassigns the employee, a challenge may be brought to the agency's restoration of the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">Before the Federal Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Brewer, supra</span>, an agency's listing of an adverse action and a reassignment together as penalties for misconduct did not establish Board jurisdiction over the agency's discretionary right to reassign employees. <span class="Italic">See Burkwist v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 26 MSPR 427, 429 n.3 (1985) (relying on <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 20 MSPR 524, 527 (1984) ("The agency merely took two actions at the same time, only one of which was subject to Board jurisdiction. The agency's listing of these actions together as penalties for the charges in its...notices does not establish jurisdiction over management's discretionary right to reassign appellant to another facility.")). Although an agency might list demotion and reassignment together as penalties in its table of penalties, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the reassignment; jurisdiction existed only if the reassignment resulted in a loss of grade or pay. <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 23 MSPR 554, 556 (1984), <span class="Italic">vacated</span>, 779 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Jacob v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 277, 279-80 (1984); <span class="Italic">Riley v. USDA</span>, 20 MSPR 32, 34 (1984). When a demotion was coupled with a geographical reassignment, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the reassignment if it was not the cause for the loss of grade or pay. <span class="Italic">Chappelle v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 352, 353 n.1 (1985). But <span class="Italic">Adams v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-16-0670-I-1 (NP 7/21/2022), explained that when a reassignment leads to an appealable pay reduction, the Board, with adequate factual support, has jurisdiction over the pay reduction and the reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this appeal present another jurisdictional issue regarding whether the appellant has been subjected to an involuntary reassignment that resulted in a reduction in pay or grade. Although the Board generally does not have jurisdiction over reassignments, the Board has jurisdiction over agency actions that result in a reduction in pay or grade. <span class="Italic">See McAlexander v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3)-(4). A reduction in pay or grade that an employee accepts voluntarily is not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">McAlexander</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 8; see 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(9). However, the Board has long recognized that employee-initiated actions that appear voluntary on their face are not always so. <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 7 (2013); <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 140, 142 (1980). For example, the Board has held that "[a]n employee-initiated action is considered involuntary if it resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements, or from the agency's failure to provide the employee with adequate information on which to make an informed choice." <span class="Italic">Pawlowski v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 10 (2004) (quoting <span class="Italic">Smitka v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 680, 689 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 605 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table)); <span class="Italic">see Goodwin v. Department of Transportation</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 15 (2007) (finding that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that her reassignment and resulting reduction in pay were involuntary when she asserted that she relied on the agency's misinformation regarding pay when deciding to accept the reassignment); <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of Transportation</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 10 (2005) (finding that the appellant's assertion that he accepted a position based on the agency's misinformation regarding the nature of the reassignment and its effect on his base pay constituted a nonfrivolous allegation that his reduction in pay was involuntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has argued throughout her appeal that her reassignment to the Physical Security Specialist position was involuntary based on her reliance on the agency's misinformation concerning her entitlement to retained pay in that position. The record shows that the agency informed the appellant in the offer letter that she would receive the same salary that she had been receiving in her Police Officer position.[4] Moreover, the appellant stated in her sworn declaration that she relied on the agency's misrepresentation that she would receive retained pay in the Physical Security Specialist position when she accepted the <span id="Page_329"></span>new position. We find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that her acceptance of the reassignment to the Physical Security Specialist position was involuntary, thereby entitling her to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency initially offered the appellant the Physical Security Specialist position at an annual salary of $57,713.00, which was her salary in the Police Officer position. The appellant requested that her reassignment be delayed for a brief period until after she received a periodic step increase, and the agency agreed. After she received the step increase, her annual salary in the Police Officer position increased to $60,277.00. She then was reassigned to the Physical Security Specialist position at the higher salary.</p>
