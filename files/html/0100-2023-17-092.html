<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-93"><span class="space">D.</span> REEMPLOYMENT RIGHTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations establish limited reemployment rights for those adversely affected by a RIF, 5 CFR Part 330 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.201 <span class="Italic">Purpose</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Reemployment Priority List (RPL) is a required component of an agency's placement programs to assist its current and former competitive service employees who will be or were separated by reduction in force (RIF) under part 351 of this chapter, or who have recovered from a compensable work-related injury after more than 1 year, as required by part 353 of this chapter. In filling vacancies, an agency must give its RPL registrants placement priority for most competitive service vacancies before hiring someone from outside its own permanent competitive service workforce. An agency may choose to consider RPL placement priority candidates before other agency permanent competitive service employees under its Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) established under subpart F of this part, after fulfilling agency obligations to its CTAP selection priority candidates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Agencies must use an RPL to give placement priority to their:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Current competitive service employees with a specific notice of RIF separation or a Certification of Expected Separation issued under part 351 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Former competitive service employees separated by RIF under part 351 of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Former competitive service employees fully recovered from a compensable injury (as defined in part 353 of this chapter) after more than 1 year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;All agency components within the local commuting area use a single RPL and are responsible for giving placement priority to the agency's RPL registrants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate placement program which satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart, including veterans' preference, as an exception to the RPL regulations under this subpart. This provision is limited to reemployment priority because of RIF separation and allows agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their programs and satisfy employee entitlements to reemployment priority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.202 <span class="Italic">Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this subpart:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Will not cause an undue interruption, as defined in &#x00A7; 351.203 of this chapter, that would prevent the completion of required work by the registrant 90 days after the registrant is placed in the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is physically qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the duties of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Meets any special OPM-approved qualifying conditions for the position; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Allow an RPL eligible to specify the conditions under which he or she will accept a position, including grades or pay levels, appointment type (permanent or time-limited), occupations (e.g., position classification series or career groups), and minimum number of hours of work per week, as applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.206 <span class="Italic">RPL registration timeframe and positions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;To register, an RPL eligible must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Meet the eligibility conditions under &#x00A7; 330.203(a) or (b);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Complete an RPL application prescribed by the current or former agency and keep the agency informed of any significant changes in the information provided; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Submit the RPL application on or before the RIF separation date or, if an RPL eligible under &#x00A7; 330.203(b), within 30 calendar days after the:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.207 <span class="Italic">Registration area</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, RPL registration is limited to the local commuting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;If the agency has, or will have, no competitive service positions remaining in the local commuting area from which the RPL eligible will be separated under part 351 of this chapter, the agency may designate a different local commuting area where there are continuing positions for the RPL eligible to exercise placement priority. The agency has sole discretion over whether to offer this option and which local commuting area to designate, taking into consideration the size and locations of its workforce, available vacancies, and available funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If the RPL eligible agreed to transfer with his or her function under part 351 of this chapter but will be separated by RIF from the gaining competitive area, registration is limited to the RPL covering the gaining competitive area's local commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;For an individual who is eligible under &#x00A7; 330.203(b), registration is initially limited to the RPL covering the local commuting area of the position from which the employee was separated. The agency must establish a fair and consistent policy that permits RPL eligibles to expand their registration to available local commuting areas mutually acceptable to the RPL eligible and the agency, up to agency-wide as required by 5 U.S.C. 8151. (For example, an agency could consider the number and location(s) of its positions and funding availability when establishing its policies on expanding consideration.) In lieu of expanded registration, the agency policy may provide for the RPL eligible to elect to receive placement priority for the next best available position in the former local commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;If the RPL eligible was, or will be, separated from an overseas position (see part 301 of this chapter), RPL registration is limited to the local commuting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated, unless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The agency approves a written request by the RPL eligible for registration in the local commuting area from which employed for overseas service, or in another area within the United States that is mutually acceptable to the eligible and the agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The agency has a formal program for rotating employees between overseas areas and the United States, and the RPL eligible's preceding and prospective overseas service would exceed the maximum duration of an overseas duty tour in the rotation program. In this case, the eligible may register for a local commuting area within the United States that is mutually acceptable to the eligible and the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.208 <span class="Italic">Duration of RPL registration</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;RPL registration expires 2 years from the date of reduction in force separation under part 351 of this chapter, or 2 years from the date the agency registers the RPL eligible because of recovery from a compensable work injury under &#x00A7; 330.206(a)(3)(i) or (ii). An RPL eligible remains registered for the full 2-year period unless the registrant is removed from the RPL for a reason specified in &#x00A7; 330.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003;OPM may extend the registration period when an RPL eligible does not receive a full 2 years of placement priority, for example, because of an agency's administrative or procedural error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Either the agency or the RPL eligible may request OPM to extend the registration period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The request must describe the administrative or procedural error that caused the RPL eligible to be registered for less than the full 2-year period. OPM may request additional information either from the agency or the RPL eligible in connection with any such request. OPM will notify both the agency and the RPL eligible of the decision to approve or deny an extension request. OPM's decision regarding an extension request is not subject to appeal under &#x00A7; 330.214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.209 <span class="Italic">Removal from an RPL</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An RPL registrant is removed from the RPL at all registered grades or pay levels if the registrant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Declines or fails to reply to the agency's inquiry about an RPL offer of a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit for a position having the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as the position from which the registrant was, or will be, separated;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Requests the agency to remove his or her name from the RPL;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Is placed in a position without time limit at any grade or pay level within the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Is placed in a position under a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit at any grade or pay level in any agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Leaves the area covered by an overseas RPL (see 5 CFR part 301) or is ineligible for continued overseas employment because of previous service or residence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An RPL registrant is removed from the RPL at registered grades or pay levels with a representative rate at and below the representative rate of a position offered by the agency if the offered position is below the last grade or pay level held and the registrant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Declines or fails to reply to the agency's inquiry about an RPL offer of a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit for a position meeting the acceptable conditions shown on the RPL registrant's application; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Declines or fails to appear for a scheduled interview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An RPL registrant removed from the RPL under paragraph (b) of this section at lower grades or pay levels than the last grade or pay level held remains on the RPL for positions with a representative rate higher than the offered position up to the grade or pay level last held, unless registration expires or otherwise terminates.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.210 <span class="Italic">Applying RPL placement priority</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;RPL placement priority applies to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Permanent and time-limited positions to be filled by competitive service appointment; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The grade or pay level at which the agency fills the position. If a position is available at multiple grades or pay levels, placement priority applies at the grade or pay level at which the position is ultimately filled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An agency must not effect a permanent or time-limited competitive service appointment of another individual if there is an RPL placement priority candidate registered for the vacancy, unless the action is listed as an exception in &#x00A7; 330.211.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency must document that there are no RPL placement priority candidates for the vacancy when requesting a competitive certificate of <span id="Page_3094"></span>eligibles under part 332 of this chapter. Similarly, an agency must offer the vacancy to any RPL placement priority candidate(s) before effecting an appointment under a noncompetitive appointing authority, such as under part 315 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Once an agency has ensured there are no RPL placement priority candidates for a particular vacancy and documents in writing an employment offer that is accepted by another individual, the agency may fulfill that employment offer to that individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.211 <span class="Italic">Exceptions to RPL placement priority</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may effect the following personnel actions as exceptions to &#x00A7; 330.210:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Fill a vacancy with an employee of the agency's current permanent competitive service workforce through detail or position change, subject to the requirements of subpart F of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Appoint a 10-point preference eligible through an appropriate appointing authority;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Appoint a current or former employee exercising restoration rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or disability within 1 year;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Appoint a current or former employee exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Fill a specific position when all RPL placement priority candidates decline an offer of the position or fail to respond to a written agency inquiry about their availability;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Convert an employee serving under an appointment that provides noncompetitive conversion eligibility to a competitive service appointment, including from:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A Veterans Recruitment Appointment under part 307 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 and part 316 of this chapter of a veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;Reappoint without a break in service to the same position currently held by an employee serving under a temporary appointment of 1 year or less (only to another temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year or less);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;Extend an employee's temporary or term appointment up to the maximum permitted by the appointment authority or as authorized by OPM; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(i)&#x2003;Appoint an individual under an excepted service appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.212 <span class="Italic">Agency flexibilities</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may provide the following flexibilities within its written RPL policies established under this subpart:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Allow RPL eligibles to register only for certain sub-areas of a local commuting area when the agency has components dispersed throughout a large commuting area. However, an agency cannot deny registration throughout the local commuting area if the RPL eligible requests it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Suspend an RPL registration for all positions, permanent and time-limited, if the agency is unable, through documented written means, to contact the RPL registrant; however, the agency must reactivate an RPL registration when the registrant submits an updated application or otherwise requests reactivation in writing. Registration suspension and reactivation do not change the expiration date of the original registration period set in &#x00A7; 330.208.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)(1) Modify the OPM or OPM-approved qualification standard used to determine if an RPL eligible is qualified for a position, provided the:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Exception is applied consistently and equitably in filling a position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;RPL registrant meets any minimum educational requirements for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;RPL registrant has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position, as determined by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any modification to the qualification standard under paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not authorize a waiver of the selection order required under &#x00A7; 330.213.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Permit RPL eligibles to register for positions with work schedules different from the work schedule of the position from which they were, or will be, separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;Permit RPL registrants to update their qualifications or conditions for accepting positions during the RPL registration period. If an agency provides this flexibility in its RPL policies, the agency must update the RPL registrant's registration information within 10 calendar days of receipt of the registrant's written request. The updated registration information would apply only to those vacancies becoming available after the agency updates the RPL registrant's registration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 330.213 <span class="Italic">Selection from an RPL</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods</span>. An agency must adopt one of the selection methods in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section for a single RPL. The agency may adopt the same method for each RPL it establishes or may vary the method by location, but it must adopt a written policy for each RPL it establishes and maintains. While an agency may not vary the method used for an individual vacancy, it may at any time change the selection method for all positions covered by a single RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Retention standing order</span>. For each vacancy to be filled, the agency places qualified RPL placement priority candidates in tenure group and subgroup order in accordance with part 351 of this chapter. In making a selection, an agency may not pass over a candidate in tenure group I to select from tenure group II and, within a tenure group, may not pass over a candidate in a higher subgroup to select from a lower subgroup. Within a subgroup, an agency may select any candidate without regard to order of retention standing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Numerical scoring</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates RPL placement priority candidates according to their job experience and education. The agency must use job-related evaluation criteria for the position to be filled that can distinguish differences in qualifications measured and must apply the criteria in a fair and consistent manner. The agency assigns the candidates a numerical score of at least 70 on a scale of 100, based on the evaluation criteria developed under this paragraph. The agency must grant 5 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3)(A) and (B), and 10 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3) (C) through (G).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;RPL placement priority candidates with an eligible numerical score are ranked in the following order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Veterans' preference eligibles having a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more in the order of their augmented ratings, unless the position to be filled is a professional or scientific position at or above the GS-9 level, or equivalent; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;All other candidates in the order of their augmented ratings. At each score, candidates entitled to 10-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of all other candidates, and those entitled to 5-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of those candidates not entitled to veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency must make its selection from among the highest three candidates available and may not pass over a veterans' preference eligible to select a nonpreference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Alternative rating and selection</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;For each vacancy to be filled, the agency may use alternative rating and selection procedures (also called category rating) as described in 5 U.S.C. 3319 and part 337 of this chapter. The agency assesses RPL placement priority candidates against job-related evaluation criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined quality categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;To use this method, the agency must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Establish a system for evaluating RPL placement priority candidates that provides for two or more quality categories;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Define each quality category through job analysis conducted in accordance with the "Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures" at 29 CFR part 1607 and part 300 of this chapter. Each quality category must have a clear definition that distinguishes it from other quality categories; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Place candidates into the appropriate quality categories based upon their job-related competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Veterans' preference must be applied as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 3319(b) and (c)(2). Veterans' preference points as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not applied under this method.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The agency must make its selection from the highest quality category in accordance with its category rating policy established under part 337 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application-based procedure</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An agency may adopt an application-based procedure which allows RPL registrants to apply directly for RPL placement priority under an advertised vacancy announcement. Before using this procedure, the agency must establish policies and procedures for:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span id="Page_3095"></span>(i)&#x2003;Informing RPL registrants of available vacancies;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;Informing RPL registrants of acceptable application formats, including how to permanently change initial registration information and how to apply changes only to the specific vacancy announcement for which the application is made;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;Determining the method under which the RPL registrant will be rated and ranked (paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iv)&#x2003;Informing each RPL registrant who applies under this method whether he or she was determined to be an RPL placement priority candidate and the outcome of the selection process, if the candidate was referred for selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;RPL registrants may not be removed from the RPL for failure to apply for a vacancy under this paragraph. Registration continues until it expires or the registrant is removed from the RPL under &#x00A7; 330.209.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...A competitive service employee entitled to priority consideration may appeal a violation of her restoration rights to the Board by presenting factual information that her reemployment priority rights were violated because of the employment of another person who could not have been appointed properly....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stuck v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 72 MSPR 153, 156-57 (1996), helped define reemployment rights under OPM and agency regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reemployment priority rights are governed by 5 CFR part 330, subpart B. Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209, the appellant has the right to appeal to the Board if she believes that her reemployment priority rights have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly. <span class="Italic">See also Ryan v. ICC</span>, 70 MSPR 17, 19 (1996). The regulations provide that an agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position when a qualified individual is available on the agency's RPL unless the first individual is on the agency's rolls. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.205. The administrative judge found that the appellant did not assert that the other employees in appeal (1) were not on the agency's rolls. Also, he correctly found that the regulations provide that an agency must clear the RPL only at the grade level at which it fills a position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.205(d). However, the appellant asserted that, under the PPP, the agency was required to consider her before other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Board has no jurisdiction to consider the appellant's allegations concerning the PPP. However, 5 CFR part 330, subpart B specifically provides that an agency may operate its own placement program for its employees in lieu of maintaining a distinct RPL. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.201(c). Here, the agency maintained both a RPL and its own placement program--the PPP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 382 (1980)] does not support the administrative judge's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review allegations concerning the PPP. <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> involved an employee who was challenging simply his area of registration under the agency's PPP. He was <span class="Italic">not</span> separated from his position, and thus had no right to appeal to the Board under the regulations governing alleged violations of reemployment priority rights. <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 3 MSPR at 297-98; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Gometz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 284, 288-89 (1996); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 20, 23-24 (1989). Here, because the appellant was separated by RIF, she has a right to appeal to the Board from a violation of her reemployment priority rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209; <span class="Italic">see</span> also <span class="Italic">Carey v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 768 F.2d 1338, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (in relation to positive placement or displaced employee programs, the Board functions to review allegations of specific harms and the causation thereof).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in her petitions for review, the appellant asserts that her "overriding argument" has been that the agency has used the PPP, its rules, regulations and policy, in lieu of the RPL during an employee's first year of separation from her position. The agency's own evidence supports the appellant's assertion. Thus, we find that the appellant has shown that to deny her review of her claims under the PPP in effect denies her review by the Board of her claims under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209. In this regard, the Board has found that it will enforce an agency's own policy or regulation regarding the filling of vacancies, even if that policy or regulation grants the employee greater rights than she would have under the general regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Monk v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 560, 562 (1995) (the Board will enforce an agency's own policy or regulation regarding the filling of vacancies during a reorganization); <span class="Italic">Moran v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 77, 84 (1994) (in a RIF, the Board will enforce employee rights mandated by agency regulations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 12, 16 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) ("[U]nder the applicable regulations, an agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position when a qualified person is on the RPL unless the individual not on the RPL is on the agency's rolls.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulations provide an appeal to the Board for employees who believe that their priority reemployment rights have been violated. The Board appeal results when an appellant is denied restoration due to the employment of another person, not from a general allegation that the agency's reemployment program is deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 329, 332-33 (1997) (nonfrivolous allegations of the denial of reemployment rights established the appellant's right to a jurisdictional hearing); <span class="Italic">Ryan v. ICC</span>, 70 MSPR 17, 19 (1996) (sufficient that an appellant, who was not represented by an attorney, implied a denial of reemployment rights through the course of his RIF appeal when the agency rehired a specific individual); <span class="Italic">Carey v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 21 n.* (1984) (for the Board to have jurisdiction, the appellant had to show that he was denied restoration due to the employment of another person); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Worden v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3408) ("The vague complaint that others were helped to find reemployment but she was not is not sufficient to state a claim upon which relief may be granted."); <span class="Italic">Black v. DHUD</span>, 78 MSPR 561, 565 (1998) (under a prior regulation, 5 CFR 330.207(d) (2010), when an agency selected an applicant over someone on RPL, those on RPL who were adversely affected by the appointment must be notified in writing of the reasons for the exception and of the right to an MSPB appeal); <span class="Italic">Freeman v. USDA</span>, 2 MSPR 224, 227 (1980) ("[D]eclination of an offer of assignment during the reduction in force period is not a proper basis for determining future entitlement to reemployment priority consideration."). The Federal Circuit agrees with the Board's interpretation of the earlier regulation, 5 CFR 330.203(d)(2) (2009), that the regulation takes an individual off of the RPL on the effective date of reinstatement rather than on the actual date the reinstatement is ordered. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army,</span> 139 Fed. Appx. 275, 277 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roberto v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1105102.html">440 F.3d 1341</a>, 1344-49, 1350-53 (Fed. Cir. 2006), determined that an agency priority placement program only falls under the scope of section 330.201(c) when OPM approved the program. Replacing a reemployment priority list with a priority placement program "in effect" does not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Roberto</span> also noted that when an agency fails to provide information about its reemployment priority list to an eligible employee as required by what is now 5 CFR 330.204(b) (2022), the employee should not be barred from enjoying the benefits of registration of the reemployment priority list, including the right to appeal to the Board, even if the employee failed to apply for the reemployment priority list within the regulatory time limit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3096"></span>Sections 330.201-330.208 require that each agency maintain an RPL and establish guidelines for the operation of its RPL. Under section 330.201(a), employees entered on an RPL enjoy, at a minimum, "priority consideration over certain outside job applicants." The regulations provide that an agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position when a qualified individual is available on the agency's RPL, unless the first individual is on the agency's rolls. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.205(b), (c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 330.201(b) requires that each agency "establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF...except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section." The section 330.201(c) exception states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart. The intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the regulations require that an agency maintain either an RPL or an alternate program that has obtained OPM concurrence or, put another way, approval, as discussed in...DISCUSSION <span class="Italic">infra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although agencies must maintain an RPL under sections 330.201(a) and (b) or an equivalent program under section 330.201(c), the regulations do not mandate that employees participate in available agency reemployment programs. Section 330.202 clarifies that placement on an agency RPL is not automatic. In order to be entered on an RPL, an employee must first complete an application within the time frame set forth in section 330.202(a)(1). Section 330.202(a)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To be entered on the RPL, an eligible employee under &#x00A7; 330.203 must complete an application.<span class="Italic">...</span>&#8197;Registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part 351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in &#x00A7; 351.807 of this chapter, has been issued. The employee must submit the application within 30 calendar days after the RIF separation date. An employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though an employee is not entitled to automatic entry on the RPL, he or she is entitled to receive information from the agency that may aid the employee in applying for the RPL. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b), at the time employees receive notices of separation or Certifications of Expected Separation ("CES")s, "the agency must give each eligible employee information about the RPL, including appeal rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee appeal rights are established by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, Mr. Roberto worked at the Navy Public Works Center ("PWC") in Guam between 1985 and April of 2000. As of 2000, Mr. Roberto held the position of Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic. On April 7, 2001, he was separated from his position due to an RIF in Guam. At the time of the RIF, DOD operated both an RPL and a PPP. It is undisputed that the PPP was not OPM-approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The PWC began issuing notices and holding briefings concerning the impending RIF in August of 1999. Specifically, Joni Santos-Borja, the Supervisory Human Resources Staff Specialist and PPP Program Manager for the Guam Human Resources Office ("HRO-Guam") conducted three RIF briefings between August and October of 1999. Ms. Santos-Borja's briefings focused on explaining RIF rules and forthcoming RIF notices. "Very minimal" references were made to the agency's RPL, which was described as optional. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Appeal rights were also mentioned, but only very generally. On November 23, 1999, Mr. Roberto was issued a CES. The CES contained a list of reemployment programs, including the RPL and the PPP, with brief descriptions of each. Mr. Roberto was issued a "RIF Notice of Separation" on December 7, 1999. Along with the Notice of Separation, he received the "Department of Defense Displaced Employee Guide." The guide included a description of DOD's RPL. It also included a description of the separate PPP maintained by DOD. Among other things, the guide specified that an employee must apply for the RPL within thirty days of separation by an RIF. The "Department of Defense Displaced Employee Guide" also described employees' appeal rights. The guide stated, "If you believe that your reemployment priority rights under this program have been violated, you may appeal to the [Board] under the regulations provided...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto did not attend any of the three briefings conducted by Ms. Santos-Borja at HRO-Guam during August and October. Nor did he read any of the information provided to him about the RPL. However, he did attend "a couple" of briefings given by persons other than Ms. Santos-Borja.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In late October of 1999, Mr. Roberto moved to Hawaii because his son required medical treatment there. Due to his relocation, Mr. Roberto was granted leave from Guam without pay beginning in January of 2000. While in Hawaii, Mr. Roberto met with Claire Hashimoto, Personnel Staffing and Classification Specialist at the Human Resource Service Center for the Pacific in Honolulu. Ms. Hashimoto assisted Mr. Roberto in filling out his forms for registration on DOD's PPP. However, she testified that she did not actually register Mr. Roberto for the PPP because that was the responsibility of HRO-Guam. Rather, she stated, she merely aided Mr. Roberto in filling out his PPP registration forms as a courtesy to HRO-Guam. Although Ms. Hashimoto typically mentioned the RPL to employees she registered on the PPP, she made no mention of the RPL to Mr. Roberto.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the forms he completed with Ms. Hashimoto's assistance, Mr. Roberto was successfully registered on the DOD PPP, as a result of which he received a temporary position as an Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic at the Navy PWC in Pearl Harbor. While working at his temporary position, Mr. Roberto also applied for a permanent position as an Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic through the PPP. HRO-Guam denied Mr. Roberto's application for the permanent position because it determined that he was unqualified. One of Mr. Roberto's co-workers at the Navy PWC in Pearl Harbor was hired instead for the permanent position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto was separated by the RIF effective April 7, 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto appealed to the Board on April 26, 2001. In his appeal, he claimed that his re-employment priority rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201 were violated because the Navy hired a person for the permanent Air Conditioning Equipment Mechanic position who otherwise would not have been hired had Mr. Roberto been properly considered for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, following a hearing, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ did so on the ground that the Board only has jurisdiction over a reemployment priority rights claim under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 if the appellant was registered under an agency RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. As seen, Mr. Roberto was not registered on the DOD RPL. Rather, he was registered on the DOD PPP, which was not approved by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ rendered his ruling in Mr. Roberto's appeal against a backdrop of conflicting jurisprudence. In <span class="Italic">Stuck v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 153 (1996), the Board considered an appeal by an individual who was enrolled in both the DOD RPL and PPP and who claimed violations of her rights under both programs.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 155-56. In <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, the Board held that it had jurisdiction to enforce the employee's claims under the PPP.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 155-57. Following <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, the Board was faced with <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Department of the Army</span>, another case involving reemployment priority rights. James Sturdy worked as a Resource Management Specialist for the Department of the Army at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. After he received notice that he was to be RIFed, he registered for DOD's PPP, the same priority placement program that is at issue in this case. He did not apply for the DOD RPL. After being registered on the PPP, Mr. Sturdy applied for one of three open Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee. After the Army found that he was not "well qualified" for the position, it declined to hire him. Mr. Sturdy was never separated by the RIF. Eventually, he accepted an offer of reassignment through the PPP to the position of Conservation Specialist at Fort Worth, Texas, with no reduction in grade or pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though he had not been RIFed, Mr. Sturdy lodged an appeal with the Board, claiming that the Army had violated his reemployment priority rights when it did not select him for one of the three Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee. In an initial decision, the AJ to whom the case was assigned dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy had not registered for the DOD RPL. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, No. DA-0330-98-0028-I-1, slip op. (M.S.P.B. Jan. 15, 1998). On petition for review, the Board affirmed the AJ's dismissal of the appeal, but on another ground. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 273 ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy I</span>"). Citing <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, the Board stated: "[a]n agency may maintain both an RPL and a PPP, and the Board has held that, pursuant to [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;] 330.209, it has jurisdiction to review an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights under a PPP." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 276. The Board thus agreed with Mr. Sturdy that his failure to register for the RPL did not "necessarily deprive the Board of jurisdiction over [his] appeal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Nevertheless, the Board affirmed the administrative judge's dismissal of Mr. Sturdy's appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that an employee could only appeal an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights if the employee was separated from his or her position by an RIF, which was not the case with Mr. Sturdy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Sturdy I</span> was appealed to this court. While the appeal was pending, however, the government moved for a remand to the Board so that the Board could address the extent to which changes in <span id="Page_3097"></span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3) affected the Board's jurisdiction over an employee who, like Mr. Sturdy, was notified of an impending RIF but was never actually separated from his position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Eligibility Due to Reduction in Force, 57 Fed. Reg. 21,890 (May 26, 1992). The government's remand request was granted. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the Board deferred to the view of OPM that actual separation by an RIF was not a necessary predicate for Board jurisdiction over an appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 502, 510 (2001) ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>"). The Board then ruled that it had jurisdiction in the case even though Mr. Sturdy had not registered for the RPL because it determined that the Army had misinformed Mr. Sturdy about the RPL and that the misinformation had caused him not to register. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 511-12. Based upon its ruling, the Board remanded the case to the AJ for adjudication of the merits of Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights claim.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;On remand the AJ affirmed the agency's finding that Mr. Sturdy was not "well qualified" for one of the three Environmentalist positions. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, No. DA-0330-98-0028-B-1 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 7, 2002). Mr. Sturdy then petitioned the Board for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The AJ's initial decision became the Board's final decision when the two sitting Members of the Board failed to agree on the disposition of Mr. Sturdy's petition. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 146 (2004) ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy III</span>"). Both Members wrote separately in <span class="Italic">Sturdy III</span>. Chairman McPhie was of the view that the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal even though Mr. Sturdy did not register on the RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 152. Chairman McPhie reasoned that the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal because Mr. Sturdy's failure to register for the RPL was due to agency misinformation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 153. Chairman McPhie would have affirmed the remand decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Member Marshall, however, took the position that jurisdiction did not lie over Mr. Sturdy's appeal because Mr. Sturdy was never actually separated from his position by an RIF. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154. Member Marshall thus disagreed with <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Department of the Army</span>, 05-3045, a decision issued today, we sustain the Board's exercise of jurisdiction. However, on the merits we vacate and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now return to the AJ's decision in this case. Noting the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Sturdy</span>, as well as in two subsequent cases, <span class="Italic">Russo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 12 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 398 (2000), the AJ stated that the Board's statements that it had jurisdiction over a claim under an internal PPP had occurred "in the factual context of cases where either the appellant had been on the RPL (which is the Board's basis for jurisdiction and the entr&#x00E9;e to enforcement of the PPP) or where the appellant ha[d] claimed that the agency improperly prevented or interfered with registration for the RPL." The AJ added that it was unclear to him "under what basis the Board may take jurisdiction over an agency's internal PPP. It appears the basis may be the 'in-lieu-of' provision of &#x00A7; 330.201(c), or a fact determination that the PPP has 'in effect' replaced the RPL, or both."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the jurisdictional issues in the case before him, the AJ rejected Mr. Roberto's argument that the DOD PPP was operated "in lieu of" an RPL, thus giving the Board jurisdiction based on Stuck and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c). According to the AJ, the most important evidence demonstrating the inapplicability of section 330.201(c) was the fact that DOD "neither sought nor obtained OPM concurrence" for its PPP. The AJ concluded that the DOD PPP involved in Mr. Roberto's appeal was not "in lieu of" of an RPL because "the DOD PPP is a concurrent, stand-alone, 'in addition-to' program."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also rejected Mr. Roberto's argument that jurisdiction existed because the DOD PPP had "in effect" replaced the RPL. Although the AJ found the evidence "indicates clearly that the PPP has 'in effect' replaced the RPL, as a practical matter," he concluded that "it is unclear how this development gives the Board jurisdiction under Part 330." The AJ stated that he was unaware of any "in effect" theory of Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As far as the DOD RPL was concerned, the AJ noted that Mr. Roberto had failed to establish that he applied for the RPL or was registered on it. At the same time, the AJ ruled that the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span> did not provide a basis for jurisdiction because Mr. Roberto had not shown that the Navy had interfered with Mr. Roberto's right to register for the RPL. As seen above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b) requires that an agency provide employees with information about the RPL, including appeal rights, at the time the employee receives an RIF notice of separation or a CES. Considering together the "very minimal" references to the RPL in Ms. Santos-Borja's briefings, the description of the RPL on Mr. Roberto's CES, and the summary in the "Department of Defense Displaced Employee Guide," the AJ concluded that the Navy had provided Mr. Roberto with sufficient information to apprise him of the RPL and his appeal rights under section 330.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto petitioned the Board for review of the initial decision. In an order issued September 23, 2004, the two sitting Members of the Board failed to agree on the disposition of the petition. <span class="Italic">Final Decision</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 156. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1200.3(b) the initial decision therefore became the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto timely appealed the final decision of the Board to this court. We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the Board's jurisdiction is strictly limited to "any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (2000); <span class="Italic">Carley</span>, 413 F.3d at 1356; <span class="Italic">Cowan v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 803, 805 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("The board has no plenary jurisdiction; rather, its jurisdiction is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation."). The provision that gives the Board jurisdiction over reemployment priority rights claims is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rules of statutory construction apply when interpreting an agency regulation. <span class="Italic">Wronke v. Marsh</span>, 787 F.2d 1569, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. United States</span>, 610 F.2d 730, 734 (Ct. Cl. 1979)). When construing a regulation or statute, it is appropriate first to examine the regulatory language itself to determine its plain meaning. <span class="Italic">Meeks v. West</span>, 216 F.3d 1363, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2000). We may also consider the language of related regulations. <span class="Italic">See Reflectone, Inc. v. Dalton</span>, 60 F.3d 1572, 1577-78 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). If the regulatory language is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning. <span class="Italic">Meeks</span>, 216 F.3d at 1366. However, if the regulation is silent or ambiguous, the court then gives deference to the agency's own interpretations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (<span class="Italic">citing NationsBank v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co.,</span> 513 U.S. 251, 256 (1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 330.209 states, in relevant part, that an appeal may be taken to the Board by "[a]n individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated...." "[T]his subpart" refers to Subpart B of 5 C.F.R. Pt. 330. Subpart B is titled "Reemployment Priority List (RPL)." It contains section 330.201, which, as already seen, requires that an agency maintain either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP to provide reemployment priority rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a) (stating that an RPL is the mechanism agencies use in order "to give priority reemployment consideration to their former employees separated by reduction in force"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 330.201(c) (stating that an OPM-approved program adopted under subsection (c) must "satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment"). In short, reemployment priority rights under Subpart B are defined by either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. From that, we think it logically flows that when section 330.209, the jurisdictional regulation, refers to "reemployment priority rights under this subpart," it is referring to rights conferred by either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. It is not referring to rights conferred by a PPP that have not been approved by OPM. Accordingly, we hold that unless a PPP receives OPM concurrence, jurisdiction over appeals of alleged violations of PPP rights does not lie with the Board. Because the plain meaning of the regulation is clear, no further inquiry is required into agency interpretations or the regulatory history to determine its meaning. <span class="Italic">See Meeks</span>, 216 F.3d at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may establish a PPP in addition to its RPL without seeking OPM concurrence. An employee faced with an impending RIF may register on both the RPL and the PPP. When an employee has such dual-enrollment, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, the Board has jurisdiction to hear appeals of adverse decisions concerning the RPL under section 330.209, ensuring that the employee's rights under sections 330.201-330.209, including the right to appeal, are preserved. Thus, it is appropriate to interpret section 330.201(c) in accordance with its plain language so as to give the Board jurisdiction over PPPs only when they have obtained OPM concurrence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties are in agreement that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c), when properly construed, requires "OPM concurrence" in order to bring appeals pursuant to an agency PPP under the jurisdiction of the Board. They dispute, however, the meaning of the term "OPM concurrence," as used in section 330.201(c). At oral argument, counsel for Mr. Roberto contended that OPM concurrence exists when a program is implemented by an agency and allowed to exist without OPM objection. On this basis, he urges that the DOD PPP in this case was OPM-approved. We do not agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that "OPM concurrence" under section 330.201(c) means that OPM has expressly given documented approval for an agency PPP. Section 330.201(c) states that an agency must "obtain[&#8197;] OPM concurrence" when replacing its PPP with an RPL. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c). In our view, the act of "obtaining" concurrence requires more than waiting for tacit consent from OPM. When subsection (c) was added to section 330.201 in 1988, OPM expressly noted that the new provision "would permit an agency to operate an alternative placement program as an exception to the RPL requirement. In the final regulation, we have clarified that OPM prior <span class="Italic">approval</span> is necessary for such an exception." Recruitment, Selection, and Placement (General); Reduction in Force, 53 Fed. Reg. 45,065, 45,065 (Nov. 8, 1988) (emphasis added). To us, this statement compels the conclusion <span id="Page_3098"></span>that "OPM concurrence" means express approval rather than some kind of tacit assent, as suggested by counsel for Mr. Roberto. Therefore, an agency PPP only falls under the scope of section 330.201(c) when OPM has expressly approved the PPP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, Mr. Roberto also argues that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal because the DOD PPP was operated "in lieu of" an RPL under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c). According to Mr. Roberto, the Navy "in effect" replaced the DOD RPL with the PPP, so that his failure to register for the RPL did not result in the Board lacking jurisdiction over his appeal. We are not persuaded by Mr. Roberto's arguments. First, there is simply no factual basis for the assertion that DOD's PPP was operated in lieu of its RPL. It is clear that DOD has an RPL and that, in addition, it operates a separate PPP. Turning to Mr. Roberto's second argument, it is true that the AJ found--and the government does not dispute the finding--that, "as a practical matter," the Navy "in effect" replaced DOD's RPL with the PPP. The AJ concluded, however, that this finding did not lead to the conclusion that the Board had jurisdiction in this case. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Merely replacing a RPL with a PPP "in effect" does not provide a basis for jurisdiction before the Board. The Board's jurisdiction is strictly limited to areas that are governed by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Carley</span>, 413 F.3d at 1356. By its plain language, &#x00A7; 330.201(c) only encompasses situations where an agency discontinues its RPL and replaces it with an OPM-approved PPP. Nothing in sections 330.201-330.209 governs an agency PPP that "in effect" replaces a RPL when the RPL has not in fact been discontinued. Mr. Roberto argues that the Board's decision in Stuck provides grounds for jurisdiction based on an "in effect" replacement of the RPL. The Board in <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> noted that the employee in that case</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">has shown that to deny her review of her claims under the PPP in effect denies her review by the Board of her claims under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209. In this regard, the Board has found that it will enforce an agency's own policy even if that policy or regulation grants the employee greater rights than she would have had under the general regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 157. If this language from <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> is read to give the Board jurisdiction over an agency PPP that "in effect" replaces an RPL even though there is no law, rule or regulation governing such an "in effect" replacement of the RPL, it would greatly expand the Board's jurisdiction in contravention of well settled law requiring a rule, regulation or statute for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (2000); <span class="Italic">Carley</span>, 413 F.3d at 1356. We do not read <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> to broadly expand the Board's jurisdiction. Because the employee in <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> was registered on both the RPL and the PPP, <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 155, the Board had jurisdiction based on the employee's registration on the RPL. <span class="Italic">Stuck</span> does not expand the jurisdiction of the Board to encompass the "in effect" replacement of RPL by a PPP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Roberto also argues that, in any event, the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal because the Navy failed to advise him of his rights under the DOD RPL. In making this argument he points to the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b). As seen above, section 330.203(b) provides that "[A]t the time it gives a specific RIF notice of separation or a Certification of Expected Separation, the agency must give each eligible employee information about the RPL, including appeal rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have not addressed whether a violation of section 330.203(b) would give the Board jurisdiction. We have, however, addressed the government's obligations under similar statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 982 F.2d 1554 (Fed. Cir. 1992), involved similar provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act of 1930, which require that the government inform annuitants of their rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j) and (k)(2).<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1559 (citing Pub. L. No. 95-317, 92 Stat. 382 (1978), <span class="Italic">as amended by</span>, Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978, &#x00A7; 102, 92 Stat. 3783 (1978) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note (1988))) ("The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, on an annual basis, inform each annuitant of such annuitant's rights of election under sections 8339(j) and 8339(k)(2) of title 5, United States Code."). In <span class="Italic">Brush</span>, the government had failed to comply with the notice requirement of section 8339. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1560. We held that a spousal annuity was not precluded by the failure of the annuitant to make a timely election because of the government's violation of its duty to inform the annuitant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 413 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2005), a statute and related regulations required that the agency provide employees with notice of separation from employment and the employee's eligibility for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1341. We held that an employee who did not receive notice as required by the statute and regulations was not barred from receiving disability retirement benefits even though the employee had applied after the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343. We think that in view of the similarity of the mandate to provide information in section 330.203(b) and the notice provisions before the court in <span class="Italic">Brush</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnston</span>, it follows that when an agency fails to provide information about its RPL to an eligible employee as required by section 330.203(b), the employee should not be barred from enjoying the benefits of registration on the RPL including the right to appeal to the Board, even if the employee failed to apply for the RPL within the thirty-day time limit set forth in section 330.202(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board addressed the exact issue before us in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, the Board held that it had jurisdiction pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.203(b) and 330.209 because the Army provided insufficient information about RPL registration to an eligible employee, thereby denying him his appeal rights. 88 M.S.P.R. at 512; <span class="Italic">see also Sturdy III</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. at 152 (separate opinion of Chairman McPhie) (noting that the Board has jurisdiction when, in violation of section 330.209, an agency fails to provide adequate information about its RPL).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we hold that an agency's failure to correctly inform an eligible employee of his or her RPL rights in a timely fashion, as required by section 330.203(b), constitutes a violation of the employee's reemployment priority rights. Such a violation of reemployment priority rights is appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b) would give the Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209, Mr. Roberto has not demonstrated such a violation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the Navy provided Mr. Roberto with information about the RPL as required by section 330.203(b), the AJ noted that the Navy held several briefings in which references to the RPL were made. The AJ also noted that there was a description of the RPL on Mr. Roberto's CES and that the Navy provided Mr. Roberto with the "Department of Defense Displaced Employee Guide" when he received his "RIF Notice of Separation." The "Department of Defense Displaced Employee Guide" contained a description of the RPL and Mr. Roberto's right to appeal to the Board. Mr. Roberto disputes neither that the Navy held briefings wherein the RPL was mentioned nor that the Navy sent him at least these two documents containing descriptions of the RPL. Instead, Mr. Roberto claims that some of the documents provided to him by the Navy described the PPP without mentioning the RPL and that Ms. Hashimoto did not disclose to him the importance of registering for the RPL when she assisted him with his PPP forms. The Navy's failure to mention the RPL at every opportunity does not undermine the fact that the Navy did provide Mr. Roberto with information about the RPL at several briefings, with his CES, and with his "RIF Notice of Separation." We hold that these briefings and documents provide substantial evidence supporting the AJ's conclusion that the Navy fulfilled its obligation under section 330.203(b) to inform Mr. Roberto about the RPL and his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 413 F.3d 1354, 1357-58 (Fed. Cir. 2005), explained appeal rights when agencies use priority placement programs instead of reemployment priority lists:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") has allowed agencies to use PPP procedures in lieu of formal RIFs for Reemployment Priority List ("RPL") rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3315. OPM has promulgated RPL regulations that state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart.

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c) (2005). Under this theory, if an agency chooses to use a PPP in lieu of RPL rights, the PPP implicitly serves the purpose of protecting RPL rights. RPL appeal rights are provided for in the regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>

According to <span class="Italic">Stuck</span>, where an agency operates a placement program for its employees under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209, RPL appeal rights arise in a PPP when an employee's rights are violated "because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 156.

Cir. 2006), concluded that even if an employee is not properly informed of an RPL list, he must still claim as a condition of Board jurisdiction that any alleged violation of the regulations governing RPLs resulted in the appointment of a person who otherwise could not have been properly appointed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the regulatory scheme that frames this case. Under the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 387 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2108, 3309-3320), "[a] preference eligible who has been separated or furloughed without delinquency or misconduct, on request, is entitled to have his name placed on appropriate registers and employment lists for every position for which his qualifications have been established." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3315(a) (2000). The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") has adopted regulations to implement the requirements of section 3315. The regulations are codified in Subpart B of Part 330 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.201-330.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 330.201-330.208 require that each agency maintain a reemployment priority list ("RPL") and establish guidelines for the operation of its RPL. Under section 330.201(a), employees entered on an RPL enjoy, at a minimum, "priority consideration over certain outside job applicants." Once an employee is registered on the RPL, section 330.205(b) entitles him or her to priority placement when a vacancy in the agency arises. Section 330.205(b) requires:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a qualified individual is available on an agency's RPL, the agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position by:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;A new appointment, unless the individual appointed is a qualified 10-point preference eligible; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Transfer or reemployment, unless the individual is a preference eligible, is exercising restoration rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or disability within 1 year, or is exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although section 330.205(b) gives employees on the RPL significant priority over other applicants, subsection (c) allows an agency to choose certain employees over candidates on the RPL. In particular, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.205(c)(2)(i) an agency may fill a specific position with "a current, qualified employee of the agency through [d]etail or position change (promotion, demotion, reassignment)" rather than with a qualified employee from the RPL. Thus, a person registered on the RPL is not entitled to priority over internal applicants for a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 330.201(b) requires that each agency "establish and maintain a[n RPL] for each commuting area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF..., except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section." The section 330.201(c) exception states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency need not maintain a distinct RPL for employees separated by reduction in force if the agency operates a placement program for its employees and obtains OPM concurrence that the program satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart. The intent of this provision is to allow agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their particular programs yet satisfy legal entitlements to priority consideration in reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the regulation requires that an agency maintain either an RPL or an alternate program that has obtained OPM concurrence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although agencies must maintain an RPL under sections 330.201(a) and (b) or an equivalent under section 330.201(c), the regulations do not mandate that employees participate in available agency reemployment programs. Section 330.202 clarifies that placement on an agency RPL is not automatic. In order to be entered on an RPL, an employee must first complete an application, within the time frame set forth in section 330.202(a)(1). Section 330.202(a)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To be entered on the RPL, an eligible employee under &#x00A7; 330.203 must complete an application.... Registration may take place as soon as a specific notice of separation under part 351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in &#x00A7; 351.807 of this chapter, has been issued. The employee must submit the application within 30 calendar days after the RIF separation date. An employee who fails to submit a timely application is not entitled to be placed on the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though an employee is not entitled to automatic entry on the RPL, he or she is entitled to receive information from the agency that may aid the employee in applying for the RPL. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b), at the time employees receive notices of separation or Certifications of Expected Separation, "the agency must give each eligible employee information about the RPL, including appeal rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee appeal rights are established by section 330.209, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Between 1993 and 2000, Mr. Rasing was employed by the Navy's Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (the "Fuel Farm") in San Diego, California. At the time he was separated, Mr. Rasing held the position of a Wage Grade ("WG")-9 Fuel Distribution Worker at the Fuel Farm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1999, Mr. Rasing took four months of medical leave. Upon returning in December of 1999, he received a Letter of Unsatisfactory Performance, which was dated December 15, 1999. The letter outlined Mr. Rasing's unsatisfactory performance in the critical element of "Execution of Duties" and explained that he had sixty days to demonstrate acceptable performance. The letter was not rescinded and no further action was taken on it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rasing's return to the Fuel Farm in December of 1999 after his four months of medical leave was brief. On February 9, 2000, he met with an Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") Counselor. During the meeting, he stated that "[he] could not be responsible that if things got so bad and [he] lost it and [he] came in and killed everyone, the command would be liable for that." The agency perceived Mr. Rasing's statement as a threat. Consequently, on February 10, 2000, it issued a temporary order barring him from the Fuel Farm. On February 23, 2000, Mr. Rasing was permanently barred from the Fuel Farm. Thereafter, the agency proposed Mr. Raising's removal, citing his statements to the EEO counselor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During late 1999 and early 2000, an RIF was taking shape at the Fuel Farm. In July of 2000, while the removal action against Mr. Raising was pending, Mr. Rasing was separated from federal service by the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the RIF, the Department of Defense ("DOD"), of which the Navy is a part, operated both an RPL and a separate priority placement program ("PPP"). The DOD PPP has not been approved by OPM under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(c). The record contains Mr. Rasing's Notice of Reduction-In-Force, which mentions that he "may be entitled to register in the DOD Priority Placement Program (PPP)." Mr. Rasing asked to be registered in the PPP, but was refused registration because he did not meet the eligibility requirements for it. Pursuant to the PPP Operations Manual employees are ineligible for the PPP if their performance or conduct is less than "fully satisfactory." The finding that Mr. Rasing's performance was not "fully satisfactory" was based solely on the December 15, 1999 Letter of Unsatisfactory Performance. In the Notice of Reduction-In-Force Mr. Rasing received, there was no mention of the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rasing alleges that his reemployment priority rights were violated in the RIF. He alleges that, instead of being separated, he should have been placed through the DOD PPP in a WG-6 Fuel Distribution Worker position that became vacant shortly after the RIF. The position was in fact filled by Margaret Lovato. Prior to the RIF, Ms. Lovato was employed as a maintenance worker at the Fuel Farm. The agency checked the DOD PPP before promoting Ms. Lovato to the vacancy.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Two recent decisions of this court speak to the jurisdictional issues that this appeal presents. In <span class="Italic">Roberto v. Department of the Navy</span>, 440 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2006), we held that the Board only has jurisdiction over appeals brought by an individual who is registered for either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1350. We also held, however, that even when an individual fails to register for an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP, the Board has jurisdiction if an agency fails to inform the individual of his or her RPL rights as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1353. <span class="Italic">Roberto</span> involved the same DOD PPP and DOD RPL that are at issue in Mr. Rasing's case. We determined that the Board lacked jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Roberto</span> because Mr. Roberto had failed to register for the DOD RPL and because the DOD PPP, for which Mr. Roberto did register, was not an OPM-approved PPP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1353. We further determined that Mr. Roberto could not rely on section 330.203(b) for jurisdiction because the agency had provided him with adequate information about the RPL. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The same day that <span class="Italic">Roberto</span> was decided, we issued our decision in <span class="Italic">Sturdy v.

Like <span class="Italic">Roberto</span>, <span class="Italic">Sturdy</span> also involved the same DOD RPL and DOD PPP that are at issue in Mr. Rasing's appeal. Despite Mr. Sturdy's failure to register for the RPL, we determined that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal because the agency had misinformed him about the RPL. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Roberto</span> disposes of Mr. Rasing's claim that the Navy violated his reemployment priority rights under the DOD PPP. Because the DOD PPP was not OPM-approved, the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Rasing's claim arising under the PPP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Roberto</span> and <span class="Italic">Sturdy</span>, however, both teach that Board jurisdiction lies over an appeal by an individual who did not register for an RPL if the individual's failure to register for the RPL resulted from the employing agency's failure to inform the individual of his or her RPL rights or if the employing agency misinformed the individual about his or her RPL rights. Mr. Rasing argues that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal because the Navy failed to inform him of his RPL rights. He urges us to remand the case to the Board so that the facts on this issue may be more fully developed. We agree with Mr. Rasing that, on the record before us, it is not possible to determine whether or not he was provided adequate information concerning the DOD RPL when he was notified of the RIF. <span class="Italic">See Roberto</span>, 440 F.3d 1341, 1353. We need not remand the case for further findings on this issue, however, because, even assuming that Mr. Rasing was not provided adequate information about the DOD RPL, the Board still lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Rasing's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As seen above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacked jurisdiction over any RPL claim by Mr. Rasing because Mr. Rasing failed to demonstrate the second jurisdictional requirement of section 330.209--that any alleged violation of the regulations governing RPLs resulted in the appointment of a person "who otherwise could not have been appointed properly." Assuming for the sake of argument that Mr. Rasing was eligible for the DOD RPL, the relevant regulations expressly allowed the agency to promote internal candidates before hiring off an RPL. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.205(c)(2)(i). Therefore, Ms. Lovato could have properly been appointed to the Fuel Distribution Worker position regardless of whether or not Mr. Rasing was registered on the RPL. Thus, even assuming the Navy failed to inform Mr. Rasing of his RPL rights, the Board lacked jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 because Mr. Rasing was not claiming that his reemployment priority rights were violated because of the employment of a person "who otherwise could not have been appointed properly" to the WG-6 position. Thus, although the AJ incorrectly concluded that the Board had jurisdiction to consider a claim, such as Mr. Rasing's, based upon the DOD PPP, her ultimate decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction was correct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To have standing to appeal the denial of reemployment priority rights, the appellant must have registered for the reemployment priority list. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 Fed. Appx. 758, 759-60 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP). <span class="Italic">Sturdy v.

Cir. 2006), decided that the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal under 5 CFR 330.209 when Mr. Sturdy's failure to register for the RPL was excused due to misinformation he received from the Army concerning the RPL, in violation of 5 CFR 330.203(b). Additionally, the agency did not have the right to inject a "well-qualified" standard into the RPL placement criteria that only required that the employee be qualified for a position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order to be appointed to an open position through the RPL an employee must meet all the requirements set forth in section 330.208(a). Section 330.208(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subject to applicable requirements of law and this chapter, an individual is considered qualified for a position if he or she:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Meets OPM-established or approved qualification standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum educational requirements, and any selection placement factors established by the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meets any special qualifying condition that OPM has approved for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Meets any other applicable requirement for appointment to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, section 330.205(b) requires priority treatment for "qualified" individuals on an agency's RPL. However, section 330.208(a)(1) gives an agency some discretion to establish "selection placement factors." In the August 1995 "Operating Manual for Qualification Standards for General Schedule Positions" ("Operating Manual for Qualification Standards"), OPM notes that "selective placement factors"[2] include "specialized agency requirements" such as specific training or educational requirements for a particular position. For example, an agency may require knowledge of economics for an economist position. The Operating Manual for Qualification Standards also notes that an agency may require that an employee have an appropriate license, registration, or certification for a particular position. Therefore, "selection placement factors" appear to be agency-established requirements that are tailored for a particular position. Further, subsection (b) of section 330.208 contains an exception that allows an agency, under certain enumerated conditions, to adopt an alternative qualification standard other than the one set forth in subsection (a). Section 330.208(b) expressly notes, however, that this exception "does not authorize a waiver of the selection order required by &#x00A7; 330.207."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;OPM appears to use "selection placement factors" and "selective placement factors" interchangeably under section 330.208. When section 330.208 was enacted in 1988, OPM used the term "selective placement factors" in the regulation. Final Regulation, 53 Fed. Reg. 45,065, 45,068 (Nov. 8, 1988). We have found no indication as to why the term was changed to "selection placement factors" in the currently codified regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 330.207 establishes two permissible selection order methods for operating an RPL. These methods are set forth in section 330.207(b), entitled "Retention standing order," and section 330.207(c), entitled "Rating and ranking." If an agency chooses to follow the "Retention standing order" method described in subsection (b), the agency is required to "place <span class="Italic">qualified individuals</span> in group and subgroup order in accordance with part 351 of this chapter."[3] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 330.207(b) (emphasis added). If the agency chooses the "Rating and ranking" option set forth in subsection (c), then the agency is required to "rate[&#8209;] <span class="Italic">qualified individuals</span> according to their job experience and education." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 330.207(c) (emphasis added). Thus, both of the selection order options set forth in section 330.207(c) refer to "qualified individuals." Section 330.207(d) creates an exception that allows an agency to appoint an individual who is either not on the RPL or has a lower standing than others on the RPL to a position when it is "necessary to obtain an employee for duties that cannot be taken over without undue interruption."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Part 351 governs "Reduction in Force." Subparts D and E of Part 351 describe procedures for determining retention standing order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee appeal rights are established by section 330.209, which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this subpart have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, Mr. Sturdy was working as a Resource Management Specialist for the Army at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas, when he received a notice, dated April 3, 1997, informing him that he would be subject to an RIF effective September 30, 1997. At the time of the RIF, the Department of Defense ("DOD"), of which the Army is a part, operated both an RPL and a separate priority placement program ("PPP"). It is undisputed that the PPP was not OPM-approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After receiving the notice, Mr. Sturdy took action to increase his chances of finding a new position before the RIF took effect. In that regard, he registered for the PPP. He did not apply for the RPL, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After being registered for the PPP in May of 1997, Mr. Sturdy applied for one of three open Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee, for which he was rated "qualified." The Army found that he was not "well qualified" for the Environmentalist positions, however, and hired three external <span id="Page_3101"></span>applicants instead. These applicants were not registered on the RPL or on the PPP. Mr. Sturdy ultimately accepted reassignment through the PPP to a Conservation Specialist position at Fort Worth, Texas, in August of 1997. Because his reassignment took effect prior to the September 30, 1997 RIF, Mr. Sturdy was never separated by the RIF. Both Mr. Sturdy's former position as Resource Management Specialist and his new position as Conservation Specialist were at grade GS-11 and carried the same pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sturdy appealed to the Board on October 14, 1997, claiming that the Army violated his reemployment priority rights when it did not select him for one of the three Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. In an initial decision, the administrative judge ("AJ") to whom the case was assigned dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy had not registered for the RPL, although he noted Mr. Sturdy's contention that the Army told him that he would be registered on the RPL as of the date of his separation pursuant to the RIF. <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, No. DA-0330-98-0028-I-1, slip op. at 2-4 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 15, 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Sturdy petitioned the Board for review of the initial decision. On Mr. Sturdy's petition for review, the Board, citing <span class="Italic">Stuck v. Department of the Navy</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 153 (1996), stated: "[a]n agency may maintain both an RPL and a PPP, and the Board has held that, pursuant to [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;] 330.209, it has jurisdiction to review an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights under a PPP." <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 273, 276 (1998) ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy I</span>"), <span class="Italic">reh'g granted</span>, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (table) ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy Rehearing Decision</span>"), <span class="Italic">rev'd, Sturdy v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 502 (2001) ("<span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>"). The Board thus agreed with Mr. Sturdy that his failure to register for the RPL did not "necessarily deprive the Board of jurisdiction over [his] appeal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Board affirmed the AJ's dismissal of Mr. Sturdy's appeal for lack of jurisdiction on the alternative ground that an employee could only appeal an alleged violation of reemployment priority rights if the employee was separated from his or her position by an RIF, which was not the case with Mr. Sturdy. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Sturdy I</span> was appealed. While the appeal was pending, the government filed a motion requesting a remand to the Board, so that the Board could address how changes in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3) affected the Board's jurisdiction over an employee who, like Mr. Sturdy, had been notified of an impending RIF, but was never actually separated from his or her position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Eligibility Due to Reduction in Force, 57 Fed. Reg. 21,890 (May 26, 1992).[4] We granted the government's request. <span class="Italic">Sturdy Rehearing Decision</span>, 230 F.3d at 1372.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In 1992, OPM altered the eligibility requirements for entry on the RPL to allow employees to register for the RPL up to six months prior to separation by an RIF. Prior to 1992, subsection (a)(3) required that an employee has "received a specific notice of separation under Part 351 of this chapter" before the employee could be entered on the RPL. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3) (1991). The 1992 amendments provided instead that an employee has "received a specific notice of separation under part 351 of this chapter, or a Certification of Expected Separation as provided in &#x00A7; 351.807 of this chapter." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3) (1993) (emphasis added). Thus, as of 1992, an employee is eligible for entry on an RPL when the employee is either separated by an RIF <span class="Italic">or</span>, alternatively, when the employee receives a CES, which may be issued up to six months prior to separation by an RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the Board (with its full complement of Members) deferred to the view of OPM that separation by an RIF was not necessary for jurisdiction over an appeal of RPL rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209. <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 510. The Board then ruled that it had jurisdiction even though Mr. Sturdy had not registered for the RPL because the Army's misinformation about the RPL caused Mr. Sturdy not to register for it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 511-12. Based upon its ruling, the Board remanded the case to the AJ for adjudication of the merits of Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ ruled in the initial decision on remand that the Army had not violated Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights when it found that Mr. Sturdy was not "well qualified" for an Environmentalist position. Mr. Sturdy timely petitioned for review of the initial decision by the full Board. In an order issued September 23, 2004, the two sitting Members of the Board, Chairman McPhie and Member Marshall, failed to agree on the disposition of the petition for review. <span class="Italic">Sturdy III</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 146. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1200.3(b), the initial decision thereby became the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the September 23, 2004 order, Chairman McPhie expressed his view that the Board had jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy's failure to register for the RPL was due to agency misinformation. <span class="Italic">Sturdy III</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. at 153. Despite the fact that the Board had jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal, Chairman McPhie would have affirmed the AJ's decision on the merits because, in his view, the agency did not err in finding that Mr. Sturdy was not "well qualified." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 153. Member Marshall, on the other hand, would have dismissed Mr. Sturdy's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In her view, Mr. Sturdy's appeal failed to meet the jurisdictional requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 for two reasons: (i) Mr. Sturdy was never separated or demoted pursuant to an RIF; and (ii) Mr. Sturdy was not registered under either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154-55.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address the jurisdictional issues in the case. On appeal, the government does not argue, as it did below, that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy was never separated by an RIF. Rather, the government argues that the Board lacked jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy failed to register for the RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. Additionally, the government argues that the Board erred in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span> in concluding that it could exercise jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal because his failure to register for the RPL was the result of misinformation from the Army.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preliminarily, even though the government does not challenge the Board's jurisdiction on the ground that Mr. Sturdy was not separated in the RIF, we must address the issue. The parties may not confer jurisdiction by consent and we must be satisfied that the Board did have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Dunklebarger v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 130 F.3d 1476, 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("[a]n agency cannot by acquiescence confer jurisdiction on the Merit Systems Protection Board to hear an appeal that Congress has not authorized the Board to entertain.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the Board ruled in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span> that it had jurisdiction, notwithstanding that Mr. Sturdy had not been separated in the RIF. 88 M.S.P.R. at 510. It did so after considering the advisory opinion that it had requested from OPM on the question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In its advisory opinion, OPM stated that "[s]ince 1987, OPM has notified agencies that RPL appeal rights for employees accrue at the time they have been specifically notified that they are to be separated based on a RIF and are registered on the RPL." Thus, it was OPM's position that, even prior to the 1992 amendment to section 330.203(a), an employee had appeal rights prior to being RIFed. According to OPM, the 1992 amendment merely changed the timing of accrual to allow employees to acquire RPL appeal rights after receiving a CES. Based upon OPM's views, the Board reasoned that separation by RIF is not a jurisdictional requirement for an appeal of reemployment priority rights. <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 510. The Board noted that OPM's interpretation was "neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the Board was persuaded that public policy favored allowing an employee to appeal reemployment priority rights prior to the employee's separation by an RIF. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We see no error in the Board's ruling on this jurisdictional point. OPM's position and the Board's ruling are consistent with the language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdictional arguments that the government does make are resolved by <span class="Italic">Roberto v. Department of the Navy</span>, No. 05-3043, decided today. In <span class="Italic">Roberto</span>, we hold that the Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 over a reemployment priority rights claim that is asserted by an individual who registered for either an RPL or an OPM-approved PPP. We also hold that the Board has jurisdiction under section 330.209 over a reemployment priority rights claim that is asserted by an individual who did not register for an RPL when his or her employing agency failed to provide the individual with correct information about the RPL as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to this case, Mr. Sturdy was not registered on the RPL, and the PPP in which he did register is not OPM-approved. However, in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, the Board held that it had jurisdiction because Mr. Sturdy's failure to register on the RPL was the result of misinformation he received from the Army. <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 512. As noted, the Board based its finding that Mr. Sturdy had been misinformed on (i) Mr. Sturdy's affidavit stating that the Army led him to believe that he would be entered on the RPL as of the date of his separation by the RIF and (ii) the deficiencies in the description of the RPL that the Army provided to Mr. Sturdy with his RIF notice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In particular, the Board noted that the Army did not provide any information, verbally or in the information sheet attached to Mr. Sturdy's RIF notice, concerning when he would be registered or allowed to register for the RPL. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We see no reason to disturb the Board's finding that the Army misinformed Mr. Sturdy. The Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence in the form of Mr. Sturdy's affidavit and the contents of the RPL information sheet provided to Mr. Sturdy with his RIF notice. Thus, the Board properly exercised jurisdiction over Mr. Sturdy's appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 because his failure to register for the RPL was excused due to misinformation he received from the Army concerning the RPL, in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As far as the merits are concerned, Mr. Sturdy argued before the Board that because he was rated "qualified" for the Environmentalist positions, he would have been selected for one of the positions had the agency accorded him proper selection consideration pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.206-330.208 (before it considered the applications of the selected outside candidates). Mr. Sturdy urged that it was improper for the agency to use a "well qualified" standard as a selection placement factor under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.208. The AJ found, however, that the Army did not violate Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights by hiring three outside candidates for the Environmentalist positions. In reaching that conclusion, the AJ <span id="Page_3102"></span>relied on the declaration of Vicki Kosechata, Personnel Management Specialist and Fort Sill Directorate of Personnel. In her declaration, Ms. Kosechata stated that under both the RPL and the PPP, as applied at Fort Sill, candidates for a particular position must be more than merely "qualified." They must be "well qualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ first determined that the "well qualified" standard used in the PPP would be a valid standard if used to administer an RPL. The AJ concluded that under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.203-330.208, which govern the administration of RPLs, it is permissible for an agency to utilize a "well qualified" standard. The AJ noted that section 330.208(a)(1) permits an agency to establish its own "selection placement factors." The AJ reasoned that even if the "well qualified" requirement was a "standard" rather than a "selection placement factor" under section 330.208(a)(1), the requirement still was valid because section 330.208(b) permits an agency to adopt alternative standards for administering an RPL. The AJ found that nothing in the language of section 330.208(b) barred the Army (Fort Sill) from adopting a heightened qualification standard like the "well qualified" standard rather than a lowered qualification standard. After determining that the "well qualified" requirement complied with the RPL regulations, the AJ ruled that the Army had not erred when it applied the "well qualified" requirement to Mr. Sturdy. The AJ found that the Army had demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Sturdy was not "well qualified" for the Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question before us is whether the Army violated Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.201-330.208 by not hiring him for one of the three Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee because, although he was "qualified" for the positions, he was not "well qualified" for them. More precisely, the question is whether the Army violated Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights under the DOD RPL. There are two reasons for this. First, although Mr. Sturdy was enrolled in the DOD PPP and was considered for the Environmentalist positions under the PPP and not under the RPL, the PPP was not approved by OPM. Therefore, it is not governed by the regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.201-330.208. As a result, Mr. Sturdy's argument that the PPP's "well qualified" requirement does not comply with sections 330.201-330.208 fails because the PPP is not subject to the regulations. In addition, under <span class="Italic">Roberto</span>, the Board was without jurisdiction to consider any claims arising under the PPP. Second, the Board found that Mr. Sturdy's failure to register for the DOD RPL was the result of misinformation he received from the Army. Under <span class="Italic">Roberto</span>, as a result of this finding, the Board had jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 to determine whether Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights under the RPL were violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether Mr. Sturdy's RPL rights were violated comes down to a hypothetical question. The question is this: If Mr. Sturdy had registered for the RPL would he have been selected for one of the three Environmentalist positions? Before answering this question, however, we must decide whether it would have been proper for the Army to apply a "well qualified" standard[7] under the DOD RPL. If it would have been proper to apply the "well qualified" standard, then it is clear that Mr. Sturdy would not have been selected. That is because it is undisputed that he was "qualified" for the positions, but not "well qualified." If however, it would not have been proper for the Army to use the "well qualified" standard under the DOD RPL, the matter boils down to whether Mr. Sturdy would have been selected for one of the positions under the proper standard. If the answer to that question is "yes," then his reemployment priority rights were violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We reject the Army's argument that the "well qualified" requirement is a "selection placement factor." "Selection placement factors" are agency-established requirements that are specifically tailored for a particular position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Office of Personnel Management, Operating Manual for Qualification Standards 19-24 (1995). The "well qualified" requirement mandates that an employee "be completely acceptable," that he or she not require extensive training, and that he or she have recent experience. Department of Defense, DOD Program for Stability of Civilian Employment 3-12 (1990). Thus, the "well qualified" requirement is not tailored to a specific position like a "selection placement factor." We therefore find that the "well qualified" requirement is a standard rather than a "selection placement factor" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.208(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the pertinent provisions of the RPL itself. The RPL is set forth in Subchapter 330 of the "Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Manual" ("DOD CPM"). The paragraphs of the RPL are designated "SC." Subparagraph SC330.1 states that, among other things, Subchapter 330 implements DOD policy under Part 330 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Subparagraph SC330.3.1 provides that, within DOD, "eligible RPL applicants shall be provided priority consideration for reemployment in accordance with the provision of...Subchapter [330]." At the same time, subparagraph SC330.3.5 instructs that rights provided under the RPL pursuant to Subchapter 330 and 5 C.F.R. Part 330, including the right of appeal to the Board, "are separate and distinct" from those provided pursuant to the DOD PPP. The paragraph adds that "[t]he PPP and the RPL operate independently."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph SC330.6 sets forth eligibility requirements for the RPL. It states that individuals who meet the conditions enumerated in paragraph SC330.6--which it notes are specified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.203 and 330.204[8] --"may receive reemployment consideration" under the RPL. Subparagraph SC330.6.1.2 states that an individual is eligible for placement on the RPL if he or she "[r]eceived a performance rating above unacceptable..., or equivalent, on the last annual performance rating of record" for the RIF. Finally, subparagraph SC330.8, which deals with selection order, states that "[W]hen a <span class="Italic">qualified</span> RPL applicant is present on an activity's RPL, an activity may not make new appointment unless the appointee is a qualified 10-point preference eligible." (emphasis added). Subparagraph SC330.8 concludes with the statement that "RPL guidance on the required selection order and applicable exceptions are provided in 5 CFR 330."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Section 330.203 sets forth the prerequisites for applying for the RPL. Under section 330.203(a), an employee must serve under an appointment in the competitive service in one of two particular tenure groups, have received a rating "above unacceptable" in the employee's last annual performance rating, and received a notice of separation or CES. Further, section 330.203(a)(4) requires that an employee have not declined an offer for placement during the course of an RIF for the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as the employee's previously held appointment. Section 330.204 sets forth the eligibility requirements for competitive service employees with a compensable injury or disability. Both section 330.203 and section 330.204 also describe conditions for removal from the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the foregoing, it seems to us that two points are clear. First, DOD's RPL and PPP are separate and distinct programs. Second, the qualification standard under the RPL is "qualified" not "well qualified." That is the case, we think, for two reasons. The first reason is that the RPL is squarely grounded in the regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.301-330.208. Those regulations speak in terms of "<span class="Italic">qualified</span>" individuals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.205(b), (c)(1), (c)(2) ("Employment restrictions"); &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.207(b), (c)(1), (c)(2)(ii) ("Selection from RPL") (emphasis added). The second reason is that the language of the RPL itself supports the conclusion that the governing standard is "qualified." Subparagraph SC330.6.1.2 states that an individual is eligible for reemployment consideration under the RPL if he or she had a last performance rating "above unacceptable." At the same time, subparagraph SC330.8 refers to a "<span class="Italic">qualified</span>" RPL applicant (emphasis added). Taken together, these provisions are consistent with a standard of "qualified," rather than "well qualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, then, the RPL's governing standard is "qualified," rather than "well qualified," the question that remains is whether, at Fort Sill, the Army has properly added a "well qualified" gloss to the RPL standard. (As noted above, Ms. Kosechata stated in her declaration before the Board that, as the RPL is applied at Fort Sill, "the Agency requires that RPL registrants be well-qualified for placement into positions. This has been a consistent policy of Fort Sill....") In our view, the answer to this question is "No."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the regulations allowed Fort Sill to adopt an alternative qualification standard under the DOD RPL. As seen above, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.208(a)(1), an employee is "qualified" for a position if he or she "[m]eets OPM-established or approved <span class="Italic">qualification standards</span> and requirements." (emphasis added). Thus, "qualification standards" typically must be "OPM-established or approved." However, the government urges that section 330.208(b) gives agencies flexibility by allowing them to adopt entirely different qualification standards. As already seen, section 330.208(b) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency may make an exception to the qualification standard and adopt an alternative standard under the following conditions (this provision does not authorize waiver of the selection order required by &#x00A7; 330.207):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The exception is applied consistently and equitably in filling a position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The individual meets any minimum educational requirements for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency determines that the individual has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the government's argument. In our view, the problem with it is this: Assuming for the moment--and it is a matter that we do not decide--that DOD could properly impose a "well qualified" standard in the implementation of its RPL, that is not what happened here. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(b), "[e]ach agency is required to establish and maintain a reemployment priority list for each commuting <span id="Page_3103"></span>area in which it separates eligible competitive service employees by RIF." To effectuate that mandate, DOD established the RPL program at issue in this case. By its terms, the DOD RPL, which we have examined above, applies, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to "the Military Departments." Department of Defense, DOD CPM, subparagraph SC330.2 (1996). DOD is the "agency" that adopted the RPL in this case, and that RPL embodies a qualification standard of "qualified." There is no indication, let alone suggestion, that DOD, as the implementing agency, has adopted a "well qualified" standard for its RPL. All we are told is that the "consistent policy" of Fort Sill is to require that RPL registrants be "well qualified." Fort Sill, however, cannot effectively alter the qualification standard of DOD's RPL by applying it as if it read "well qualified."[9] Accordingly, it is the "qualified" standard of DOD's RPL that controls the disposition of this case. Thus, if Mr. Sturdy had been registered on the DOD RPL, the Army would have had to consider him for one of the Environmentalist positions at Fort Chaffee under a "qualified," rather than "well qualified" standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The foreword of the DOD CPM provides, "Use of this Manual by all DoD Components is mandatory." Further, subparagraph C100.2.3 of Chapter 100 ("General Information") states, "Civilian personnel policies, procedures, and programs as set forth in this Manual are binding on all DoD Components. Existing DoD Component civilian personnel policies, procedures, and programs may continue until superseded by law, controlling regulations, new provisions of this Manual, or related DoD Publication provision." Thus, the manual is binding on <span class="Italic">all</span> DOD components, including the Army. <span class="Italic">See Farrell v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 314 F.3d 584, 590 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (noting that an agency statement may bind the agency if the agency intended the statement to be binding); <span class="Italic">see also Hamlet v. United States</span>, 63 F.3d 1097, 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (holding that when determining whether a provision of an agency personnel manual is binding on the agency, a court should consider, among other things, "whether the language of the provision is mandatory or advisory"). Further, the Army has not directed us to anything showing that DOD intended for the Fort Sill Directorate to have the discretion to adopt different RPL policies and procedures than the mandatory policies set forth in the manual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject Mr. Sturdy's argument that the Army violated his reemployment priority rights under the DOD PPP by applying a "well qualified" standard to his application for one the Fort Chaffee Environmentalist positions. However, the Army did violate Mr. Sturdy's reemployment priority rights by misinforming him as to his rights under the DOD RPL. As a result, it must be determined whether, if Mr. Sturdy had registered on the DOD RPL, he would have been selected for one of the Environmentalist positions. That determination has not yet been made. Accordingly, the final decision of the Board sustaining Mr. Sturdy's non-selection is vacated. The case is remanded to the Board for a determination of whether, if Mr. Sturdy had been registered on the RPL, he would have been selected for one of the Environmentalist positions. In making this determination, the Board should start from the premise that, as an RPL registrant, Mr. Sturdy would have been considered for the position under a "qualified" rather than a "well qualified" standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appeal resulting from OPM regulations governing the application of reemployment rights following a RIF did not extend to displaced employees who are entitled to priority consideration under regulations formerly at 5 CFR Part 330, subpart C (2008) (employees displaced as a result of agency work force reductions, compensable on-the-job injury, discontinued service retirement or disability retirement). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lavin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 332, 333 n.* (1986) (no appeal rights under Displaced Employee Program; former employees may appeal from violations of reemployment rights then at Subpart B of 5 CFR Part 330); <span class="Italic">Colbert v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reemployment rights do not extend after an individual has been placed into another position through the RIF process, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 272, 273-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-8 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 1998, the appellant received a notice that he would be separated from his GS-11 Logistics Management Specialist position by reduction in force (RIF). The appellant was separated from his GS-11 position by RIF on October 30, 1998, and on November 2, 1998, he registered for the Reemployment Priority List (RPL). In an appeal from the RIF action, the Board ordered the agency to cancel the separation and to substitute in its place a reassignment to the position of Materials Handler, WG-6. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 282 (2000). The agency complied with this Board order, as evidenced by an SF-50 approved on August 8, 2000 canceling the RIF separation effective October 30, 1998, and a second SF-50 approved August 10, 2000 placing the appellant in the WG-6 Materials Handler position effective October 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During 1999 and 2000 the agency filled some vacancies with individuals other than the appellant. The appellant filed this appeal on August 22, 2001, alleging that his RPL rights were violated when the agency filled vacant positions with individuals that could not have been properly appointed at the GS-9, GS-11, and/or GS-12 level. The agency filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the appellant had no RPL rights when he filed this appeal because he had already been placed in the WG-6 position in compliance with the Board's order in the RIF appeal; it also argued that this appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed. Without ruling on the motion, the administrative judge found, after a telephonic hearing and on the merits, that the appellant's RPL rights were not violated. Specifically, the administrative judge found that for each of the positions in question the agency showed that each individual who was appointed to a specified position could have been properly appointed to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge need not have reached the merits of this appeal. Rather, he should have dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction since the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated his RPL rights by employing another person during his eligibility for the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant registered for the RPL after receiving the June 30, 1998 RIF notice. In accord with the Board's July 11, 2000 order, the agency placed the appellant in the position of WG-6 Materials Handler effective October 30, 1998. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at 282. OPM's regulations at 330.203.(d)(2)(ii) state that "an individual is taken off the RPL before the period of eligibility ends when the individual receives a career, career-conditional, or excepted service appointment without time limit in any agency." The appellant filed a Board appeal, prevailed, and accepted an assignment to the WG-06 position of Materials Handler in lieu of being separated by RIF. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. &#x00B6; 9. This is the position to which the appellant himself claimed assignment rights. <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the positions identified by the appellant as positions to which he should have been appointed were filled in the time period between December 16, 1998, through August 9, 2000. His eligibility for the RPL, however, had by that time terminated by operation of the OPM regulations, given that he was reemployed effective October 30, 1998, by order of the Board. Therefore, when this appeal was filed, the Board had no jurisdiction to consider any claim of a violation of the appellant's RPL rights, which had ended when the positions in question were filled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our finding that the appeal must be dismissed on the ground that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this case, we have not addressed the timeliness of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An employee does not acquire reemployment rights through RIF regulations if he resigns before the RIF is effective; his separation is then by resignation and not by RIF. <span class="Italic">Bartlett v. Dept. of Army</span>, 18 MSPR 75, 77 (1983) (because the employee resigned and was not separated through a RIF, he was not eligible for RPL placement and not entitled to Board appeal of reemployment priority rights violations); <span class="Italic">Hancox v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 30 MSPR 207, 211 (1986) ("Having voluntarily resigned before the effective date of the RIF action, the appellant was not separated under Part 351 procedures and was not eligible to be placed on the RPL or to appeal alleged violations of RPL rights."). If an employee is assured by the agency that he will be registered on the RPL on his separation date, the employee has standing to appeal a subsequent denial of his RPL placement rights if the agency fails to properly register the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/STURDY_JERRY_C_DA_0330_98_0028_M_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251029.pdf">88 MSPR 502</a>, 512 &#x00B6; 22 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency does not err by denying consideration of the appellant on the RPL to a position with a grade below the grade that the appellant indicated he would accept, <span class="Italic">Steck v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 83 MSPR 105, 107 &#x00B6; 4 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, upon being separated by reduction in force from his GS-12 position, the appellant indicated that the lowest-graded position he would accept was a GS-11, and, therefore, his name did not appear on the agency's reemployment priority list (RPL) for positions below that grade. The agency advertised the position in question as a GS 5/7/9, electing to fill it at the GS-5 level. Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.205(d), an agency is only required to "clear" the RPL at the grade level at which it fills a position. Because, by his own action, the appellant's name did not appear on the RPL at grade 5, the agency had no opportunity either to select or reject him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>,
<a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/KING_LAURA_V_SE_0353_01_0054_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248811.pdf">98 MSPR 547</a>, 553-54 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2005), described reemployment rights, particularly priority placement, relative to OWCP entitlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3104"></span>Under the regulations regarding RPLs promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, an agency <span class="Italic">must</span> give RPL candidates priority over outside job applicants and <span class="Italic">may</span> choose to afford them priority over internal candidates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a). Nothing, in the regulations, however, requires an agency to grant RPL candidates priority over internal job applicants. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Here, the agency submits the Department of Defense's RPL Guide, which provides that the transfer of Department of Defense employees may take place ahead of selections from the RPL. Contrary to the appellant's argument, the Board's order does not entitle her to rights greater than those the agency normally affords individuals on the RPL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further complains that the agency limited its search for appropriate positions to the area served by the Northwest HRSC. The Office of Personnel Management's regulations regarding the placement of fully recovered individuals provide, however, that, "[i]f the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). The administrative judge's order tracks this regulatory language. The appellant was offered a position in her former commuting area; thus under OPM's regulation, she was not entitled to priority consideration for positions elsewhere in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant complains that the agency failed to consider her for positions "equivalent" to her former GS-11 security specialist position. An "equivalent position" is one that, among other things, has responsibilities and duties that are similar to the individual's former position. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Navy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 262 &#x00B6; 20 (2003) (an equivalent position for the purposes of 5 C.F.R. Part 353 is one of like seniority, status, and pay); <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 92 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (same); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) ("status' refers to the particular attributes of a specific position, including responsibility and duties, working conditions, pay, tenure and seniority"). The printout of positions filled by the agency and used to determine the appellant's placement rights includes a number of positions with titles similar to the appellant's former position. These positions likely have duties and responsibilities similar to the appellant's former position, but no position to which the appellant was entitled was filled prior to September 10, 2001. The appellant has neither identified a selection for an equivalent position to which she believes she is entitled nor identified any other job that she believes constitutes an equivalent position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King</span> also noted that, as to promotion entitlement for individuals absent because of a compensable injury under 5 CFR 353.106, "nothing authorizes the appointment of an individual formerly in the competitive service to an excepted service position through the promotion of the individual off an RPL. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 302." 98 MSPR at 558 &#x00B6; 26.
