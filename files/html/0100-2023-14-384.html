<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-385"><span class="space">1.</span> Volunteers and Seniority</h4>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3935 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FPC Duluth</span>, 59 FLRA 481, 482-84 (2003), was a proposal that permitted secretarial positions to be filled on the basis of seniority, or inverse seniority, depending on the position, but that did not allow management to make selections based on the skills required for particular jobs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Proposal Affects Management's Rights to Assign Work and Assign Employees Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dispute involves secretaries' qualifications for two different things: (1) their positions and (2) assignments to particular teams. In this regard, the Union claims the secretaries are equally qualified for any team assignment because the Agency has qualified them for the position and because similar work is performed in all the teams. The Agency claims that a secretary's particular assignment is based on other factors, such as experience and length of service relative to other team members. We reject the Union's claim that all of the secretaries affected by its proposal are equally qualified for any unit assignment or reassignment merely because the Agency has determined them to be qualified for the secretary position. Although employees may be equally qualified for a particular position, agencies may consider other factors, such as experience and length of service relative to other team members, when making specific assignments and reassignments<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 738</span>, 33 FLRA 380 (1988). Consideration of such job-related, individual characteristics is inherent in management's rights to assign work and assign employees under the Statute<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 382.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has specifically found a proposal nonnegotiable because it did "not allow the [a]gency to make any judgment on the qualifications of those employees, relative to each other or to other employees, to perform the work" of a particular position in a different division<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 382; <span class="Italic">see also Naval Air Rework Facility, Jacksonville, Fla.</span>, 27 FLRA 318 (1987) (award deficient where arbitrator enforced a contract provision as to deny agency's right to assign employees to different shifts for cross-training purposes). Moreover, the Union's claim that the proposal concerns the unit assignments where the secretaries already work and that the duties are "similar" regardless of the assignment does not demonstrate that the Agency has determined all secretaries to be equally qualified. In this connection, the Agency explains that assignments depend on secretaries' experience and length of service as compared to other team members. The Union's claim that the Agency's current staffing does not reflect this method of assignment does not warrant a different result. In this regard, the Agency has the right to assign secretaries based on experience and length of service, even if it does not currently do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the proposal affects management's rights to assign work and assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Proposal Does Not Constitute a Negotiable Procedure Under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Union has not shown that the affected secretaries are equally qualified for any assignment. Therefore, there is no basis for concluding that the proposal constitutes a negotiable procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)2) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3694</span>, 58 FLRA 148 (2002) (proposal allowing employees to choose work assignments by seniority did not constitute negotiable procedure where employees were not equally qualified).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Proposal Does Not Constitute an Appropriate Arrangement Under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse<span class="Italic">. See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31.

<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's claim that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In particular, even assuming without deciding that the Union's proposal constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored to compensate employees who are adversely affected by the Agency's exercise of its management rights, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's rights to assign work and assign employees. In this regard, although choosing assignments by seniority is a significant benefit to senior secretaries, we find that the burden on management's rights to assign work and assign employees outweighs this benefit. We find particularly burdensome the proposal's requirement that <span class="Italic">only </span>seniority be considered when assigning and reassigning unit secretaries. In this regard, the proposal provides no circumstance in which the Agency could determine--based on experience, length of service, or some other factor--that one secretary is better suited for a particular assignment than another. Consequently, the proposal excessively interferes with management's rights to assign work and assign employees<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1138</span>, 51 FLRA at 1735 (finding excessive interference where management could consider only seniority when rejecting employee reassignment requests). The Union's proposal, therefore, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was approved for negotiations that management ask for volunteers for reassignment when it determined that a staffing imbalance existed; if there were too many, senior qualified employees would be chosen first; if there were too few, the opposite would be the selection procedure. Because the union was not involved in determining when there was a staffing imbalance, and because employees would be shifted around without changes in basic duties, there was no infringement on management's right to determine staffing or to assign work. FLRA relied on <span class="Italic">AFGE and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 5 FLRA 83 (1981). <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 6 FLRA 508, 514, 517 (1981). Proposal 6 was negotiable, requiring management to select employees by inverse seniority when choosing to use involuntary reassignment to correct a staffing imbalance. Selections for reassignments would be from among employees already chosen by management to perform duties substantially similar to those required in the new assignments. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 14 FLRA 243, 256-57 (1984). A proposal that employees be assigned from one group to another, volunteers first, or, if no volunteers, by inverse order of seniority, was a negotiable procedure. The proposal set a procedure that the agency would use when selecting among employees previously determined by management to be qualified to perform the work required by a reassignment<span class="Italic">. IAM Local Lodge 830 and Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville</span>, 20 FLRA 848, 849-50 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station v. FLRA</span>, 818 F.2d 545, 550-51 (6th Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 898 and Dept. of Labor, OSHA, Denver</span>, 39 FLRA 1441, 1442 (1991) (permitting negotiation of proposal that allowed employees to select through seniority, during a geographical reorganization, office of their choice).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were negotiable, for the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">Lodge 830</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, requiring that management solicit volunteers for reassignment and, if but one employee volunteers, select that employee unless there is an overriding exigency to be explained in writing to the employee. The proposal required management to employ a staffing roster and inverse seniority when selecting personnel for involuntary reassignment. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 28 FLRA 160, 164-65 (1987) (Provisions 2 and 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3295 and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA 884, 902, 906 (1993) (Proposal 3 negotiable: mandating reassignment of qualified volunteers or use of inverse seniority among qualified employees). A proposal was negotiable that management fill a new tour of duty by first selecting from qualified volunteers; nothing precluded management from deciding the qualifications required or determining the occupational types to do the work. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 153 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 21 FLRA 1116, 1119 (1986). But a proposal that required management to reassign on the basis of seniority was nonnegotiable. It interfered with the right to assign work. The reassignments involved duties different from those previously performed, so the jobs were <span id="page_903"></span>not interchangeable. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Dept. of Army, Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 16 FLRA 75, 75-76 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 2080 and Dept. of Army, Army Eng'r Dist., Nashville</span>, 32 FLRA 347, 354, 356-60 (1988) (proposal requiring reassignments to vacancies to eliminate staffing imbalances was nonnegotiable because proposal interfered with management's right to select from any appropriate source).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Sixth Circuit reviewed the <span class="Italic">IAM Local Lodge 830</span> case in <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station v. FLRA</span>, 818 F.2d 545, 550-51 (6th Cir. 1987). Relying on the analysis of <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1159-61, 1163-66 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the appellate court sustained negotiability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found the proposals at issue here to be of the same effect as those in [<span class="Italic">Laborers Int'l Local 1276 v. VA, Nat'l Cemetery Officer</span>, 9 FLRA 703 (1982)]; that is, it determined that the proposals merely set forth a procedure the Agency would use when selecting among employees previously determined by management to be qualified to perform the work required by a reassignment. The FLRA particularly noted section 9(c), providing that volunteers "must have the ability to perform the work assignment in a reasonable manner consistent with the character of work."... Most significantly, the FLRA noted that an exception to the requirement that volunteers be sought would be made when the character of the work required specific employees with special skills.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While acknowledging that the proposals leave management with an unfettered right to establish the qualifications required of an assignment and to determine which employees possess those qualifications, the Agency complains that if management were to determine that an employee was not in fact qualified, its decision would arguably be disputed in an arbitration proceeding. In what is apparently a worst case scenario, the Agency contends that an arbitrator might substitute his or her judgment for management's exclusive authority to determine employee qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While admittedly this situation or countless others could somehow result in an improper decision by an arbitrator in some imaginary proceeding, we prefer to base our decision on the law as it now stands. The FLRA has consistently held that arbitrators may not substitute their judgment for that of management in the exercise of its reserved rights.... If, therefore, such an occurrence should come to pass, a remedy exists....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the proposals would not allow management to consider individual characteristics such as judgment and reliability in determining whether an employee is suitable for a particular assignment.&#x2003;The Agency contends that the term "qualifications" is ambiguous in this regard. We disagree. While it is true that in different contexts the term "qualifications" could conceivably have different meanings, the FLRA has held in the context to which we are referring that job requirements are determined on an individual basis, and that the Agency is permitted to consider "job-related individual characteristics" such as judgment and reliability.... Accordingly, whether "qualifications" might have some other meaning in another context is irrelevant in light of this holding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also complains that the proposals would deprive management of the ability to assign employees based on reasons other than qualifications.&#x2003;For instance, the Agency contends that it might wish to reward past performance by extending a new employment opportunity. Likewise, the Agency argues that it may wish a particular employee to gain new experience in the job.... [W]e would simply note that the proposals in question provide that the proposed system would be followed "to the extent possible." Moreover, they specifically acknowledge that the assignment of work is a function vested in the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that, unlike <span class="Italic">National Cemetery</span>, the proposals here would simply allow management to identify a pool of minimally qualified employees and, thereafter, management would be bound to assign by seniority. Again, we disagree. Like <span class="Italic">National Cemetery</span>, the Authority has interpreted the instant proposals to mean that management has full discretion to determine the skills and qualifications necessary to perform a particular work assignment and that these proposals merely provide a procedure by which the Agency will select among those volunteers it identifies as equally qualified for the assignment. Accordingly, the Authority is bound by that interpretation. To the extent the Agency now argues that the proposals mean something else, its argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station</span> should be compared with <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1336 v. FLRA</span>, 829 F.2d 683, 686 (8th Cir. 1987), involving procedures to select those employees who would work in a more desirable office building. The union proposed a procedure that management fill positions at the preferred location by allowing seniority to break the tie between employees who met basic qualifications for vacancies. Affirming FLRA's ruling of nonnegotiability, the Eighth Circuit ruled:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Center...argues that "qualifications" in this context can have more than one meaning. There are such things as minimum qualifications, the kinds of things that can be put down on paper, for example, whether someone has passed an examination.... The employer insists...that there is another relevant sense in which qualifications come into play. There are such things as personal qualifications, like reliability or speed of work, and those qualities, all of which are job-related, vary from one individual to another. The mere fact, accordingly, that each member of a group of employees selected for promotion is minimally qualified does not necessarily mean that each such member is equally qualified....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The leading case appears to be <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140 (D.C. Cir. 1981).... There, union proposals that would have compelled selection of a particular individual, based on seniority, at least in some instances, were held nonnegotiable, and the "procedures" clause of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) was held inapplicable to these proposals. On the other hand, once an employer has selected a group of best qualified candidates, a union proposal to use seniority as a way of distinguishing among these candidates does not impermissibly infringe on management prerogatives, and is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville, Kentucky v. FLRA</span>, 818 F.2d 545, 549 (6th Cir. 1987). If the pool of employees we were dealing with here were all equally qualified, or, to put it another way, if minimal qualifications were all that the employer were interested in or had a right to insist upon, <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance</span> would strongly indicate a result in the Union's favor. But those are not the facts before us. Here, the Union's proposal would interfere with the right of management to use its full discretion to determine individual qualifications and skills necessary to perform a particular job assignment....</p>
<p class="noindent">A seniority-based assignment proposal will be negotiable, even if it does not explicitly give management the right to determine qualifications of employees eligible for assignment, as long as the proposal does not limit the range of factors management can take into account in deciding whether to reject an applicant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Modesto</span>, 49 FLRA 302, 310-11, 316 (1994) ("Proposal 2 permits the Agency to weigh and assess all the factors it deems appropriate in retaining employees in [other] positions."). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172</span> also approved as negotiable, as part of Proposal 2, a requirement that if the agency does not utilize seniority provisions to select an employee, the agency will provide to the union written reasons for the nonselection. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Sacramento</span>, 49 FLRA 845, 845-46, 849 (1994) (Proposal 1, inviting agreement on the selection of senior volunteers, was negotiable: "the Agency's right to determine qualifications under Provision 1 includes the right to determine that certain volunteers will not be assigned to the ALTA unit because those employees' individual qualifications necessitate their assignment to other positions.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 161, 165 (2009), was Section 13, precluding management from denying an employee's reassignment solely because of "inter-service area budgetary constraints":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to make initial assignments to positions, to reassign employees to different positions, and to make temporary assignments or details. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Div. Newport, Newport, R.I.,</span> 63 FLRA 222, 225 (2009). The right to assign employees includes the right to refrain from assigning employees. S<span class="Italic">ee United Slates DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Metropolitan Detention Ctr., Guaynabo, Puerto Rico,</span> 57 FLRA 331, 332 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 13 would require the Agency to reassign employees when the Agency has decided, for budgetary reasons, that it does not want to do so. Thus, the proposal requires management to exercise its right to assign employees and thereby affects that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties dispute whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Even assuming that Section 13 constitutes an arrangement, we find that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with management's right to refrain from assigning employees. In this regard, the proposal would benefit employees by preventing management from canceling reassignments that are based solely on lack of funding. However, by providing management no latitude in determining whether reassignments should be canceled based on funding considerations, the proposal imposes a significant burden on the Agency. In these circumstances, we find that the burdens on management outweigh the benefits to employees and that, consequently, the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to assign employees. Thus, the proposal is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">For all those wishing that they had it within their power to change their supervisors, FLRA allowed as negotiable a proposal that required management to consider a request for a different supervisor within a working unit and to provide reasons for declining a requested reassignment. <span class="Italic">NLRB Professional Ass'n and Gen.
