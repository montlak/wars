<p class="Body-Text">Voluntary acceptance of a downgrading operated to withdraw the disability annuity application filed as to the position held before the downgrading in <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 403 (1984) (relying on FPM issuances). Under the Federal Personnel Manual and the law in effect at the time of the decision, once a disability retirement application is approved by OPM, it cannot be withdrawn, even if an early adverse action is reversed. <span class="Italic">Collier v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 38, 41 (1985) (defeating a claim for restoration to an employee who succeeded in an adverse action appeal initiated his disability retirement); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 48 MSPR 161, 164 (1991) (disability retirement application may not be withdrawn once it has been granted and the employee is separated).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brantner v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 417, 417-21 (1986) (noting a change in the CSRS definition of disability), determined that an employee was not considered to have withdrawn a disability application based on inability to perform a position when the employee accepted a demotion without notice that the position change would result in abandonment of the disability retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a petition for appeal from a reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denying his application for disability retirement. The agency based its decision on the lack of medical evidence to establish a causative relationship linking appellant's symptoms of chest pain to a demonstrated inability to perform either of the two jobs assigned to him since April 1984.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant requested a hearing and a hearing was held on September 28, 1985. At the hearing, appellant testified that he worked in the position of Warehouseman (Forklift Operator), WG-5, with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) until June 7, 1984. He was then carried in a leave without pay status until he returned to work on December 21, 1984, accepting a demotion to GS-1 position of Mail Processing Equipment Operator. Appellant asserted that he accepted this demotion out of economic necessity because he had to feed his family; he had not had any income in over six months; and it was the only position available. There is no dispute that acceptance of this position by appellant constituted a demotion to a job which was not at the same grade or level as his WG-5 Warehouseman position, or that appellant did, in fact, accept the position. The OPM contended that under Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S10-9(e)(4), appellant's voluntary acceptance of the position at a lower grade constituted a withdrawal of his retirement application, and that since appellant had voluntarily been demoted to another position, the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. In support of its motion to dismiss, the OPM cited <span class="Italic">Briese v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 298 (1981), in which the Board stated that "...absent an OPM decision concerning an application for retirement from the position appellant now occupies, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal." The presiding official denied the agency's motion to dismiss based upon his conclusions that <span class="Italic">Briese</span> was inapplicable to this case because it involved: 1) a proceeding in which the former definition of disability provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6)[1] was applicable; and 2) a demotion action from a GS-12 to a GS-11 where the positions held before and after the demotion were in the same classification series. The presiding official found that under the new definition of disability, incorporated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a),[2] the Board has held that where an employee is reassigned between the issuance of a reconsideration decision and the Board initial decision, and in the absence of evidence of the employee's intent to abandon his disability retirement claim or an implied or express waiver of the claim, the presiding official should make a determination on whether the employee can provide useful and efficient service in either position. <span class="Italic">See Frankunas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 591 (1985). The presiding official further found that since, in this case, appellant was demoted from a WG-5 position to a GS-1 position <span class="Italic">not at the same grade or level,</span> and that the demotion was made after appellant was placed on permanent medical restrictions by a federal medical officer, such change in position does not qualify as a reassignment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). Based upon the medical diagnoses and conclusions of disability by appellant's attending physicians, and the record as a whole, the presiding official held that the appellant had established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is unable to <span id="Page_4161"></span>render useful and efficient service in his Warehouseman position; that the agency is unable to reassign him; and that he is disabled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). The presiding official reversed the OPM's reconsideration decision and ordered the OPM to grant appellant's disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The old definition of disability under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(6) defined disability as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Totally disabled or total disability, respectively, for useful and efficient service in the grade or class of position last occupied by the employee or Member because of disease or injury not due to vicious habits, intemperance, or willful misconduct on his part within five years before becoming so disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The new definition of disability reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">An employee who completes five years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM filed a timely petition for review contending that the presiding official erred in interpreting and applying statutes, regulations and case law. The OPM also asserts that the presiding official erred in denying its motion to dismiss appellant's appeal. Specifically, the agency argues that the fact that appellant's past and present positions are not in the same classification series does not affect the fact that the appellant no longer holds the same position that he held when he applied for disability retirement; that the demotion was voluntary; and that there has been no showing that the appellant is unable to render useful and efficient service in his current position of Mail Processing Equipment Operator. Finally, the OPM argues that under Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 831-1, S10-9(e)(4), dated June 23, 1983,[3] appellant's voluntary acceptance of a position at a lower grade is deemed to be a withdrawal of his application for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 831-1, Subchapter S10-9 (e)(4) states "Voluntary acceptance of a position at a lower grade or pay is deemed to be a withdrawal of an application [for disability retirement] . When an employee accepts a position at a lower grade or pay level after the application for disability is sent to OPM, the employing agency must immediately notify OPM. On receipt of the voluntary placement notice, OPM will cease processing the application involved. To receive any consideration for disability retirement from the position after reassignment, the employee must submit another retirement application together with supporting documentation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant responded contending that even though FPM Ltr. 831-1, S10-9(e)(4), states that the acceptance of a lower position is "deemed to be a withdrawal of an application," OPM did not follow its own regulation and treat appellant's demotion as a withdrawal. Appellant points out that it was almost six months <span class="Italic">after</span> appellant took the lower graded position that OPM issued a reconsideration decision sustaining its earlier denial of appellant's disability retirement application on the basis that he had failed, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> to show a deficiency in his service as a <span class="Italic">warehouse worker.</span> Appellant also contends that the OPM further failed to meet its requirement under FPM Ltr. 831-78, S10-4(g), in that appellant was never counseled or told that his disability retirement application would be halted if he took the lower graded position, nor was there a "written statement" introduced to show that he was made aware of the effect of his acceptance of the lower graded position. Appellant next argues that since he was never told of the consequences--as required by OPM's own regulation--, his decision cannot be considered "voluntary." In summary, appellant asserts that his involuntary placement in a lower graded position did not affect consideration of his application for disability retirement; that the presiding official did not err in reversing OPM's reconsideration decision denying his application for disability retirement; and that OPM's petition for review should be denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM's petition for review is GRANTED in order to consider whether the employing agency adhered to proper procedure(s) in effecting the demotion of appellant while a disability retirement application was pending, and whether appellant's acceptance of the lower graded position, under these circumstances, can be considered voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), an employee is entitled to disability retirement if he is unable "to render useful and efficient service because of disease or injury (1) in the employee's current position; or (2) in a vacant position in the same agency at the same grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for reassignment."[4] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(a) (1983). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R.&#x00A7; 831.502(b) (1983). As the presiding official noted, the employing agency confirmed that it had no vacant positions at the same grade or pay level and tenure, within the same commuting area, for which appellant met the minimum qualification standards. The employing agency also certified that accommodation of appellant's medical condition was not possible and that it precluded a reassignment. Consequently, we find that the GS-1 position accepted by appellant did, in fact, constitute a demotion as acknowledged by all parties. We also note, as the OPM contends, that FPM Ltr. 831-78, S10-9(e)(4), does provide that "voluntary acceptance of a [demotion] is deemed to be a withdrawal of an application [for disability retirement]." However, before we determine whether appellant's acceptance of the demotion constituted a withdrawal of his application, we must first consider whether or not his acceptance of the demotion can be said to be "voluntary." The question of voluntariness must be determined by an examination of the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States,</span> 490 F.2d 928, 933 (Ct. Cl. 1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;A reassignment is defined as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency, from one position to another without promotion or demotion." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) (1983). A demotion is defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) (1983) as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency: (i) to a lower grade when both the old and the new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or (ii) to a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM policy expressed in FPM Ltr. 831-78 S-10(4)(g), "an employee must be counseled that voluntary acceptance of a position at a lower grade or pay level terminates consideration for disability retirement...(The agency should obtain a written statement from the employee to show that he/she was aware of the effect the voluntary acceptance of a position at a lower grade or pay level would have on his/her application for disability retirement.)" Our review of the record discloses that there is no evidence in the record to show that appellant was counseled regarding the effect his acceptance of a lower graded position would have on his application for disability retirement. In fact, OPM admitted that it did not have anything in writing regarding appellant's acceptance of the demotion. Considering the fact that appellant was not counseled by his agency regarding the effect his acceptance of a lower graded position would have on his pending application for disability retirement, we find that appellant's action accepting the demotion can not be deemed "voluntary," or that he intended to abandon or withdraw his application for disability retirement upon accepting the demotion to a lower graded position. <span class="Italic">See Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the initial decision is AFFIRMED as MODIFIED by this Opinion and Order, and the agency's reconsideration decision denying appellant's application for disability retirement is REVERSED.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM's arguments regarding appellant's ability to perform useful and efficient service in the position of Mail Processing Equipment Operator <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the position of Warehouseman represents mere re-argument of facts already considered by the presiding official and disagreement with his findings and conclusions.
