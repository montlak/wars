<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-56"><span class="space">c.</span> Historical Position on Waiver</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board's approach to timeliness issues ranged from strict to draconian--even now the same can be said for some timeliness dismissals. <span class="Italic">McBurnett v. Dept. of Army</span>, 37 MSPR 395, 397 (1988), dismissed an appeal filed a day late by an attorney who expressed confusion concerning calculation of the filing period. The Board stated its then current position in <span class="Italic">McBurnett:</span> "In the interest of judicial efficiency and fairness, regardless of how minimal the delay, the Board will not waive its timeliness requirements in the absence of a showing of good cause." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bollman v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3277) (sustaining a Board decision dismissing appeal filed a day late; unavailing was the appellant's argument that the time allowed for his appeal was substantially reduced because it included three Saturdays, three Sundays, and a holiday). Interestingly, whatever progress the Board may have made as to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants, even through 2007, the Board was dismissing PFRs as untimely with the incantation that "in the interest of judicial efficiency and fairness, the Board will not waive its timeliness requirements in the absence of good cause shown, regardless of how minimal the delay." <span class="Italic">Gates v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 106 MSPR 398, 400 &#x00B6; 4, 2007 MSPB 191 (2007). And no matter what developments have been in the law, a late appeal is still very likely to be dismissed as untimely unless something by way of a reasonable explanation is offered for the delay. If there is no explanation at all, the delay is unlikely to be excused.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit generally affirmed Board timeliness decisions without much discussion of the law, <span class="Italic">Womack v. MSPB</span>, 798 F.2d 453, 456 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has broad discretion to decide whether to waive the time limit for appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1390 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Although the petitioner argues that the Board erred in holding that he had not shown good cause for a waiver, we cannot say that the Board abused its discretion in reaching the contrary conclusion. As the presiding official pointed out, even if the petitioner reasonably believed that he was permanently disabled when he received the notice of removal, "a reasonably prudent person in such circumstances would seek to correct his employment record to reflect his claim that he had not engaged in an illegal activity but instead had been forced to abstain from work due to a medical condition."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner also argues that the agency has not shown that it will be prejudiced by allowing his untimely appeal. The appellant, however, has the burden of initially showing that there was a good cause for the delay, and the agency is required to submit evidence that the untimely appeal would prejudice it only if the appellant makes that showing. 5 CFR 1201.56(a)(2) (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 814 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 737 F.2d 1029, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1984)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court reiterated its standards as to review of timeliness issues in <span class="Italic">Bacashihua v. MSPB</span>, 811 F.2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1987). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wilder v. Prokop</span>, 846 F.2d 613, 620 (10th Cir. 1988) ("If the district court finds that an MSPB action to deny a waiver of the time limit is arbitrary and capricious, it should then remand the case to the MSPB. A remand rather than a court consideration of the merits of appellant's case is the general procedure, absent special circumstances or questions of law which are determinative of the appellant's claims. <span class="Italic">Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1003, 1007, 203 Ct. Cl. 199 (1973) (remand to the appeals board is 'most expeditious and appropriate'); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Casey v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 748 F.2d 685, 687 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Strickland v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 748 F.2d 681, 684 (Fed. Cir. 1984).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 949 F.2d 391, 393-94 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the Federal Circuit initially showed some compassion for an untimely appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The reconsideration decision informed Mrs. Mendoza of her right to appeal to the MSPB, and informed her of the...limit for the filing of that appeal. She filed an appeal on July 4, 1990, some five weeks late. Mrs. Mendoza in her appeal requested "waiver for the timeliness [on] the ground that I am very old and sickly, and I can't go to the doctor for the aid, because no monies for the [ex]penses so that I can give you the certificate of a doctor to satisf[y] your good office."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB stated that Mrs. Mendoza submitted no explanation for the delayed filing of her appeal. The administrative judge's Order referred to and apparently accepted OPM's statement that Mrs. Mendoza had made no showing. Neither the MSPB nor OPM referred to the reasons that Mrs. Mendoza had given to explain her tardy filing, or made any determination as to their sufficiency. There is no support for the administrative judge's ruling that "the appellant presented no evidence or argument." Mrs. Mendoza's appeal explicitly requested a waiver of the time limit, on the ground that she is "very old and sickly." Her explanation may be viewed as in the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> category of unavoidable misfortune, or perhaps in the categories of circumstances beyond appellant's control or excusable neglect. None of the <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> factors was asserted by OPM to weigh against the requested waiver; and this five weeks of delay was not asserted to have prejudiced the government in this case. "<span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> states that when an employee presents a reasonable excuse for a delay in filing, the excuse should be accepted absent a showing by the agency of substantial prejudice because of the delay in filing." <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 737 F.2d 1029, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any contrary evidence or contrary argument, Mrs. Mendoza's request for waiver is supported by the preponderance of this admittedly sparse record. We take cognizance of the inequity when a petitioner is denied any review of the merits of a cause, for as the MSPB recognized, "[t]here are strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and that they be ensured a fair opportunity to secure from the Board an independent review of agency action."...&#8197;The dismissal thus was arbitrary and an abuse of the Board's discretionary authority, for it did not "have a 'rational basis supported by substantial evidence from the record taken as a whole.'"...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overawed and overwhelmed by the <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span> remand, the Board pulled out all the stops and, instead of simply adjudicating the appellant's claim for a survivor annuity (a vested benefit if the benefit existed at all), the Board sought and obtained <span class="Italic">en banc</span> consideration. The court then vacated its earlier opinion and substituted a new opinion affirming the Board's dismissal of the case. The court determined that the appellant was adequately informed of the timeliness issue through a show-cause order issued after the acknowledgment order. As to the appellant's assertions that she was "very old and sickly," the court stated that "the only evidence respecting either Mrs. Mendoza's health or age is that she was born in 1925 and would have been about 65 or 66 years old." The court might have suffered some internal distress if it decided that persons of that vintage were incompetent to pursue legal proceedings, so that "evidence" was not the subject of further comment by the court. The court added, however, in its <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A petitioner who ignores an order of the Administrative Judge does so at his or her peril. Litigants before the Board, whether rich or poor, whether resident abroad or in the United States, are obligated to respect the Board, its procedures, including deadlines, and the orders of the Board's judges. The doors of the tribunal are open to all claimants but only on the same terms. This is the essence of due process and equal treatment under the law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Newman offered her dissent, <span class="Italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 655-56:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for rehearing the Board agrees that "the administrative judge failed to address appellant's reasons for waiver of the time limit." This failure is neither contested nor defended by the Board, whose sole points in its petition for rehearing were that the panel incorrectly applied <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180 (1980), and that the panel should not itself have addressed the merits of the requested waiver but should have remanded the issue for consideration in the first instance by an administrative judge. This <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court, however, rehabilitates the Board's flawed procedure--and then proceeds to decide the merits itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding the case on its merits this court redefines the issue as "whether the Board improperly denied her a waiver based on her initial request." However, the Board agrees, indeed insists, that it did not base its denial on her initial request. Thus, while the Board stresses in its petition for rehearing that "the Board failed to rule on the question of whether being 'very old and sickly' constituted a reasonable excuse for a five-week <span id="Page_942"></span>delay," this court now excuses that lapse, and rules on the question based on the Board's arguments filed in the petition for rehearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Deciding the merits of Mrs. Mendoza's initial request, this court criticizes her showing for "vagueness." However, not until the petition for rehearing did the Board assert that her reasons were "vague." Neither OPM, nor the administrative judge, nor the Board, had stated this objection during any of the prior proceedings. This assertion was raised in the Board's petition for rehearing as part of the argument that the Panel had incorrectly applied <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, not in support of the Board's earlier actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for rehearing the Board now advises this <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court of what was required of Mrs. Mendoza. The Board states that her "assertion of being sickly is insufficient to support a five-week delay unless she details other circumstances such as the nature of the sickness, its duration, and how it prevented her from filing an appeal on time." None of this useful information was mentioned earlier in the proceedings; it was not communicated to Mrs. Mendoza, or even included in the Board's brief on appeal to the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mrs. Mendoza has had no chance to respond to this objection, this <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court appears to rely on it. Such criticism of her showing should have been raised in a way that allowed response, instead of appearing for the first time in the Board's petition for rehearing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Incidentally, I observe that the Board's statement of what was lacking in Mrs. Mendoza's submission does not mention documentary evidence. This court's endorsement of the administrative judge's two "orders" demanding "evidence" suggests the court's belief that explanation alone is insufficient, and that documents are required. Yet the Board now tells us that "details" may suffice. Indeed, the applicable regulation simply requires "a good reason." 5 CFR 1201.22(c) (an untimely filing will be dismissed unless "a good reason for the delay is shown"). I wonder how Mrs. Mendoza (or judges) would know what "evidence" might satisfy the Board under these circumstances, for not until the Board's petition for rehearing are we told what the Board had in mind.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In justifying the Board's procedures, this court criticizes Mrs. Mendoza for not repeating the information that she had already filed. The court states: "in spite of a specific Order from the Administrative Judge requesting evidence showing that good cause existed for the delay, Mrs. Mendoza never once <span class="Italic">thereafter</span> referred to timeliness, waiver, or good cause." This court fatally faults Mrs. Mendoza for not "thereafter" referring to "timeliness" and "waiver" or the reasons for her delay, although these precise words and her reasons had already been filed, in accordance with the Board's instructions for untimely appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court does not explain why the administrative judge's lack of responsiveness to Mrs. Mendoza's request for waiver must be twice excused, while placing the burden of prescience on Mrs. Mendoza. Mrs. Mendoza was apparently supposed to grasp that the administrative judge had failed to read her initial submission, and therefore that she was obliged to repeat it. However, even the Board does not now argue in favor of the procedure followed in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issuance of form "orders" in inapplicable circumstances can only confuse the public that OPM and the Board are designed to serve. The Board recognizes that its <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioners are "entitled to some leniency with respect to court-type formalities." <span class="Italic">Black v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 83, 86 n.2 (1989). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Rowe</span>, 449 U.S. 5, 9, 101 S. Ct. 173, 175, 66 L. Ed.2d 163 (1980) (recognizing needs of <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioners). The Board regulations state that "The judge will provide the party with an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely." 5 CFR 1201.22(c). The opportunity here provided was flawed, for Mrs. Mendoza's excuse was not considered by the Board, and she now is receiving from this court an adverse decision based on the Board's newly presented information and argument, to which she had no opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I fully agree that it is improper for a court to intrude into an agency's routine operations....&#8197;However, the issuance by an administrative judge of two non-responsive form "orders," not addressing the petitioner's request on its merits, followed by forfeiture of substantive legal rights, is not a routine operation. Judicial correction of legal error is not micromanagement of operations. It is our responsibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(c) (Federal Circuit shall "set aside any agency action...found to be...obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mendoza</span> was followed by the Federal Circuit. Appellants and their counsel were expected to read and fairly interpret acknowledgment orders from AJs requiring timely submission of information concerning the timeliness of appeals. The Board would not be faulted for initially declining to consider, through a PFR, evidence concerning timeliness of the appeal that could and should have first been presented to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3163) ("The Board may waive its filing deadline if the appellant demonstrates good cause for the delay in filing, and the Board has broad discretion in determining what constitutes good cause."); <span class="Italic">Cheguina v. MSPB</span>, 69 F.3d 1143, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (the appellant made no attempt to show, and did not assert, that evidence concerning the timeliness of the appeal was unavailable before the record closed).</p>
