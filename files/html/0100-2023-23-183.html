<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-179"><span class="space">a.</span> Only Filed Settlement May Be Enforced; Settlement Enforceable in Different Forum</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Resolution of an appeal through a settlement agreement entered into the record constitutes a final decision issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. EPA</span>, 5 MSPR 248, 250, 5 MSPB 289 (1981) (AJ must be satisfied that the agreement is lawful on its face and that it was reached freely by the parties). A settlement agreement incorporated by reference into an initial decision is enforced through an enforcement petition under 5 CFR 1201.182(a) (2022). <span class="Italic">Hopson v. DLA</span>, 5 MSPR 247, 248, 5 MSPB 288 (1981). Only a settlement that was filed and accepted by the Board into its record for purposes of enforcement furnishes the basis for enforcement. The Board will not entertain an enforcement petition concerning a settlement agreement that led to dismissal of an appeal but that was not entered into the record and accepted by the Board at the time the appeal was dismissed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burchard v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3496) (Board has no power to review the legitimacy of or to enforce settlements reached outside of its formal adjudicative process and not incorporated into a Board record of appeal); <span class="Italic">Pucek v. DOD</span>, CH-315H-14-0147-I-1 (NP 10/20/2014) ("Although the Board can consider a settlement agreement reached outside of a Board proceeding to determine its effect on the Board appeal and any waiver of appeal rights, it cannot enforce such an agreement. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 551, &#x00B6; 4 &#x0026; n.2. The appellant's request that we find that the agency has breached the terms of the settlement agreement is tantamount to a request for enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lopez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 461, 463 (1996). Because the agreement was not entered into the record for enforcement purposes, the Board does not have the authority to act on the appellant's request. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">Barker v. USDA,</span> 100 MSPR 695, 697 &#x00B6; 6, 2006 MSPB 9 (2006) ("the parties opted not to pursue the issue of the Board's jurisdiction and settled the appeal without entering the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes...the appellant cannot now ask the Board to review the settlement agreement to determine whether the agency has breached it"); <span class="Italic">Diamond v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 448, 450 (1991) (Board lacks authority to enforce an unfiled settlement); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, AT-0752-17-0015-I-1 (NP 9/27/2022) ("As the parties do not intend for the Board to enforce the settlement agreement, we need not address the additional considerations regarding enforcement, and we do not enter the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement by the Board."). If an unfiled settlement results in an action, e.g., a demotion, that is within the Board's appellate jurisdiction, the <span id="Page_5038"></span>Board has jurisdiction over the action, although the settlement agreement may result in divestiture of that jurisdiction unless the agreement is invalid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wise v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 95, 97 (1997) (appellant appealed a demotion; agency defended on the basis of a settlement accepting the demotion; AJ should have resolved the appellant's claim that the agency misled him into settling by misrepresenting his entitlement to pay retention). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-007.html#sec16-9">Filing, Acceptance of Settlement for Enforcement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a practice note, if the parties want their settlement to be accepted by the Board for settlement, the settlement should state the intent, and the agreement could add that if the agreement is not accepted for enforcement it is of no effect and the appeal will proceed. There is no presumption that a settlement agreement will go into the Board's record for enforcement, and the Board examines the settlement or other circumstances to determine the parties' intent, <span class="Italic">Lancaster v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-0752-08-0329-C-1 (NP 12/13/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before dismissing a matter as settled, the Board must decide whether the parties have entered into a settlement agreement, understand its terms, and intend to have the agreement entered into the record for enforcement by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Connolly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 3 (2010). In dismissing the appeal, the administrative judge made all of the required findings, including her finding that the parties did not offer the agreement for inclusion in the record. We see no reason to disturb those findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the Board had jurisdiction over the petition for enforcement, the administrative judge assigned to the compliance proceeding found that the record was devoid of any affirmative, explicit statement from the parties that the settlement agreement was not to be entered into the Board record for enforcement purposes. We disagree. The settlement agreement clearly provides for enforcement through the EEO process, rather than through the Board. We find that this is a sufficient expression of the parties' intent that the agreement not be entered into the Board record for enforcement purposes. We therefore dismiss the appellant's petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board lacks authority to enforce a settlement reached in another forum, e.g., the EEO complaints system. <span class="Italic">Kreusch v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 125, 127 &#x00B6; 4 (2000) (Board observed, however, at n.*, that as to a prior settlement reached during MSPB litigation, "[i]f the appellant wished the Board to retain authority over his enforcement petition, he could have requested that the EEO agreement include such a provision."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. GSA</span>, 636 Fed. Appx. 571, 574 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) ("Ms. Calhoun has pointed to no statute providing the Board jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement entered in a forum other than the Board."); <span class="Italic">Berry v. MSPB</span>, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 671 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP No. 2008-3235) (Board lacked authority to enforce a claim arising out of a settlement reached in a removal case through a contractual grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 106 MSPR 520, 524-25 n.6, 2007 MSPB 207 (2007) (Board lacked authority to enforce a settlement that was arrived at through a grievance settlement). 
It may be clear from the settlement of a Board appeal that the parties agreed on a different enforcement forum. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Ghannoum v. VA</span>, SF-1221-18-0723-W-2 (NP 7/12/2022) ("We further find that the parties do not intend to enter the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement by the Board, as the agreement itself provides for enforcement through the equal employment opportunity procedures set forth at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 639, 642-43 (1997) (finding that the parties intended the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, not the Board, to enforce a settlement agreement that provided for enforcement in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.504). Although the appellant indicated that he wishes the Board to enforce the settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Accordingly, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, we find that it is enforceable by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, not by the Board, and we do not enter it into the record for enforcement."). [Refer to Chapter 5, "Settlement; Vacatur of Initial Decision."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's policy on enforcement of only filed settlements generally follows the jurisdiction of a federal court to enforce (or not enforce) a settlement. The Supreme Court summed matters up in <span class="Italic">Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co.</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1673, 1677 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...But the only order here was that the suit be dismissed, a disposition that is in no way flouted or imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agreement. The situation would be quite different if the parties' obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal--either by separate provision (such as a provision "retaining jurisdiction" over the settlement agreement) or by incorporating the terms of the settlement agreement in the order. In that event, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of the order, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreement would therefore exist. That, however, was not the case here. The judge's mere awareness and approval of the terms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to make them part of his order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The short of the matter is this: The suit involves a claim for breach of a contract, part of the consideration for which was dismissal of an earlier federal suit. No federal statute makes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basis for federal court jurisdiction over the contract dispute. The facts to be determined with regard to such alleged breaches of contract are quite separate from the facts to be determined in the principal suit, and automatic jurisdiction over such contracts is in no way essential to the conduct of federal-court business. If the parties <span class="Italic">wish</span> to provide for the court's enforcement of a dismissal-producing settlement agreement, they can seek to do so. When the dismissal is pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), which specifies that the action "shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff's instance save upon order of the court and upon such terms and conditions as the court deems proper," the parties' compliance with the terms of the settlement contract (or the court's "retention of jurisdiction" over the settlement contract) may, in the court's discretion, be one of the terms set forth in the order. Even when, as occurred here, the dismissal is pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) (which does not by its terms empower a District Court to attach conditions to the parties' stipulation of dismissal) we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order (or, what has the same effect, retain jurisdiction over the settlement contract) if the parties agree. Absent such action, however, enforcement of the settlement agreement is for state courts, unless there is some independent basis for federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGarr v. MSPB,</span> 162 Fed. Appx. 953, 953-54 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), adopted the Board's approach that only agreements accepted into the Board's record can be enforced by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Among other things, the settlement agreement stated that the agency would remove certain references from Mr. McGarr's personnel file. The agreement also expressly provided that Mr. McGarr's appeal would be dismissed with prejudice and that, because there was some question as to the Board's jurisdiction over Mr. McGarr's original appeal, the appeal "shall be dismissed as settled, and the Board will not enter or accept the settlement agreement into the record for purposes of enforcement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before dismissing an appeal as settled, the Board must satisfy itself that the parties have entered into an agreement and understand its terms. <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1988). On August 21, 2003, the full Board issued its order dismissing the appeal as settled. In its opinion, the full Board noted that the settlement agreement called for dismissal of the petition for review with prejudice to refiling and that the parties agreed that the settlement agreement would not be entered into the record for purposes of enforcement of its terms. Further, the full Board stated that the parties understood the terms of the agreement and accepted the strictures of the settlement. Mr. McGarr was represented by counsel at the time of the negotiations and signing of the settlement agreement that by its very terms would be unenforceable by the Board and was also represented by counsel at the time of the proceedings before the full Board that led to dismissal with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement is unusual in that it provided for dismissal of Mr. McGarr's case with prejudice, but on its face failed to provide for a mechanism to enforce the terms of the settlement, such as the requirement to purge Mr. McGarr's personnel files of certain information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 2004, Mr. McGarr filed a petition for enforcement with the Board, asserting that the agency had not met its obligation under the settlement agreement to purge his personnel file. The AJ assigned to the petition issued an acknowledgement order, noting that the settlement agreement had never been made of record for purposes of enforcement. Since a settlement agreement will not be enforced by the Board unless it is filed with and accepted into the record by the Board, <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 248, 250 (1981), the AJ ordered Mr. McGarr to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed for want of an enforceable settlement agreement. In response, Mr. McGarr appealed to the Board's sense of justice, notwithstanding any jurisdictional considerations. The AJ repeated the black letter law that the Board will only enforce settlement agreements entered into the record for settlement purposes and therefore dismissed Mr. McGarr's petition for enforcement. Mr. McGarr's petition for review by the full Board failed, and he timely sought review in this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must affirm the final decision of the Board unless we determine that it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McGarr, assisted by counsel, entered into an agreement that called for dismissal of his appeal with prejudice while expressly providing that the agreement would not be entered into the record for purposes of enforcing the substantive terms of the agreement. We are not informed of the reason why Mr. McGarr would accept such a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the terms of the settlement agreement that Mr. McGarr asserts are unsatisfied by the agency were never entered in the record for enforcement purposes, the Board's determination that it lacks jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement is correct. We therefore affirm the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5039"></span><span class="Italic">Generette v. MSPB</span>, 681 Fed. Appx. 929, 933 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), noted that the Board lacks enforcement authority over settlements reached in other forums:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Generette asked the Board to grant her back pay under the Pre-Arbitration Settlement Agreement. But while the Board has jurisdiction to enforce "the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), it lacks jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements reached in another forum, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3; <span class="Italic">Calhoun v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 636 Fed. Appx. 571, 574 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 108 M.S.P.R. 502, 506 n.5 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 315 Fed. Appx. 274 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Pre-Arbitration Settlement Agreement Ms. Generette claims entitles her to back pay was reached through a collective bargaining grievance procedure and therefore is not enforceable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties did not seek inclusion of a settlement into the record for enforcement when the appeal was pending before the AJ, the Board will not, on PFR, determine for the first time whether the agreement should be enforced if there is no challenge to the validity of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wolf v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-1221-15-0389-W-1 (NP 9/24/2015) ("However, the parties decided not to pursue whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. Instead, they decided to settle the appeal without entering the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. Having so decided, the appellant cannot now ask the Board to review the settlement agreement to determine if the agency has breached it. <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 464. The Board can make that kind of review only when the settlement agreement has been entered into the record.").</p>
