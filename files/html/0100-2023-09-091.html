<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-90"><span class="space">n.</span> Agency Misrepresentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The time for filing an appeal will be extended if the appellant was unaware of his appeal rights because the agency, deliberately or otherwise, affirmatively misrepresented to appellant that he had no appeal right, <span class="Italic">Butler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 3 MSPR 465, 466, 3 MSPB 534 (1980), a situation considered in <span class="Italic">Leonard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 492, 495-96 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted that he did not file an appeal at the time of his separation by RIF because James Long, Chief, Recruitment, Placement, and Career Management Division, told him and others at a meeting that they should not grieve the RIF actions because the agency would place them in a permanent position, and would extend their term appointments, until permanent positions became available. The appellant further asserted that Long met several times with Union President Joseph Dolan, who represented these employees, and Long repeated his assurances that the affected employees would not be terminated, but would be convened back to permanent positions, when vacancies became available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record indicates that the parties dispute the representations that were made by the agency when the appellant was offered the term appointment and subsequently. The administrative judge should determine whether the agency made any representations about future permanent employment to the appellant and whether, if so, the appellant reasonably relied on such representations so that good cause for the delay in filing his appeal exists.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Toyama v. MSPB,</span> 481 F.3d 1361, 1363-67 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (discounting the effect of prior notice of Board appeal rights when mixed-case notices from the agency were incomplete and misleading); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 78 MSPR 222, 226 (1998) ("The administrative judge should determine whether the agency made any representations about future permanent employment to the appellant and whether, if so, the appellant reasonably relied on such representations so that good cause for the delay in filing her appeal exists."); <span class="Italic">Wrenn v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 21 MSPR 33, 35 n.3 (1984) (the filing time was waived when an agency letter notifying the appellant of a downgrade informed him that he was precluded from appealing the action to the Board); <span class="Italic">Stroup v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 174, 176, 6 MSPB 155 (1981) ("The appellant...was not informed of his appeal right. In fact, he was specifically informed that he could not appeal. Accordingly, the Board finds that the appellant's delay in appealing is for good cause."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Freeman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 89 F.3d Appx. 706 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (reversing the Board's determination as to the timeliness of a request for law enforcement officer benefits; the employee's SF-50s and other information provided by the agency led the employee to assume he in fact was covered for the benefit); <span class="Italic">Romane v. DOD</span>, 27 MSPR 423, 424 n.* (1985) (good cause for an untimely appeal when the agency dismissed the appellant's EEO complaint and informed him that he had no right of appeal from an adverse action). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Courtney v. Dept. of Transp</span>., AT-0752-13-0755-I-1 (NP 9/15/2014) (opaque decision implying that the appeal deadline would not be extended when the appellant appeared to assert that a human resources specialist incorrectly informed him that his record, showing a demotion, would be clear after two years); <span class="Italic">Aldridge v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 601, 604 (1982) (personnel officer's assurances to an employee and counsel that his <span id="Page_996"></span>disability retirement application would be approved (it was not), lulling the appellant into a false sense that he need not pursue an adverse action appeal, were insufficient to warrant a finding of good cause).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Late filing was excused for an individual who was notified in a RIF notice of the 20-day appeal period, but who was also told by an agency official that he had 41 days to appeal. <span class="Italic">Bohanan v. TVA</span>, 31 MSPR 275, 276 (1986). A late appeal was excused when the agency's notice of appeal rights incorrectly stated that the appeal could be filed in person or by certified mail. The appeal was delayed because the appellant lacked sufficient funds to pay for the certified mail. <span class="Italic">Elbert v.

<p class="Body-Text">Reliance on agency officials must be reasonable. Even bad advice from agency officials may not be enough to excuse a delay. An appellant who was put on notice of Board time limits did not reasonably rely on improper advice from the agency compensation officials that no further action was necessary to preserve his appeal. <span class="Italic">Bracy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 631 (1984) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sasso v.

If the appellant receives a notice from the agency that correctly states the time for filing his appeal, followed by incorrect information provided by the agency during telephone conversations, untimely filing is not excused. <span class="Italic">Moore v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1015)<span class="Italic">. But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Burch v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3046) (citing <span class="Italic">Gordy v.

Cir. 1984)) (failure by the agency to notify an employee of his appeal rights may constitute good cause for the employee's failure to file a timely appeal; however, the employee must file his appeal within the time limits once he becomes aware of the basis of his claim).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of misrepresentation may arise in contexts other than misstatements about appeal rights. The appellant may be misled by the agency concerning the underlying basis for the action taken against him, causing him to forego an appeal in the mistaken belief that the agency action was proper. Appellants arguing that they would have filed appeals earlier, had they been correctly informed of the factual basis for actions affecting them, have not received consistent treatment from the Board. The distinction in treatment may depend on whether the appellant was affirmatively misled or failed to ask the right questions at the time of the action. Reductions in force produced several cases addressing the timeliness of appeals when the appellant alleged she was unsure of the right to pursue an appeal. As to an appellant who was unsure about relying on his agency's advice that his RIF was properly conducted, <span class="Italic">Kotulak v. USDA</span>, 35 MSPR 111, 114 (1987), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, this case is distinguishable from the kind of misrepresentation case where an employee has no reason to question the information that he is given by his agency at the time of the reduction in force. That the appellant apparently had some questions during the reduction in force about whether his assignment rights were violated was evidenced by his statement that he had been told that he would have bumping rights and his admitted search for documents during and after the reduction in force. In this case, if the appellant had filed a timely appeal, he could have obtained the documentation he sought through the Board's discovery process.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expected an employee to exercise a timely inquiry or appeal if there is an indication that something is amiss in a RIF, <span class="Italic">McGill v. TVA</span>, 12 MSPR 316, 318-19 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that appellant was informed in December 1979 that a RIF of iron workers would be occurring, but that he would not be among the five employees scheduled to be terminated. His foreman subsequently advised him that an error had been discovered in the retention standing of one employee scheduled for release, and thus appellant would be among the five employees to be separated. Since the foreman advised appellant that "everything had been checked out," he did not file an appeal. Appellant did not seek to appeal the RIF until 11 months later when he happened to hear through a coworker that a mistake had been made in granting a veteran's preference to a less senior employee who had been retained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency did not meet the requirement of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.505 to keep accurate, current records for determining the retention standing of its employees, the agency had reason to expect that the personnel action against appellant had become final. Furthermore, appellant was affected by a RIF only after it had been determined that one error in the retention register already had been made. Therefore, appellant was on actual notice that errors in the retention register standing were possible. Yet appellant did not make any inquiries as to whether his separation was proper, even though the RIF notice invited questions and stated that records were available for review.[2] If appellant did not want to question agency officials, he could have appealed to the Board. In that appellant knew that he could grieve or appeal the action within specified time limits but failed to take any action for almost one year, it cannot be said that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence. Accordingly, good cause has not been shown for waiver of the time limitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Adequate grounds for a waiver of the time limitation might have existed if appellant had at least inquired whether there was any possibility of error with regard to his standing on the retention register and the agency still did not discover the error. However, appellant failed to take any timely action on his own initiative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A result contrary to <span class="Italic">Koutulak</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was reached in what appears to be a significant, unfortunately nonprecedential, decision of <span class="Italic">Martin-Alvarez v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1492), determining that the Board should have accepted an untimely appeal after the agency affirmatively misrepresented facts to the employee concerning RIF procedures. Those misrepresentations led the employee not to appeal until the employee discovered information belying what the agency told him concerning the manner and extent that comparable positions were abolished. The court discounted the argument that the employee should have appealed and then sought information through discovery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly that argument misses the mark. Discovery is intended to be a tool for obtaining evidence in support of a claim which one has already pleaded with reasonable specificity. Discovery is not a fishing expedition if one has any possible basis for a claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court continued its discussion, without deciding the question presented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_997"></span>Martin-Alvarez's second basis for arguing that he demonstrated good cause is that, even apart from misrepresentation, he did not know and had no basis for even suspecting that he had a claim prior to receiving certain information through his FOIA suit. The issue raised by this assertion is one of first impression in this court. In essential respects petitioner's argument parallels one that might be made in connection with tolling a statute of limitations. In that setting, this court and its predecessor have recognized the following principles:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In certain instances the running of the statute will be suspended when an accrual date has been ascertained, but plaintiff does not know of his claim. Ignorance of rights which should be known is not enough. Plaintiff must either show that defendant has concealed its acts with the result that plaintiff was unaware of their existence or it must show that its injury was "inherently unknowable" at the accrual date. <span class="Italic">Japanese War Notes Claimants Ass'n. v. United States</span>, 373 F.2d 356, 358-9 (Ct. Cl)...<span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Welcker v. United States</span>, 752 F.2d 1577, 1580 (Fed. Cir.)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No precedent of this court has addressed whether good cause is shown for extending the time for filing where a party would not reasonably have had reason to question the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF action as to him. Although the board has had the issue raised in at least two cases, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 168 (1985); <span class="Italic">McGill v. TVA</span>, 12 MSPR 316 (1982), the employees in those cases had not exercised diligence or ordinary prudence once they became aware that there was a basis for a claim. The board did not in those cases reach the issue of whether absence of a reasonable basis to question the adverse action, such that the employee should have become aware of or should have at least started to investigate the claim, constitutes good cause for waiver of its time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay was excused for an appellant who relied on uncontested representations of five different agency officials concerning the content of a retention register. <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 20 MSPR 232, 234 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1003, 1006 (Ct. Cl. 1973) (concerning misstatements in a RIF notice and a late appeal despite notice of appeal rights: "Plaintiff reasonably relied on the administrative misrepresentation that NASL had been 'liquidated' and, consequently, that plaintiff's VPA [retention] rights were lost to him. He acted with adequate promptness to perfect his appeal upon learning that the agency had been [reorganized] and VPA rights might still be available to him.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gometz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 284, 287-89 (1996), remanded for a hearing on timeliness when the appellant argued she was misled by an agency official concerning the need to file an appeal from a RIF to secure repromotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Depending on the particular circumstances of the case, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980), an appellant may establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal by showing that he or she reasonably relied on the statements of agency officials in delaying filing. In <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 20 MSPR 232 (1984), agency officials told the appellant at the time of her RIF demotion from a Clerk-Typist position that there were no Clerk-Typist positions to which she could be assigned. About seven months later, when her attorney examined the retention register, the appellant came to believe that she had been misinformed, and filed an appeal. She established good cause for her untimely filing because, under the circumstances presented, she reasonably relied on the representations of agency officials, who led her to believe that she had no basis for an appeal. <span class="Italic">See also Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 203 Ct. Cl. 199, 488 F.2d 1003 (1973) (where, based on misinformation in a general RIF notice, the appellant reasonably believed that he had no basis for filing an appeal, and where he filed an untimely appeal after learning that he might have had assignment rights in the RIF, the filing deadline was waived); <span class="Italic">Floyd v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 37 (1990) (the appellant's delay in filing was excused, where he calculated the filing deadline based on the incorrect advice of agency officials). An appellant's delay in filing will not be excused, however, merely because the appellant chose to attempt to reach a settlement with the agency and was unsuccessful<span class="Italic">. See Schrum v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 103 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Wall v. DHHS</span>, 9 MSPB 401, 10 MSPR 139 (1982) (the vague and equivocal statements of agency officials that they were "looking into the matter" of returning the appellant to the position from which he was demoted were an insufficient basis for excusing his untimely filing, where the appellant was aware for many months of his right to appeal and that he had a basis therefor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge should hold a hearing if there are material facts in dispute regarding timeliness and the appellant has requested a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Secaida v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 256 (1990). The appellant herein requested a hearing, and we find that there are material facts in dispute affecting the good cause determination. If the appellant reasonably believed, based on Hughes' statements, that the agency was going to return her to her former Boilermaker Supervisor position and that she therefore would receive all of the relief that she could receive by filing an appeal, then her delay in filing should be excused. In this connection, we note that she filed her appeal within the allowable time limits (19 days) after she allegedly first came to believe that Hughes had misled her, and that her overall delay in filing was not lengthy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comments from a union official to the effect that the appellant might be reinstated were not the result of misrepresentations from the agency, and they did not excuse an appeal four days late in <span class="italic">Conyers v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-315H-17-0307-I-1 (NP 7/21/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her assertion that the agency caused her delay in filing, the appellant provided a declaration made under penalty of perjury recounting various conversations related to her termination and possible reinstatement. In her declaration, however, the appellant does not identify an instance after January 4, 2017--the date of the termination notice--in which an agency manager directly led her to believe that her termination would be rescinded. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Any suggestion that the appellant might have been reinstated came through the appellant's union representative, and there is no evidence that he was authorized to make a decision on the appellant's reinstatement. Under the circumstances, we find that the appellant failed to show that any agency official made misstatements that caused her to lose time in filing her appeal. Likewise, we find that the cases cited by the appellant in her petition for review do not support a finding that agency misrepresentation caused the appellant's filing delay. <span class="italic">See Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1003 (Ct. Cl. 1973); <span class="italic">Gordy v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 736 F.2d 1505 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="italic">Gometz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 284 (1996), <span class="italic">overruled on other grounds by Sturdy v. Department of the Army</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 502 (2001). Both <span class="italic">Shubinsky</span> and <span class="italic">Gometz</span> are distinguishable because, unlike here, there was a finding in those cases that the employees actually received inaccurate information from agency officials. And, <span class="italic">Gordy</span> is distinguishable from the instant case because, unlike the employee in <span class="italic">Gordy</span>, the appellant here was fully aware of the basis for the claim on which she could file a Board appeal before the filing deadline had passed.</p>
