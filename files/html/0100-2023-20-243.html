<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-235"><span class="space">5.</span> Nature of Relief</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Stays are interim in nature. The Board neither addresses the merits nor <span id="Page_4062"></span>issues final decisions in stay proceedings. It is not until OSC files a request for corrective action that the Board addresses the merits and issues a final decision. The Board cannot, because of the interim nature of a stay, approve a settlement that would result in a permanent stay, for that relief would exceed the relief the Board is authorized to order under the statutory stay provisions. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DOD</span>, HQ12088210049 (1983) (not reported in MSPR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stays are not to be read in a technical or restrictive fashion. A party subject to a stay must do more than see how close it can come to direct violation of the order. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Califano</span>, 1 MSPR 88, 89, 1 MSPB 83 (1979); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 23 MSPR 469, 470-71 (1984) (agency violated stay order when it removed employee from probationary GS-9 Export Administration Specialist position and placed him into temporary position of GS-9 Compliance Officer; stay tolled the running of the probationary period); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 23 MSPR 136, 137 (1984) (stay freezes the employee's probationary status; the grant of an extension does not preclude the agency from terminating employee during probation should the stay not be extended). The Board may direct that payment be withheld for the services of any employee who fails to comply with a stay order. 5 USC 1204(e)(2). Additionally, a party could seek sanctions against any other parties who fail to comply with a Board order. Parties with doubts as to whether a stay order applies in a particular fact situation may apply to the Board for a clarifying determination during enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 575, 577 (1991), avoided deciding whether an appellant may raise with the Board an enforcement issue concerning a stay obtained by OSC, but the Board determined that it could raise on its own volition an issue of enforcement--the agency failed to restore the appellant to duty status as it had been ordered--for the Board "has broad and continuing authority to ensure compliance with its orders[,]" citing 5 USC 1204(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 412, 415-16 (1991), added as to an agency that, although ordered to maintain the appellant in a duty status during a stay, instead directed that the employee be placed on compensatory time status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's enforcement power over an agency's compliance with a prior Board order is far-reaching, and the Board is required to assure proper substantive compliance with its orders.... This involves ensuring, in the case of a stay order, that the employee that is the subject of the order remain in the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. Here, the agency admits placing Ms. Adams in a compensatory time status, and stated in a submission to the Board that she had not been returned to her position. It has, therefore, failed to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that it complied with the Board's stay order in a manner it deemed proper and appropriate. We disagree. The language of the Board's stay order requiring the agency to allow Ms. Adams to remain in duty status was clear and unambiguous. The agency's actions disregard this language and constitute noncompliance with the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the return of Ms. Adams to her position would have been unduly disruptive. A failure to place an employee into a position when so ordered by the Board may be justified by an agency showing of compelling reasons.... However, the agency's anticipation of disruption is not such a compelling reason. <span class="Italic">Nielson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 324, 327 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To be sure, there is regulatory authority for the agency to take many personnel actions, including the reassignment that the Board stayed in this case. This authority does not, however, excuse an agency from compliance with a specifically stated Board order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's May 29, 1990, stay order required that Adams remain in a duty status and be allowed to pursue the duties set forth in her position description pending the pendency of the stay. The agency failed to comply with this portion of the order when it required Ms. Adams to use compensatory leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 92, 97 &#x00B6; 14 (2000) (purpose of a stay is to return employee to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, not just the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>; placement of employee on administrative leave is not the same as placing employee back in the position held prior to agency's improper personnel actions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of a stay order is to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>. The Board included in the terms of its orders staying personnel actions a requirement that the agency not impose upon the employee "any requirement which is not required by any other employee of comparable position, salary, or grade level." The effect of a Board order staying an employee's removal is not just to ensure that the employee continues to receive a government check regularly. The stay order also assures that the terms and conditions of the individual's employment are not significantly different from those of similarly situated employees during the effective period of the stay. The employee is not to be relegated to substantially different or nonexistent duties after a stay order is entered on his behalf. <span class="Italic">In re Coffield</span>, 2 MSPR 525, 527-28, 3 MSPB 46 (1980). If the removal of a permanent employee has been stayed, the employee retains permanent employee status until the expiration of the stay. <span class="Italic">In re Munoz</span>, 3 MSPR 406, 409, 3 MSPB 483 (1980) (observing that "[t]he employee's removal at the end of a stay is effected through the expiration of the suspension of the original adverse action, not through a second adverse action").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If OSC seeks through corrective action to stay a reassignment, and the agency moves toward removing the employee who does not accept the reassignment, the Board may expand the stay to preclude the agency from removing the employee for the duration of the stay. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 62 MSPR 26, 29-30 (1994); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">OSC ex rel. Aran v.

<p class="Body-Text">Preliminary components of a threatened personnel action are covered by a stay, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. NCUA</span>, CB-1208-16-0012-U-1 (NP 1/29/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 27, 2016, OSC filed the instant stay request, arguing that it has reasonable grounds to believe that Ms. Rector's pending removal was in reprisal for whistleblowing, a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). OSC is requesting the Board to stay the proposed removal for 45 days, including the deadline for Ms. Rector to respond to the proposal. The agency has filed a response, arguing that the deadline for Ms. Rector's response to the proposal should not be stayed, the deciding official should be allowed to proceed with a decision on the removal action, and any stay should be limited to the implementation of the removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A removal is a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), and there is no question that a proposal to remove constitutes a threat to take a personnel action under section 2302(b)(8). The agency contends, however, that a proposed removal is not subject to the Board's stay authority. I disagree. Under the circumstances of this case, the proposed removal constitutes "an action under chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii) and therefore is a personnel action subject to the Board's stay authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 146 (1994) (granting a stay of the agency's placement of an employee on administrative leave while a notice of proposed removal was pending). Thus, the proposed removal is in the nature of a chapter 75 action and one falling within the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). <span class="Italic">See Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1992) ("[o]ther" disciplinary or corrective action must be in the nature of a chapter 75 action to fall within the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a stay of Ms. Rector's proposed removal is necessary to achieve the purpose of a stay, that is, to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> and minimize the adverse consequences of a prohibited personnel practice while the dispute is being resolved. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 40, 41 (1993). Although there may be some circumstances which would permit less than a complete return to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, the agency has not suggested any here. The proposal notice is part and parcel of a chapter 75 action and is therefore encompassed in this stay order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 72 MSPR 104, 107-09 (1996), attempted to define some measure of latitude for agencies that seek to modify the employment conditions of individuals whose personnel actions are stayed at the behest of OSC. The agency's actions must be compelling and well documented. As to an appellant occupying a position requiring a security clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A stay granted pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1) is issued in order to maintain the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> while the OSC and the agency involved resolve the disputed matter. The purpose of a stay is to minimize the consequences of an alleged prohibited personnel practice<span class="Italic">. See Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 40, 41 (1993). Therefore, during the pendency of a stay the agency is required to return the affected employee to the same position he held prior to the alleged improper agency action. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 266, 269 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is uncontested that Mr. Deans was placed on administrative leave following his reinstatement. The Board's order required the agency to return Mr. Deans to his former position, GS-1811-12, Special Agent, Criminal Investigator. Placing Mr. Deans on administrative leave after reinstating him to his former position is not a return to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf. Special Counsel v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 412, 415 (1991) (placing an employee in compensatory time status rather than returning her to her position was not in compliance with the Board's stay order).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, relying on <span class="Italic">Connor v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 389 (1991), <span id="Page_4063"></span>argues that it has only placed Mr. Deans on administrative leave pending an employment qualification determination or fitness for duty determination. The OSC contests the applicability of <span class="Italic">Connor</span> because the appellant in that case was removed for fitness reasons and had been out of his job for five years, unlike Mr. Deans. Further, <span class="Italic">Connor</span> involved a case within the Board's appellate jurisdiction and not a stay proceeding. The Board has held that for the purposes of returning an employee to duty there is a distinction between a stay proceeding and appellate jurisdiction cases in which interim relief may be awarded. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 556, 558 (1993). The statute providing for interim relief requires the Board to accept an agency's certification that returning the affected employee to the workplace would cause an undue disruption, whereas there is no similar provision for stays. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has also held that evidence showing a compelling reason for not returning an employee to duty <span class="Italic">may</span> justify a failure to comply with a Board order, but a mere anticipation of undue disruption is insufficient. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR at 415 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case the agency has shown a compelling reason for very briefly delaying Mr. Deans' return to active duty. Both parties acknowledge that Mr. Deans is a law enforcement officer. Further, the position description for Mr. Deans' position states that physical conditioning must be maintained, that the position is subject to preemployment drug testing as well as post-appointment random drug testing, and that a security clearance must be maintained. Additionally, Mr. Deans had not been in his position for eleven months when the OSC requested the initial stay. Therefore, the placement of Mr. Deans on administrative leave while the agency conducts a drug test and a physical fitness test and updates Mr. Deans' security clearance is permissible under these circumstances. However, the agency must conduct these functions in good faith, and complete them as quickly as possible. Once Mr. Deans is returned to active duty, he must be assigned the duties and responsibilities of Criminal Investigator, Office of the Inspector General.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Deans is also entitled to receive all compensation commensurate with the position of Criminal Investigator. The OSC contends in its response to the agency's compliance filing that Mr. Deans is being deprived of availability pay, which he was receiving prior to his termination, amounting to $14,127 a year.... [T]he agency must correct Mr. Deans' SF-50 and pay to reflect compensation for administratively uncontrollable overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There remains the question of the geographic location in which the agency is required to place Mr. Deans. The agency argues that Mr. Deans cannot be returned to duty in the Denver, Colorado office because it closed the Denver sub-office of the Office of Inspector General following Mr. Deans' removal. Further, the agency contends that Mr. Deans is prevented from performing the duties of his position in Denver because the U.S. Attorneys of Utah and Colorado refuse to work with him. Conversely, the OSC contends that, even if the agency's claims are true, it does not prevent the agency from assigning Mr. Deans the remainder of the 13 other duties and responsibilities provided in the position description for Criminal Investigator. Additionally, the OSC has cited several possibilities for accommodating Mr. Deans in his former location, Denver, including placing him in a Department of Transportation facility in Denver even though the Office of the Inspector General does not currently maintain separate office space there. The OSC argues that since Mr. Deans was the only agent in the Denver sub-office, Office of the Inspector General prior to his removal, it is not problematic that he would be the only agent in such an office now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is insufficient evidence in the record regarding when the Denver sub-office was closed and what effect this closing had on Mr. Deans' former position. There is also insufficient evidence as to whether the Utah and Colorado U.S. Attorneys indeed refuse to work with Mr. Deans and, if they do, the impact this refusal has on Mr. Deans' ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of his position in Denver, Colorado. Without additional evidence we cannot make an informed decision on the geographic location where the agency must assign Mr. Deans.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Special Counsel ex rel. Spalding v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, CB-1208-22-0016-U-2 (NP 9/9/2022) ("The Board has made clear that the purpose of a stay is to preserve the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, not simply the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, and therefore, if a stay is appropriate, the employee must generally be placed in the same position she held before the agency's allegedly improper actions. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Perfetto v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 454, &#x00B6; 17 (2000).

Department of Transportation</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 104, 107 (1996). We decline to address the issue of Ms. Spalding's placement on administrative leave in this stay extension order. OSC may raise issues of alleged noncompliance separately in a petition for enforcement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(b).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without much analysis, the Board stayed an indefinite suspension, apparently imposed as part of a security clearance review process, in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel ex rel. Gayl v. Dept. of Navy,</span> CB-1208-12-0001-U-1 (NP 10/13/2011), OSC noting that what was being challenged was a change in status (apparently from administrative leave):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...OSC emphasizes that it is not challenging the merits of the agency's suspension of Mr. Gayl's security clearance or asserting that Mr. Gayl has any right to be placed in a noncritical-sensitive position while he awaits a final agency decision on the merits of his security clearance suspension. Rather, OSC asserts that the stay request requires the Board only to review the merits of the Marine Corps' decision to change Mr. Gayl's pay status and determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the decision was made because of Mr. Gayl's protected whistleblowing activities.</p>
