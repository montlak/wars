<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-14"><span class="space">b.</span> Indirect Review Through Enforcement</h5>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417 (9th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> the court determined it lacked jurisdiction to review an FLRA decision denying exceptions to an arbitration award. The agency then declined to abide by the award, a ULP complaint was issued, and FLRA issued an order directing compliance with the award. The agency then sought review of the ensuing ULP decision to obtain a determination on the validity of the arbitration award. <span class="Italic">Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 1432, 1435-37 (9th Cir. 1985). All of this litigation, it is noted, concerned a shift change in 1978. The court declined to permit judicial review of a ULP finding, resulting from noncompliance with an award, to be converted into a means of indirect review of an arbitration award that itself did not involve a ULP determination:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Marshals Service argues that because Congress provided for judicial review when an action initially begins as an unfair labor practice charge, an unreviewable duty-to-bargain order enforcing an arbitration award becomes reviewable if the party seeking review defies the order and thereby commits an unfair labor practice. This roundabout way of obtaining appellate review of a nonreviewable arbitration award has little to commend it in terms of judicial economy. It also flies in the face of legislative intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The House-Senate Conference Committee Report addresses the compromise of House and Senate versions of &#x00A7; 7123(a) and specifically addresses congressional intent on jurisdiction to review an arbitrator's award or review of the FLRA's &#x00A7; 7122 decision via 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In the case of those other matters that are appealable to the Authority the conference report authorizes both the agency and the employee to appeal the final decision of the Authority except in two instances where the House recedes to the Senate. As in the private sector, there will be no judicial review of the Authority's determination of the appropriateness of bargaining units, and there will be no judicial review of the Authority's action on those arbitration awards in grievance cases which are appealable to the Authority. The Authority will only be authorized to review the award of the arbitrator on very narrow grounds similar to the scope of judicial review of an arbitrator's award in the private sector. In light of the limited nature of the Authority's review, the conferees determined it would be inappropriate for there to be subsequent review by the court of appeals in such matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the foregoing statement of legislative intent could have been more specific, it is difficult to argue that Congress intended to create another layer of appeal in these arbitration cases by permitting the review sought here. If we were to agree with the employing agency in this case, then every nonappealable arbitration award would automatically become appealable by the simple election to defy the order and then be found guilty of an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We need not decide whether the specific statute we are considering would...permit a court to strike down an order enforcing an award decision made in excess of delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition of the Act. No such problem confronts us here....&#8197;We do not study the question <span class="Italic">de novo</span> and compare the arbitrator's award with the award we might have made on the basis of briefs and arguments refined by the years of litigation the parties have employed in this case. We review the award only to determine whether an unfair labor practice was committed....</p>
<p class="noindent">But in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 521 F.3d 1148 (9th Cir. 2008), the Ninth Court considered an overtime case coming to it through a ULP finding of noncompliance with an arbitration award. The court examined the validity of the underlying arbitration award in the context of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, that is, the consent of the United States to a claim resting on the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Portal-to-Portal Act. The court enforced FLRA's determination that the agency committed a ULP when it failed to abide by the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the Second Circuit, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 792 F.2d 25, 27-29 (2d Cir. 1986), demonstrated that if the only ULP being reviewed is FLRA's determination that the agency failed to abide by an award, the court is unlikely to review the award on the merits:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although section 7123 gives us jurisdiction to review final orders of the FLRA, this section exempts two kinds of orders from appellate review: orders involving arbitral awards and orders on appropriate bargaining unit determinations. More specifically, however, section 7123(a)(1) states that an order under section 7122 (an award by an arbitrator) may not be reviewed in the court of appeals "<span class="Italic">unless</span> the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118...." (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency argues that section 7123(a) of the Statute permits indirect judicial review of an arbitral award where, as here, a final order involves an arbitral award <span class="Italic">and</span> an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2526"></span>Section 7123 must be read in conjunction with section 7122(a) and (b), section 7118 and section 7116. Under section 7122(a) either party to an arbitration may file with the Authority an exception to an arbitrator's award, as the Bureau of Prisons did in this case. Section 7122(a) allows that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If upon review the Authority finds that the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; <span class="Italic">or</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under subsection (b) of section 7122, "If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed...the award shall be final and binding." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b) (Supp. II 1984). Subsection (b) also requires that "(a)n agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Thus, Congress specifically provided that exceptions to arbitration awards are to be taken only to the Authority and that in the absence of such exceptions, the award shall be final and binding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other portions of the Statute relate to and complicate the resolution of this case.&#x2003;Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) of section 7118 set out the procedure to be followed by the FLRA in charging an agency with an unfair labor practice. Subsection (a)(7) of section 7118 outlines the Authority's enforcement power. Section 7116 lists what may constitute unfair labor practices by an agency under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interface of these sections of the Statute might seem to allow for indirect review of an arbitral award, as suggested by petitioners<span class="Italic">. See Council of Prison Locals v. Brewer</span>, 735 F.2d 1497, 1500 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Federal Services Impasses Panel decisions subject to indirect review). This is so because once the Authority issues an order in an unfair labor practice proceeding, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7), either party to a proceeding may seek review under section 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our examination of the Statute's language and of certain indicia of congressional intent set forth below, convince us that Congress meant to foreclose direct and indirect judicial review of Authority orders granting or denying exceptions to an arbitral award even when an unfair labor practice claim is later appended thereto.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two troubling voids in the statutory scheme: (1) section 7123(a)(1) does not spell out when the unfair labor practice must occur in order to fit within the section 7123(a)(1) exception (allowing judicial review of arbitral awards in unfair labor practice cases); (2) section 7122(b), while providing that failure to take an exception to an arbitral award within a thirty day period makes the award final and binding, it is silent on the effect of a denial of an exception to an award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the denial of the exceptions in this case made the award final and binding.&#x2003;We also conclude that in order for the arbitral award to fit within the section 7123(a)(1) exception and be subject to judicial review, the unfair labor practice must be part of the underlying controversy subject to arbitration, not some "after the fact" outgrowth of the refusal to abide by the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These conclusions are in accord with decisions of other circuits having occasion to review final orders of the Authority involving arbitral awards and unfair labor practices<span class="Italic">. United States Marshals Service v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1420 (9th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 675 F.2d 612, 613-14 (4th Cir. 1982). They are also supported by congressional intent as evidenced by the legislative history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that Congress intended to limit severely judicial review of arbitral decisions under the Statute.&#x2003;For example, section 7123(a)(1) states that the Authority's review is to be analogous to that of a federal court reviewing an arbitral award in the private sector....&#8197;The conference report on the Statute noted that it was the "intent of the House...to make it clear that the awards of arbitrators, when they become final, are not subject to further review by any other authority or administrative body..." H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 158 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News, 2860, 2892 (Conference Report). The House Report noted as well that "[o]nly those labor management relations matters specifically referred to in section 7123 shall be judicially reviewable." H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2nd Sess. 58 (1978) (House Report). It would make little sense for us to conclude that we should, in effect, "re-review" the Authority's decision here. As stated in the Conference Report: "In light of the limited nature of the Authority's review,...it would be inappropriate for there to be subsequent review by the court of appeals...." Conference Report at 153, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News at 2887. Thus, the language of the Conference Report, the House Report and the language of the Statute all suggest that the congressional intent was to preclude the scheme advocated by petitioner. Under that scheme, a party would file with the Authority an exception to the award and after the exception was denied would refuse to comply with the Authority's order. The party would thus become subject to an unfair labor practice charge that would open the door to judicial review of the merits of the underlying matter decided by the arbitrator. Thus, according to the agency, Congress intended section 7123(a) to allow us to do indirectly what it prevented us from doing directly under section 7123(a). We will not attribute such convoluted reasoning to the members of our national legislature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indirect review of an arbitral award also runs counter to public policy.&#x2003;The purpose of arbitration is to permit a relatively quick and inexpensive resolution of contract disputes by avoiding extended court proceedings<span class="Italic">. See Wilko v. Swan</span>, 346 U.S. 427, 431-32 (1953); <span class="Italic">Office of Supply v. New York Navigation Co.</span>, 469 F.2d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 1972). The policy in favor of quick and definite resolution is strong whether in the private sector,<span class="Italic"> see United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.</span>, 363 U.S. 574, 581-82 (1960), or the public sector,<span class="Italic"> see United States Marshals Service</span>, 708 F.2d at 1420. Indirect review would result in excessive delay and more expense, results clearly contrary to the general policy underlying arbitration awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that Congress intended to prohibit judicial oversight in these circumstances.&#x2003;Therefore, we reject petitioner's contention that indirect review of the arbitral award by this Court can be achieved by refusing to comply with the Authority's order upon section 7122 review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision whether to review the unfair labor practice order of the FLRA is controlled by our holding that we have no jurisdiction to review the arbitrator's award. That holding having been made, we deny the petition for review. There was substantial evidence to support the FLRA's finding that the agency had refused to comply with a final and binding arbitral award and consequently we grant the cross-petition for enforcement.<span class="Italic"> See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(8), 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 1409, 1415-16 (D.C. Cir. 1992), considered the doctrine of the "equitable discretion" of a court to decline enforcement of an award in the course of an FLRA judicial petition to enforce a ULP decision that upholds and enforces an award. The court was not taken with the concept:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's unfair labor practice orders are not self-enforcing. In cases like this one, the FLRA must apply to the federal courts for enforcement of its orders. SSA argues that we should exercise our equitable discretion and refuse to enforce the FLRA's order because of the peculiar circumstances of this case, i.e., that Arbitrator Smith significantly overstepped his authority under the agreement and that questions have been raised as to his impartiality. SSA's argument does not persuade.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Its "equity" argument relies heavily on Judge Posner's recent opinion in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. P*I*E Nationwide, Inc.</span>, 894 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1990). There, the Seventh Circuit also emphasized that the NLRB (like the FLRA) must go to a court of appeals and ask for an injunction to enforce its orders. In utilizing its equitable authority to issue injunctions in these cases, a court is not "disabl[ed] from exercising a complementary power of equitable restraint and forbearance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 893. Judge Posner, however, distinguished the permissible use of this power from discredited pre-New Deal "labor injunctions" by noting the constraints under which it should be exercised:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[W]e do not mean to suggest that the court is entitled to substitute its conception of equitable labor relations for that of Congress and the Board. The court must take as given the value choices embodied in the statutes and policies administered by the Board, but is entitled and in fact required to consider whether the enforcement of the Board's order would violate equitable principles that are neutral with regard to those value choices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. He would further cabin a court's discretion to refuse enforcement by requiring that a specific rule of equity, such as laches or harassment, support the refusal. In his words, "a modern federal equity judge does not have the discretion of a medieval Lord Chancellor to grant or withhold a remedy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SSA refers to only one case in our circuit in which equitable discretion has been discussed as a reason to deny enforcement.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Maywood Plant of Grede Plastics</span>, 628 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), we stated that "a court in its supervisory role may decline to enforce portions of a Board order that require affirmative action when that particular action has become futile at the time enforcement is sought." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 7. Obviously, that circumstance is not present here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if Judge Posner's somewhat broader rule were adopted as the law of this circuit, SSA has pointed to no particular rule of equity under which we should withhold enforcement once we find the FLRA's order to be reasonable. Indeed, we cannot ourselves identify any such rule to apply here or even conclude that the result in this case is necessarily inequitable. For unexplained reasons, OPM did not raise the issue of jurisdiction in its petition to the Federal Circuit. Had it done so, SSA might have attained the relief it now seeks. Holding the government to the consequences of that failure is not necessarily, in any jurisprudential sense, inequitable.</p>
<p class="noindent">A reviewing court will ensure that FLRA does not distort the underlying <span id="page_2527"></span>arbitration award through ULP enforcement proceedings, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 815 F.2d 797, 805-806 (1st Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the exercise of such unbridled authority by the ALJ is neither contemplated by the law nor justified by the circumstances, and constitutes an abuse of discretion by the FLRA within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 USC 706(2)(A)<span class="Italic">. See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe</span>, 401 U.S. 402, 413-16 (1970). By transforming examples into rigid requirements, and by failing to consider the totality of the remedial actions taken by the Shipyard in response to the arbitration award, the ALJ severely distorted the essence of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are at least two additional reasons by this Court should exercise jurisdiction and decline enforcement of the FLRA's order. First, the FLRA fatally misconstrues the arbitrator's ruling and nullifies specific provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. As previously indicated, the arbitrator's "clarification" of the union's request was to the effect that not all employees assigned to work on boats without respirators were entitled to the environmental pay differential. The arbitrator contemplated that asbestos could not be totally eliminated from the atmosphere, but could only be lowered to levels which would reduce or eliminate asbestos <span class="Italic">illness</span>. Yet the ALJ found that employees were entitled to environmental pay for <span class="Italic">potential</span> as well as actual <span class="Italic">exposure</span> to asbestos. This conclusion clearly misinterprets the award and Appendix J, which requires environmental pay for "expos(ure) of employees to <span class="Italic">potential illness</span>" (emphasis added), not potential <span class="Italic">exposure</span> of employees. Consistent with Appendix J, the arbitrator did <span class="Italic">not</span> require environmental pay for mere potential exposure of employees to asbestos, but only for exposure to <span class="Italic">potential illness</span>. The FLRA is thus abusing its discretion in seeking enforcement of a decision by an ALJ which misconstrues both the arbitrator's award and the contract. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the ALJ has rewritten the collective bargaining agreement in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A) in ruling that employees can ignore the provisions of Article 20, Section 3 of the agreement establishing the procedure for the claiming and payment of environmental pay. The ALJ concluded that following this procedure "would further complicate rather than expedite the process." That may be, but that procedure is what the parties bargained for. Certainly, the binding arbitration award to which the unfair labor practice charge was addressed neither required nor suggested any such shortcut. Environmental pay is a contractual creation, and an ALJ can no more overlook what the parties contracted as the method of enforcing the payment of environmental pay than he can ignore the existence of the other contract provisions upon which the payment of environmental pay is based. All parts of the contract must be applied as contemplated by the parties to the agreement, not as envisioned by a non-contractual third party. Such action by the ALJ is nothing short of legislation, and is contrary to established labor relations law<span class="Italic">. United Steelworkers of Am. v. Enterprise W. &#x0026; C. Corp.</span>, 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960) ("An arbitrator...does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the FLRA seeks to enforce a decision by the ALJ which allows the ALJ unbridled discretion in the interpretation of the arbitration award, misinterprets and misconstrues the award and the collective bargaining contract upon which it is based, and attempts to ignore specific provisions of that agreement. Having jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7123(a), we find such actions constitute an abuse of discretion by the FLRA within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). The request for enforcement of the order of the FLRA is <span class="Italic">denied</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As to any ambiguity in the implementation of the award, the parties should resort to the negotiated grievance procedure, <span class="Italic">see</span> Article 20, 3, to determine compliance with its terms, and the method for the distribution of EDP to those employees affected<span class="Italic">. Cf. Locals 2222, 2320-2327, Etc. v. New England, Etc.</span>, 628 F.2d 644, 649 (1st Cir. 1980) (case remanded to the original arbitration board to determine the remedy for a wrongful termination of employment).</p>
<p class="noindent">In the unusual case of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 685-91 (D.C. Cir. 1994), the court decided it had jurisdiction over a government petition to review FLRA's affirmance of an arbitrator's award that in turn determined that a regulation issued by the Customs Service violated a statute regulating coastal trade. The court essentially decided that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to review the application of a statute that did not affect working conditions, and that FLRA did not have jurisdiction to address the issue if the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction, i.e., FLRA could not avoid review of its decision sustaining an award the arbitrator lacked authority to make. The court did not provide much by way of legal precedent. The court seemed to conclude that it had inherent jurisdiction, as an appellate tribunal, to consider FLRA decisions involving arbitration awards resolving issues that are arguably (or demonstrably) outside the permissible scope of the statutory definition of a grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[In] <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury, United States Customs Serv. v. NTEU (Customs I), </span>43 F.L.R.A. No. 72 [,] [t]he Authority reasoned that "law" as used in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) had the same scope as the term "applicable law" under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the section of the Statute that sets forth the management prerogatives of covered federal agencies<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 4. Under that latter section, an agency acting "in accordance with applicable laws" is guaranteed authority, notwithstanding any provision of the FSLMRS, to make all major personnel decisions. Since the Authority had previously interpreted "applicable law" to "include[&#8197;] provisions of the U.S. Code, the U.S. Constitution, controlling judicial decisions, and Presidential Executive Orders," so long as they "relate to the conditions of employment of unit employees," <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union &#x0026; U.S. Dep't of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. 1333, 1337, 1338 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Bureau Pub. Debt</span>), it read "law" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) to have the same broad meaning. Nor was the term limited to "statutes that prescribe employee rights and benefits." <span class="Italic">Customs I</span>, 43 F.L.R.A. No. 72, at 4 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bureau Pub. Debt</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. at 1338). In short, there are no definitional constraints on the available grounds for grievances under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) other than that the law in question "affect" conditions of employment in some way in a particular circumstance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority remanded the case to the arbitrator, and, after being so instructed concerning the Statute's meaning, he determined that since the collective bargaining agreement defined a grievance in the same terms as did the Statute, the union had put forward an arbitrable dispute by alleging a violation of &#x00A7; 1448(a). On the merits, the arbitrator held that the CAPE program was inconsistent with &#x00A7; 1448(a) (and the Customs Service's own regulations) by virtue of having dispensed with boarding as an element of preliminary entry. To redress the violation, the arbitrator awarded back pay to the relevant customs officials in the amount that they would have earned but for the CAPE program; he also ordered the Customs Service "to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the future."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This time the Service appealed to the FLRA, arguing that &#x00A7; 1448(a) was not grievable under the FSLMRS and, alternatively, that the CAPE program did not violate that section of the customs laws. Without any deference to the Customs Service's interpretation of a law that Congress entrusted to the Service to enforce...the FLRA held that &#x00A7; 1448(a) plainly contemplated physical boarding as an aspect of preliminary entry. The Authority also dismissed the Service's argument that the arbitrator's award transgressed its management prerogatives under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of Treasury, United States Customs Serv. v. NTEU, </span>46 F.L.R.A. No. 137, 1439, 1443 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority's primary defense is jurisdictional. Neither we <span class="Italic">nor any court</span>, it is argued, has the power to review the FLRA's decision no matter what "law" the arbitrator and the Authority applied in the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's argument concerning our lack of subject matter jurisdiction is based on the express preclusion of judicial review set forth in &#x00A7; 7123(a) of the Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority <span class="Italic">other than</span> an order under--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;section 7122 of this title (involving an award by an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">may...institute an action for judicial review of the Authority's order....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have recognized that the merits of an arbitrator's award that implicates only the collective bargaining agreement are, by virtue of the categorical nature of this provision, absolutely immune from judicial review. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice v. FLRA, </span>981 F.2d 1339, 1342 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The Authority's role in reviewing such awards, by contrast, depends on the nature of the exception raised by the complaining party. If the arbitrator's decision is attacked "because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation," the Authority reviews the legal question <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1). If, on the other hand, the objection is not one of law, but of contract, the Authority's role is limited to that of "federal courts in private sector labor-management relations<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2)....&#8197;In either event the Authority is the final stop "unless the order involves an unfair labor practice." This case does not....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority contends, however, that to read &#x00A7; 7123(a) of the Statute to permit judicial review of an arbitrator's award when the FLRA seeks to enforce it would be to circumvent, indeed nullify, Congress' deliberate preclusion of judicial review of arbitrators' awards. Its position has been endorsed by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">United States Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 1432, 1435-36 (9th Cir. 1985), and the Second Circuit in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 792 F.2d 25, 27-28 (2d Cir. 1986), and we too agree with the Authority. It does not appear that either a federal agency or a public-sector union has any means to enforce an arbitrator's award other than to file an unfair labor practice charge....&#8197;In light of our holding that the district courts lack jurisdiction to review arbitration awards arising under the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see Griffith v. FLRA, </span>842 F.2d 487, 491 (D.C. Cir. 1988), it is doubtful that district courts have jurisdiction to enforce such awards--as they do in the private sector, where limited review is available. And surely <span id="page_2528"></span>it would have been senseless for Congress to preclude judicial review of arbitration awards <span class="Italic">except </span>when they are sought to be enforced by the only means available. Limiting judicial review under those conditions would be of no significance since an unenforceable award is a nullity, which no one would need or want to be reviewed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We must bear in mind, moreover, that the typical arbitrator's award interprets a collective bargaining agreement, and if at the enforcement stage we gained jurisdiction to review the FLRA's affirmance of the award, we would be obliged to review even rather minor applications of such agreements--a result Congress clearly wished to avoid. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, </span>981 F.2d at 1342; <span class="Italic">Griffith, </span>842 F.2d at 491.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, the phrase "involves an unfair labor practice" in &#x00A7; 7123(a) must have some meaning. We think Congress contemplated and was concerned about the sort of case that arises quite often in the private sector when an arbitrator's award is based in part on the unfair labor practice provisions of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Utility Workers Union v. NLRB, </span>39 F.3d 1210, 1216 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (arbitrator's decision may be deferred to in resolving unfair labor practice). In such a case, the FLRA's interpretation of the Act advanced in the process of reviewing the arbitrator's award would be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concluding, as we do, that our jurisdiction would not be enhanced if this dispute were to come to us as an agency petition for review of an unfair labor practice determination, we are obliged to consider carefully whether we have jurisdiction now because, if not now it would be, as the Authority argues, never. The Customs Service relies primarily on two rather unpersuasive arguments to establish our subject matter jurisdiction. The first is that the broad management rights section of the Statute, &#x00A7; 7106(a), which states that "nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency" to determine the agency's mission, somehow overrides the jurisdictional bar if judicial review is necessary to ensure the Service's right to determine its mission (i.e., if the FLRA has decided a case against the government). That would mean that if both a federal agency and a union were dissatisfied with an FLRA opinion upholding an arbitrator's interpretation of a statute, we would have jurisdiction over only the issues presented in the agency's petition. That seems to us to be a labored, even silly, construction of the statute. There is not the slightest indication that Congress intended such an asymmetrical construction of its limitation on judicial review--or, indeed, that the substantive provision of the management rights clause would have any applicability to the provision precluding judicial review....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also wide of the mark is the Service's reliance on <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. 184, 79 S. Ct. 180, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958), to circumvent the statutory preclusion. <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> stands for the proposition that if an agency openly violates a clear mandate of a statute even a preclusion of judicial review (in that case implied) will not bar judicial intervention. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 188-91, 79 S. Ct. 183-85. There is no such clear transgress of a substantive statutory mandate here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The key question presented, as we see the case, is the proper scope of &#x00A7; 7123(a)'s express preclusion of judicial review. Can it be that the FLRA's interpretation of any "law"--including the Constitution, judicial decisions, or any statute--is immune from judicial review?....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It seems clear to us that &#x00A7; 7123(a) (the preclusion of judicial review of arbitrated disputes) must be read in light of &#x00A7; 7103(a) (the definition of permissible grounds for grievances). Congress obviously assumed in drafting the former provision that an arbitrator would never have occasion to interpret a law that did not affect working conditions. The term "affecting working conditions," in turn, must have been thought to impose a real limitation on an arbitrator's authority. The FLRA's construction of that phrase would, however, deprive it of any limiting principle. Absolutely any law could under some circumstances have some adverse consequences on the working conditions of one or more employees. The Authority's definition thus does not restrict the <span class="Italic">category </span>of laws that may be brought to arbitration, but only suggests that a law may be the subject of a grievance if an employee is somehow aggrieved by its application--which in essence reduces the limitation to a standing requirement. We think, rather, that a "law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment" can be only interpreted, as it initially was by the arbitrator in this case, to confine grievances to alleged violations of a statute or regulation that can be said to have been issued for the very purpose of affecting the working conditions of employees--not one that merely incidentally does so. Once the &#x00A7; 7103(a) language is given that meaning it becomes apparent that a "grievance" predicated on a claim of violation of a law that is not directed toward employee working conditions is outside both the arbitrator's and the FLRA's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The very preclusion of judicial review suggests powerfully that Congress could not have contemplated, let alone intended, that all or any part of American law would be definitively interpreted by the FLRA on review of one or a series of cases originally put to arbitration. To give any administrative tribunal such final authority to construe any or all statutes or treaties of the United States would be a staggering delegation, which surely would have provoked considerable congressional debate. That Congress would entrust such sweeping authority to a minor three-member commission with quite restricted expertise is, when one ponders the matter, utterly inconceivable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority was led into its farfetched, if self-serving, misconstruction of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) (the definition of grievance) by effectively equating the phrase "law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment" with the term "applicable laws" in the management rights section. The latter provision, as we have noted, ensures that an agency acting in "accordance with applicable laws" may make virtually all the most important decisions respecting personnel matters without regard to any provision of the entire FSLMRS....&#8197;This is not to say that the FLRA does not have authority to reject an agency's interpretation of a law applicable to certain personnel actions covered under &#x00A7; 7106(a). But--and it is a big but--a dispute between an agency and the FLRA concerning an interpretation of a law applicable to the exercise of management prerogatives will almost always arise in a negotiability case or unfair labor practice proceedings, and, following the statutory design for such questions, may ultimately be brought to a federal court of appeals. Accordingly, there was no reason for Congress to limit "applicable laws" in &#x00A7; 7106 as it did "law, rule, or regulation" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) to those that affect (are directed to) working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the arbitrator essentially got it right the first time. A grievance claiming a "violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a law, rule, or regulation" may be brought under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii) (assuming the relevant agreement tracks the statutory definition) if the particular legal authority relied upon was fashioned for the purpose of regulating the working conditions of employees. Our review is available for the limited purpose of determining whether the Authority exceeds its jurisdiction. Having determined that it did so here, we grant the petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a similar appeal brought by the union to review an FLRA decision setting aside an award favoring the union relating to the customs inspectors' overtime pay, the Ninth Circuit rejected the D.C. Circuit's theory of indirect judicial review of decisions on exceptions to arbitration awards, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 112 F.3d 402, 404-406 (9th Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject NTEU's and the Customs Service's argument that the presumption of judicial review should overcome the clear statutory language of &#x00A7; 7123. In <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. OPM</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 105 S. Ct. 1620, 84 L. Ed.2d 674 (1985), the Supreme Court stated that access to judicial review should be limited "only upon a showing of 'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 778, 105 S. Ct. at 1626. However, the Court also noted that this presumption of judicial review "has never turned on a talismanic test<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 778-79, 105 S. Ct. at 1627. "Rather, the question whether a statute precludes judicial review 'is determined not only from its express language, but also from the structure of the statutory scheme, its objectives, its legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action involved.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 779, 105 S. Ct. at 1627 (quoting <span class="Italic">Block v. Community Nutrition Inst., </span>467 U.S. 340, 345, 104 S. Ct. 2450, 2453-54, 81 L. Ed.2d 270 (1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject NTEU's and the Customs Service's reliance on <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury v. FLRA ("Treasury"), </span>43 F.3d 682 (D.C. Cir. 1994), which held that courts of appeals have jurisdiction to review the FLRA's determination of its own jurisdiction. We are not persuaded by the D.C. Circuit's opinion and therefore decline to follow it. The language of &#x00A7; 7123 is clear--judicial review of the FLRA's decision regarding an arbitrator's award is precluded unless it involves an unfair labor practice. The arbitrator's award in the present case, as in the D.C. Circuit case, does not involve an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unpersuaded by the D.C. Circuit's argument that Congress couldn't have intended section 7123 to be enforced as written. According to the D.C. Circuit, it's "utterly inconceivable" that Congress would make such a "staggering delegation" of interpretive authority to the FLRA. 43 F.3d at 690. To begin with, we find "utterly inconceivable" arguments a poor substitute for clear statutory language. In any event, we do not read the delegation of authority to the FLRA as quite so broad as perceived by our D.C. Circuit colleagues, nor do we view the congressional decision to preclude judicial review of certain FLRA orders as quite so extraordinary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the D.C. Circuit went astray is in thinking that by precluding judicial review "all or any part of American law would be <span class="Italic">definitively interpreted </span>by the FLRA<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (emphasis added). This concern is, of course, unfounded. The FLRA only has the authority to determine the implications of such laws on labor relations; the agency is not forced to conform its substantive actions to the FLRA's interpretation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering whether it was "utterly inconceivable" for Congress to have denied courts the power to intervene, we deem it significant that this is an intramural dispute between two executive branch agencies and executive branch employees. We do not find it at all inconceivable for <span id="page_2529"></span>Congress to have decided that the executive branch should work out its internecine disputes without interference from the judicial branch. After all, everyone involved in this dispute is ultimately answerable to the President who has various informal remedies available if he is dissatisfied with FLRA decisions--such as refusing to reappoint members when their terms expire. It's thus quite likely that Congress intended just what it said--that the judicial branch stay out of the business of reviewing FLRA decisions involving an arbitration award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As well, we find the D.C. Circuit's statutory construction effort strained. The D.C. Circuit claims that section 7123(a), which bars review of FLRA decisions "involving an award by an arbitrator," must be read in conjunction with section 7103(a)(9), which defines permissible grounds for a "grievance." According to the D.C. Circuit, because an arbitrator's award must involve a "grievance," Congress only intended to bar appeals of FLRA decisions to the extent they involve a "grievance." <span class="Italic">See </span>43 F.3d at 689. We note, however, that Congress left the definition of "grievance" vague--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, "any claimed violation...of any law...affecting conditions of employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii). The D.C. Circuit's interpretation therefore requires us to infer congressional intent from an ambiguous statutory provision--the definition of "grievance"--to override a clear statutory command: the bar on judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Congress knew that "an award by an arbitrator" would involve more than just the resolution of a "grievance." Congress specified that "procedures for the settlement of grievances" must include the resolution of "<span class="Italic">questions of arbitrability</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (emphasis added). As a result, when Congress barred review of FLRA decisions "involving an award by an arbitrator," it also necessarily barred review of FLRA decisions involving questions of arbitrability, including whether a law "affect[s] conditions of employment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the D.C. Circuit is exaggerating the threat of overreaching by the FLRA. If the FLRA acts "in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific [statutory] prohibition," district courts have jurisdiction to intervene under <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. 184, 188, 79 S. Ct. 180, 183-84, 3 L. Ed.2d 210 (1958).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the arbitrator's award in the present case does not involve an unfair labor practice, the FLRA's decision regarding the award is not subject to judicial review. This appeal is therefore dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
