<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-11"><span class="space">a.</span> Unfair Labor Practice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7116 makes it an unfair labor practice for an agency to discharge or otherwise discipline an individual for union activities. Ordinarily, labor arbitrators or the Federal Labor Relations Authority concern themselves with unfair labor practice allegations, but should those allegations arise in a case otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Board--a performance-based or adverse action--FLRA has no authority to either review a Board decision or an arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(a) and 5 USC 7121(f). That leaves the Board, with no particular expertise in federal sector labor law, in the position of deciding affirmative defenses involving ULP allegations in the course of an appeal it receives directly or through a request for review of an arbitration award involving an otherwise appealable action based on a grievance that raises an allegation of discrimination in addition to whatever else the grievance may assert. Sound complex? It is. [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's first treatment of unfair labor practice issues, normally raised through an allegation of reprisal for union activities, appears in <span class="Italic">Kuahine v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 346, 347, 4 MSPB 408 (1980). The Board did not discuss the underlying facts, but stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that the agency had not committed an unfair labor practice under the circumstances of the case. The Board does not have jurisdiction to decide allegations of unfair labor practices, and, to the extent that the initial decision implied jurisdiction, we find its holding overly broad. It is not our intention here to foreclose the possibility that such an allegation might be raised and considered as an affirmative defense of an appellant. However, in this case, the initial decision should reflect the limits of the jurisdiction granted to this Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gragg v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 296, 298, 11 MSPB 546 (1982) ("It is now settled that appellants may raise an allegation of an unfair labor practice as an affirmative defense in actions brought before the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was later suggested that the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal requesting it to consider, independently of an appealable action, the claim that an employee was subjected to an agency unfair labor practice under 5 USC 7116. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 135, 136 n.1 (1983). In <span class="Italic">Clarry v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 147, 153 (1983), the Board concluded that it lacks jurisdiction to determine whether an agency action constitutes an unfair labor practice, citing <span class="Italic">Polk v. IRS</span>, 11 MSPR 482, 483 (1982) ("Board does not have the jurisdiction to determine whether...violation of a union agreement constitutes an unfair labor practice under 5 USC 7116"), and <span class="Italic">Bodinus v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 536, 7 MSPB 385, 388 (1981), a result confirmed in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Small</span>, 840 F.2d 972 (D.C. Cir. 1988)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 676, 678 (1986) (Board has no authority to determine whether an action constitutes an unfair labor practice). However, <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span> has a twist: although the Board may not adjudicate an unfair labor practice, it may reckon with a prohibited personnel practice encompassing the same conduct, i.e., reprisal against personnel involved in providing representation in the course of appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haataja v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 594, 605 n.13 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span>, 7 MSPR 536, 541-42 (1981)). In <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span>, the AJ improperly excluded evidence that might have shown that the appellant was treated adversely as to work load and evaluation due to protected union activities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 1, 2-3 (1984) (AJ considered a union animus theory, but found against the appellant because the agency's treatment of him, compared with his coworkers, was justified by the dissimilarity of the offenses). In <span class="Italic">Triplett v. DLA</span>, 19 MSPR 93, 96 (1984), the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9) by removing the appellant in reprisal for use of a negotiated grievance procedure. An agency manager openly admitted that the appellant was perceived as a "trouble maker." [Refer to <span class="Italic">Ireland v. DHHS, SSA</span>, 34 MSPR 614 (1987), in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-224.html#sec13-216">Reprisal Against Individual Involved in Union Activity</a>."] The Board will not apply an unfair labor practice or remedy to an appellant's allegation that an agency violated its duty to supply information to a union under 5 USC 7114 during a grievance arbitration decision reviewed by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fearon v. Dept. of Labor,</span> 99 MSPR 428, 430 n.1 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Where does this leave us? Perhaps the Board is saying that it will not and cannot decide an unfair labor practice issue as a matter of law--ensuring that only the Federal Labor Relations Authority or labor arbitrators need be concerned about problems of ULP remedies, compliance, and judicial review. But the Board is saying that it will adjudicate the same conduct, provide a full remedy to the complainant (appellant), and call it a prohibited personnel practice or perhaps a mitigating factor. The lesson is: if there is a concern that an appellant has been victimized by an unfair labor practice, and the Board is to adjudicate it, call the defense something else and proceed apace. If, as an agency representative, you find the appeal to be requesting relief for an unfair labor practice, object and move to strike that defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 885-90 (4th Cir. 1992) (discussed in <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>). Note, however, that a report of action constituting an unfair labor practice could be a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Protection Act, raising the possibility of an IRA claim or an affirmative defense that is predicated, indirectly, on a violation of federal-sector labor law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devera v.

<p class="Body-Text">In a 1995 decision, FLRA ceded to the MSPB the authority to decide unfair labor practice issues that are or could be raised in adverse actions appealed to the Board, <span class="Italic">SBA and Wildberger</span>, 51 FLRA 413, 418-22 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This consolidated case presents the Authority with an opportunity to reexamine previous Authority precedent interpreting the statutory bar set forth in the first sentence of section 7116(d): "Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section." Our review is prompted by the decision of the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, in which the court reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Census I</span> [41 FLRA 436 (1991)], and held that a record of infraction and letter of proposed removal were inseparable from an employee's subsequent challenge to a removal before MSPB and that the MSPB had sole jurisdiction to consider the merits of any challenge to these actions. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 888.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons more fully explained below, we find that we lack jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaints in this case because the same factual predicate and legal theories underlie each unfair labor practice complaint and Wildberger's challenge of his removal before the MSPB. Accordingly, we dismiss the unfair labor practice complaints in this consolidated case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Precedent</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, as relevant here, an individual filed an unfair labor practice charge challenging the agency's reference to protected activities in a record of infraction and a letter of proposed removal issued to him. The Authority determined that the question presented was whether "issues presented in the ULP proceeding are the same as the issues that could have been raised under the statutory appeal procedure...." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 445. If so, "then section 7116(d) would preclude the matter from being raised in the unfair labor practice proceeding." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the jurisdictional bar in the first sentence of section 7116(d) was inapplicable in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, the Authority relied on <span class="Italic">U.S. Dept. of the Army</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411</span>, 38 FLRA 1345 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176 (D.C. Cir. 1992) <span class="Italic">(Army Finance). Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 447. In <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, the Authority had developed a test for determining whether the jurisdictional bar in the second sentence of section 7116(d)[6] applied, i.e., whether the issues raised in an arbitration proceeding are the same as the issues that are raised in the unfair labor practice charge. <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1351. In adapting the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test to the <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span> case, the Authority held that the jurisdictional bar in the first sentence in section 7116(d) would correspondingly be invoked if "the subject matter of an unfair labor practice charge is the same, in terms of the factual predicate and theory, as the subject matter of a grievance." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 446-47 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The second sentence of section 7116(d) states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except for matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test to the facts presented in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, a scenario which implicated the first sentence of section 7116(d), the Authority held that the unfair labor practice allegation was not barred by the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 447. Although the Authority found that the factual predicate of the unfair labor practice charge might also have been a basis of the final removal action, the Authority concluded that the theory of the unfair labor practice charge was different from the theory applicable to review of the final removal action because the unfair labor practice charge presented issues relating to the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal--matters that are not subject to review in a statutory appeals procedure. Consequently, two distinct sections of Title 5 of the United States Code provided the basis for the respective legal theories. The unfair labor practice charge was premised on a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, whereas the removal implicated 5 USC 7701. Thus, the Authority found the statutory bar inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Section 7116(d) Statutory Bar</span> <span class="Italic">in the Commerce Decision</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3140"></span>On appeal to the Fourth Circuit, the court reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, and determined that the first sentence of section 7116(d) barred the Authority from asserting jurisdiction over the record of infraction and a notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 888.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court agreed with the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(d) as articulated in <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>. However, the court disagreed with the Authority's application in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>. Specifically, the court rejected the Authority's finding that the underlying legal theories supporting the unfair labor practice charge and the removal action were different. The court stated that the employee could raise the same legal arguments before the MSPB that he could raise in an unfair labor practice allegation before the Authority. In this connection, an employee may challenge the agency's actions as a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 USC 2302. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 890. Thus, the court held that a proposed adverse personnel action may not be separated from an actual adverse personnel action when both are based on the same underlying facts and legal theories. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 889.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court reasoned that its holding was consistent with the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and its legislative history. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 885. The court noted that in enacting the CSRA, Congress sought to replace a "'patchwork' system of laws governing [F]ederal employment" that "sometimes [led] to confusing and contradictory results" with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of [F]ederal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (<span class="Italic">citing United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 445 (1988)). In the court's view, under the CSRA scheme of adjudication, Congress intended that the jurisdiction of the Authority and MSPB be limited to distinct employment-related matters. The court pointed out that under Chapter 71 of the CSRA, the Authority adjudicates issues that relate to employees' rights to engage in union-related activities; the MSPB, on the other hand, is responsible for adjudicating employees' appeals from various types of adverse personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such adverse actions include, among other things, a removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court made two additional points. First, it stated that "[n]othing...prevents employees from lodging ULP charges to complain about unfair disciplinary actions. Only where those initial disciplinary actions ripen into full-blown 'adverse employment actions' will sole jurisdiction vest in the MSPB under the first sentence of 7116(d)." <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 890. Second, the court found that the employee's ULP "charge focused on his individual right and thus was essentially the same as his later grievance under the MSPB procedure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 889. As a result, the ULP allegation did not address the union's institutional interests. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Clarification of the Test to Determine If the Section 7116(d) Bar Applies</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> decision, we take this opportunity to clarify how the Authority will apply its <span class="Italic">Army</span> <span class="Italic">Finance</span> test in cases analogous to <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>. Where an employee has attempted to raise related issues both in an unfair labor practice proceeding and under either an appeals procedure or a negotiated grievance procedure, we will apply the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test in order to determine whether to invoke the jurisdictional bars set forth in section 7116(d). We will examine the subject matter of the ULP charge to determine if the factual predicate and legal theory are the same as the matter raised in the appeals procedure or grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this examination, however, we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span> insofar as that decision held that the legal theories upon which an unfair labor practice allegation is based are different from the legal theories underlying a removal proceeding before the MSPB merely because different statutory review provisions are applicable in each instance. The <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> decision held that the legislative history underlying the enactment of the CSRA discussed above--to avoid potentially inconsistent results between Authority and MSPB decisions--compels this determination. As the Fourth Circuit noted, an employee may raise an affirmative defense before the MSPB that the agency committed a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 USC 2302. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 890. We agree with the Fourth Circuit and conclude that in some circumstances the same legal theory that can be raised as a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 USC 2302(b)(9) can also be raised as an "unfair labor practice" under 5 USC 7116(a). Accordingly, when the factual predicate of the ULP and the statutory appeal is the same, and the legal theory supporting the statutory appeal has been or could properly be raised to the MSPB, we will decline to assert jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice pursuant to section 7116(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, we will apply this rule only in cases when the matter raised in the ULP allegation ripens into or is inseparable from the matter appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 889-90. Additionally, unlike the Authority's statutory jurisdiction to review unfair labor practice allegations of, and grant relief to, individuals <span class="Italic">and</span> labor organizations, 5 USC 7103(a)(1) &#x0026; 7118(a)(1), (7), the MSPB's statutory jurisdiction is limited, under 5 USC 7701(a) &#x0026; (b)(2)(A), to reviewing appeals by, and granting relief to, employees or applicants. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("[I]t would be contrary to the plain and unequivocal language of [5 USC 7701(a)] to say that the term 'employee'...encompasses a labor organization[.] "). Accordingly, we will decline jurisdiction in cases where the ULP focuses on the rights of an individual employee; conversely, we will assert jurisdiction when the ULP focuses on the union's institutional interest in protecting the rights of other employees. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 889; <span class="Italic">cf. Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1353 (construing and applying second sentence of section 7116(d), where individual employee is actually the aggrieved party in the ULP action, employee cannot maintain separate action in the form of a grievance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 885-90 (4th Cir. 1992), reviewing a decision of the FLRA, determined that the Board is empowered to deal with lesser personnel actions, such as a record of infraction and an adverse action proposal, that were bound up in an action within the Board's jurisdiction--a removal decision--that raised an issue of reprisal for union activities.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board avoided a ULP issue--whether an agency improperly implemented a furlough without completing impact bargaining--when it decided that the agency acted with legal authority, <span class="Italic">Austin IRS Consolidation and Dept. of Treasury</span>, DA-0752-13-4730-I-1 (NP 12/22/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellants challenge the administrative judge's finding that it is beyond the Board's scope of review to consider their claim that the agency committed an unfair labor practice by implementing the furlough before bargaining was complete. The appellants assert that, on December 4, 2014, before the initial decisions were issued, an arbitrator's award found that the agency committed an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116, "Unfair labor practices," and a specific provision of the National Agreement by unilaterally implementing the 3 furlough days on IRS bargaining unit employees prior to the completion of bargaining with NTEU. The appellants reason that the agency's action was therefore not in accordance with law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C) and cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), an "agency's decision may not be sustained...if the employee or applicant for employment shows that the decision was not in accordance with law." To succeed in a not-in-accordance-with-law defense, an appellant must establish that there is no legal authority for the action. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 486, 488-89 (1993). That is, the Board must determine whether the decision itself, in its entirety, was not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 683 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Handy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). Here, the appellants acknowledge that the basis of the unfair labor practice claim and the arbitrator's decision was the agency's implementation of the 3 specific furlough days before the completion of bargaining with NTEU. The appellants have not demonstrated, nor do they even assert, that the agency's legal authority to take the furlough action was an issue presented to the arbitrator or that it was the basis for his finding that the agency committed an unfair labor practice. Therefore, there is no showing that the arbitrator's decision established that the agency lacked the legal authority to furlough the appellants. Moreover, the Board has held that the scheduling of an agency's furlough action is not a matter within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, <span class="Italic">Pumphrey v. Department of Defense</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 186, &#x00B6; 13 (2015), and that the implementation of a furlough is generally left to the agency's discretion, <span class="Italic">see Lopez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17 (2014); <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6; 9 (2013).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the Board's historical reluctance to consider unfair labor practice issues directly connected with adverse actions, it can be understood that the Board is even less likely to carefully consider the effects of lesser misconduct. In a decision noting the possibility of wrongdoing related to a supervisory meeting that excluded the appellant's union representative, the Board stated that any impropriety that occurred would fall outside the scope of the Board's review. <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 334, 343 (1987). Considering the contention that an employee was deprived of adequate notice of an adverse action because she would not accept the notice without a union representative, the Board briefly examined the law and found no requirement that the employer allow the representative to be present when the notice was presented to the employee. <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 319, 325 (1989) (right to union representation is limited to situations where an employee reasonably believes that an investigation will lead to discipline).
