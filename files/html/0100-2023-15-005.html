<h3 class="h3" id="sec7-6"><span class="space">A.</span> DIRECTED INTEREST ARBITRATION</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 31 FLRA 1123, 1126-27 (1988), affirmed the Panel's use of directed interest arbitration to settle bargaining disputes:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7119(b) provides that parties have two alternatives if they are unable to resolve their impasse through mediation: (1) they may request that the Panel consider the matter; or (2) they may agree to adopt a procedure for binding interest arbitration, but only if the procedure is approved by the Panel. Under these provisions, parties may use binding interest arbitration to resolve their impasse rather than request Panel assistance. The Panel, however, must approve the parties' procedure. This requirement for Panel approval before the parties may use binding interest arbitration is the only restriction on the use of binding interest arbitration expressed in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When parties request the Panel to consider their impasse, section 7119(c)(5)(A) provides that the Panel shall investigate and consider the impasse. After investigation and consideration, the Panel can either recommend procedures for the resolution of the impasse or the Panel can assist the parties in resolving the impasse. Under section 7119(c)(5)(B), if the parties do not resolve their impasse through Panel-recommended procedures or Panel assistance, the Panel is authorized to take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with the Statute to resolve the impasse. Under section 7119(c)(5)(C), the action taken by the Panel constitutes the Panel's "final action" on the impasse and is binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These provisions are plainly worded and, in our view, indicate that the Panel is authorized to direct parties to use binding interest arbitration to resolve their impasse. Nothing in the Statute restricts that power. Although the Panel must consider an impasse which has been referred to it, the Panel is not compelled to provide direct assistance for resolution of the impasse. Under section 7119(c)(5)(A), the Panel is authorized to recommend procedures to the parties rather than provide assistance. When the impasse is not resolved under the Panel's recommended procedures, the Panel is authorized to direct the parties to use binding interest arbitration. This is the procedure used by the Panel in this case. The Panel is also authorized to direct parties to use binding interest arbitration when an impasse is not resolved after direct Panel assistance. In both instances, the Panel may take final action by directing the parties to use binding interest arbitration to resolve the impasse and that action would be binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered nothing was inappropriate concerning directed arbitration to resolve an impasse over a wage dispute exempted from the Reform Act by the savings clause of the Act. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, W. Area Power Admin. and IBEW, Gov't Coordinating Council</span>, 25 FLRA 1090, 1096-97 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Panel's authority to direct dispute resolution to a private arbitrator was confirmed in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10 (1993), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part</span>, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA noted the right of an interest arbitrator to then resolve the dispute in any manner consistent with the authority of the Panel, 47 FLRA at 17-18:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7119(b)(1) of the Statute empowers the Panel to direct parties to use interest arbitration to resolve negotiation impasses. <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 37 FLRA at 1354-57. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, we specifically reaffirmed the Panel's authority to designate a private, outside arbitrator and noted that section 7119 "expressly authorizes the Panel to take whatever action it deems necessary to resolve an impasse[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. In addition, under section 7119(c)(5)(ii) of the Statute, the Panel is authorized to resolve an impasse "through whatever methods and procedures,...it may consider appropriate." In this regard, the Panel "is empowered to take whatever action is necessary to resolve an impasse, including ordering parties to agree to specific proposed language." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 83 and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 415 (1990). The Arbitrator in this case was selected by the parties under the Panel's direction and, in our opinion, possessed the same authority to resolve the parties' dispute as the Panel. We find no basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator was limited in any manner in resolving the parties' dispute concerning performance appraisal issues. Accordingly, we reject the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the ensuing litigation over the <span class="Italic">POPA</span> decision, the reviewing court made clear one significant limitation on the jurisdiction of an interest arbitrator appointed through FSIP procedures. Because the FSIP exists to resolve impasses, its interest arbitrator cannot consider proposals that are not impassed. The interest arbitrator should not entertain proposals submitted for the first time to the arbitrator and not previously bargained to impasse between the parties, <span class="Italic">POPA v. FLRA</span>, 26 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (D.C. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arises from a dispute between the Patent and Trademark Office, Department of Commerce ("PTO" or "Agency"), and the Patent Office Professional Association ("POPA" or "Union") over the negotiability of proposed contract provisions covering employee performance appraisals. At issue here is a decision by the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("Authority") under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-35 (1988) ("FSLMRS" or "Statute"), upholding the jurisdiction of an interest arbitrator and addressing the negotiability of forty-eight performance appraisal proposals that were awarded by the interest arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">PTO and POPA first submitted their dispute to an interest arbitrator, after having reached an impasse over various proposals, including some that involved the evaluation of employees under a comprehensive performance appraisal plan. The arbitrator resolved many of the outstanding issues, but withheld action on the performance appraisal proposals pending resolution of their negotiability by the Authority. The Authority eventually issued its decision on the negotiability questions, and the bargaining process was set to continue. The Union then submitted a revised package of performance appraisal proposals. Many of the proposals included in the revised package had not been previously presented by the Union to PTO for negotiation. The Agency refused to bargain over most of the new proposals on the grounds that they were either nonnegotiable or untimely. The Union responded by filing an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority, which was dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Undeterred, the Union submitted the entire package of revised proposals (including both the new proposals and those that already had been on the negotiating table) to the interest arbitrator, who proceeded with a hearing. The Agency refused to participate in the hearing, insisting that the existence of a bargaining impasse was a precondition to the exercise of the arbitrator's authority; on this point, PTO asserted that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the new proposals because the parties had never bargained over those proposals. Over the Agency's objections, the interest arbitrator issued an award that included several of the newly presented proposals. The arbitrator directed that his award be included as "Article 19" of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. PTO's Acting Director for Personnel disapproved Article 19 in its entirety, and the Union, in turn, filed a negotiability appeal with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority addressed several issues in its decision.&#x2003;First, it rejected the Agency's contention that the interest arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to award Article 19. Second, the Authority expressly declined to consider the Agency's duty-to-bargain objections to the new proposals, stating that those questions would have to be resolved in some other "appropriate proceeding."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Agency is now stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place: having lost before an interest arbitrator with respect to matters not within his jurisdiction and having lost before the Authority in part on the grounds that the arbitrator did have jurisdiction and that the disputed provisions are included in the parties' agreement, the Agency is now left with the Authority's incomprehensible suggestion that, to the extent that issues still exist, they should be resolved in some unidentified "other appropriate proceedings." The Authority's purported resolution of this case is not only inane, it is patently unfair.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Interest Arbitrator's Jurisdiction</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fortunately, the confusion engendered by the Authority's handling of this case is largely dissipated by our conclusion that the interest arbitrator lacked jurisdiction to award the proposals over which PTO claims it has no duty to bargain. This group of proposals consists of numbers 20, 23, 24, 26, and 42. Because these proposals were awarded in the absence of jurisdiction we hold that they are <span class="Italic">not</span> part of Article 19, regardless of their negotiability which we address below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interest arbitrator in this case was engaged at the direction of the Panel, and his authority is coterminous with that of the Panel. <span class="Italic">See Department of Defense Dependents Sch. v. FLRA</span>, 852 F.2d 779, 784 (4th Cir. 1988) ("The idea that a 'designee' of the Impasses Panel should have any other or different or even greater authority than that of the panel is...without authorization."). The Panel--and by delegation, the arbitrator--enjoys the latitude to "take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with [the Statute] to resolve the impasse," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5)(B)(iii), including the power unilaterally to impose contract terms on the parties. The Authority believed that the arbitrator's broad remedial authority empowered him to reach all the disputed proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What the Authority totally overlooked was that before the Panel can employ its power, <span class="Italic">there must first be an impasse</span>. The Statute allows the Panel, and by designation the arbitrator, "to provide assistance in resolving <span id="page_1183"></span><span class="Italic">negotiation impasses</span> between agencies and exclusive representatives." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7119(c)(1) (1988). The Statute does not define a "negotiation impasse," but the Authority's regulations define the term to mean</p>
<p class="noindent-2">that point...at which the parties are <span class="Italic">unable to reach agreement notwithstanding their efforts to do so by direct negotiations</span> and by the use of mediation or other voluntary arrangements for settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2470.2(e) (1994) (emphasis added). Clearly, the Panel's jurisdiction is premised on the parties being "unable to reach agreement, notwithstanding their efforts to do so." Indeed, the Panel is obligated to "[d]ecline to assert jurisdiction in the event that it finds that no impasse exists<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2471.6(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is indisputable that the parties never bargained over several of the new proposals included in the revised package that the Union submitted to the interest arbitrator.&#x2003;Of these, proposals 20, 23, 24, 26, and 42 became part of Article 19. The Agency had refused to negotiate over these proposals with the Union, asserting duty-to-bargain and negotiability objections. In fact, the Union had filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Agency (which the Authority dismissed as untimely) precisely because PTO had refused to bargain. Clearly, when the interest arbitrator turned his attention to these particular proposals, the parties had never negotiated over them, let alone reached an impasse, and thus the arbitrator had no authority to award these proposals as part of the contract.[2] Therefore, as to proposals 20, 23, 24, 26, and 42, the Authority committed reversible error in ruling that the interest arbitrator had jurisdiction to consider these proposals and in holding that any of the proposals found to be negotiable were part of Article 19 of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The Agency's refusal to bargain cannot be construed as an impasse which the arbitrator could rightfully resolve. The Agency's refusal to bargain was premised not merely on a disagreement with the proposals, but on a threshold claim that the proposals were not negotiable. So long as these negotiability issues remained unresolved, coupled with the parties' resulting failure to negotiate over the merits of the proposals, there could be no impasse on the merits. Thus, there was nothing to be considered by the interest arbitrator, for it is well-established that an interest arbitrator cannot resolve negotiability issues<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Department of Justice, INS v. FLRA, </span>995 F.2d 46, 48 (5th Cir. 1993); AFGE, 778 F.2d at 854.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA</span> applies in the context of negotiations. Nothing requires a bargaining impasse before rights arbitration is invoked under a collective bargaining contract. <span class="Italic">VAMC N. Chicago and AFGE Local 2107</span>, 52 FLRA 387, 394 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">It is when FSIP acts as an interest arbitrator, or when it directs interest arbitration by another arbitrator, that confusion has developed about the reviewability of the resulting interest arbitration award--an award that will essentially write some or all of a contract. The issue of whether the ensuing award or Panel order that functions as an award is reviewable through agency-head review under 5 USC 7117(c) and a union negotiability appeal, or through the process of exceptions filed to an arbitration award was difficult to resolve. The result, after much litigation, is that the Panel award or Panel-directed award is reviewable through the negotiability process following agency-head review under &#x00A7; 7117(c). [The subject of agency-head review of interest awards issued by or at the direction of FSIP is covered in Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-028.html#sec4-29">Disapproval of Agreement Imposed by FSIP or Interest Arbitrator</a>."]</p>
