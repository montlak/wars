<p class="Body-Text">Disciplinary action cannot be based on the approved leave, although even approved leave may lead to removal if absence is excessive under defined circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scorcia v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 588, 590 (1998) ("As a general rule...an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking an adverse action on the basis of those absences."), <span class="Italic">modified or</span> <span class="Italic">overruled</span> by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011) (as to an excessive absence charge: "[b]ecause the efficiency of the service may suffer in the absence of an employee's services, regardless of the type of leave used, we hold that whether the leave is sick leave, annual leave, LWOP, or AWOL will not be dispositive to a charge of excessive absences"); <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 36 MSPR 561, 564 (1988) ("An agency may not discipline an employee for failure to request leave where it has granted leave covering the employee's absence."). Under <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 109 MSPR 579, 583-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2008 MSPB 197 (2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>, if an employee is entitled to sick leave sufficient to cover an absence, the employee may use the sick leave and may not be disciplined for the ensuing absence. But there remains the possibility that the employee should be removed for inability to perform the duties of the position. A caveat: if the employee's defense to an AWOL charge is that a supervisor granted him annual leave, the AWOL charge stands if the supervisor did not have the authority to grant the leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Calderon v. DOJ</span>, AT-0752-14-1000-I-1 (NP 7/13/2016) ("[R]egardless of what Lieutenant L.G. may have told the appellant, the record reflects that he lacked the authority to grant or deny the appellant annual leave." <span class="Italic">Calderon</span> added: "Although annual leave is an entitlement, it is subject to the agency's right to fix the time at which it is taken.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are exceptions, subsequently discussed, to the rule that approved absence may not support adverse action, although the exceptions are not always well defined. Action may be taken against employees who take excessive leave that is approved but beyond the employees' power to terminate. Action may also be taken against employees who violate leave-requesting procedures even if their leave is ultimately approved. Agencies may use an employee's record of approved leave in order to show that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his or her unreliable attendance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">New v. VA</span>, 82 MSPR 609, 616 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (approximately one year of absence was sufficient to sustain a charge of unreliability, undependability, and marginal value to the government because of frequent absences); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 471, 474 (1982) ("[A] prior disciplinary record based on approved leave may not be treated as a disciplinary record warranting an enhanced penalty....&#8197;Nonetheless...in an otherwise appropriate case, an agency is not precluded from showing that the employee is of marginal value...because of his unreliable attendance, albeit that leave was approved for those absences."); <span class="Italic">Watson v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 56, 58, 58 n.2 (1982) (having exercised its discretion to grant leave, the agency "is now precluded from disciplining appellant for those specific alleged infractions"; "[t]his is not to suggest that appellant's time and attendance cannot be considered in evaluating his performance or in selecting a penalty for a given actionable offense"). Under <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 109 MSPR 579, 583-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2008 MSPB 197 (2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>, if an employee is entitled to sick leave sufficient to cover an absence, the employee may use the sick leave and may not be disciplined for the ensuing absence. But there remains the possibility that the employee should be removed for inability to perform the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A "Separate Opinion" offered by Acting Chairman McPhie in <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Broadcasting Bd. of Gov.</span>, 96 MSPR 613, 620-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2004), suggested that an agency has at least two ways of dealing with an employee "using an amount of approved sick leave that the agency finds untenable." First, the agency may charge inability to perform his assigned duties; second, if the agency doubts that the employee who has been on sick leave is actually incapacitated, it can require administratively acceptable documentation of the basis for the leave if sick leave, rather than another leave status, is to be granted or denied.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects that agencies will properly police leave requests, and agencies should not penalize employees who properly obtain approval of leave requests. The employee has primary responsibility for requesting and supporting leave requests. <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 395, 399 (1987). An agency is not required to approve a leave request unless the request is based on a valid reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barner v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 357, 361 (1982) ("Notwithstanding the agency's displeasure with what it contended was the appellant's propensity to use his leave as quickly as he earned it, the fact remains that he was using earned leave. He must also have been complying with his obligations with respect to obtaining leave and have had a valid basis for each leave request; otherwise, the agency was under no obligation to approve his leave."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 620, 626 (1990) (absence cannot be considered unscheduled under Postal Service rules if the appellant called and requested leave and that leave was approved).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The general preclusion of action based on approved leave was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Webb v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 536, 542-43 (1982) (modified or overruled by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484,</a> 490 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011), as to an excessive absence charge: "[b]ecause the efficiency of the service may suffer in the absence of an employee's services, regardless of the type of leave used, we hold that whether the leave is sick leave, annual leave, LWOP, or AWOL will not be dispositive to a charge of excessive absences"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The presiding official found that the agency's grant of LWOP to appellant from March 10 through April 4, 1980, for surgery on his foot and recuperation, constituted scheduled approved leave which could not form a basis for the removal action. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that a period of approved absence may not be considered along with a period of unapproved absence as a basis for a removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bond v. Vance</span>, 327 F.2d 901 (D.C. Cir. 1964). The Board has also held, in a case arising prior to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, that a removal action for unsatisfactory attendance where all of the absences are under approved leave cannot constitute a valid cause of action. <span class="Italic">In</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">Matter of Francis A. Kibort</span>, Docket Number AR752B90418 (June 29, 1979) [not reprinted in MSPR]. The Board stated the rationale for its holding in <span class="Italic">Kibort</span> at 3-4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding the agency's assertion to the contrary, the former Civil Service Commission had a policy that, given an agency's authority to deny leave under many circumstances when it must have the services of an employee, when an agency approved an employee's request for leave, it thereby released him/her from the obligation to report for duty. Consequently, such an absence was not considered to be a breach of the employer-employee relationship, and an adverse action based on a record of approved leave normally would not be deemed to be for such cause as promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authorization of LWOP is a matter of administrative discretion and employees may not demand that they be granted LWOP as a matter of right. <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 171, 4 MSPR 84 (1980). In granting or denying LWOP, an agency should consider whether the employee's services can be spared and the legitimacy of the reasons for requesting LWOP. <span class="Italic">Kibort</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 4. Although an agency needs a dependable workforce and the very absence of an employee arguably disrupts the efficiency of the service, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Kibort</span> that where an agency grants an employee's request for LWOP it gives its official approval to the absences and it must be presumed that the approving agency officials had, in fact, made a determination that the employee's duty presence was not required. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 4. Therefore, an employee's instances of LWOP should not be considered against him or her as the basis for an adverse action as such leave constituted presumed approved leave after a determination that the employee's absence for the leave period is acceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concludes that it would be inequitable to allow an agency to take an adverse action against an employee based on his or her utilization of approved leave. Such would also be precluded by the laws (5 USC Ch. 63) and regulations (5 CFR Part 630) that entitle an employee to use annual and sick leave within prescribed circumstances and limitations. Adverse actions based on periods of approved leave would have such a negative influence on the exercise of these rights so as to deny them. Additionally, the employer-employee relationship created at the time one commences his or her employment in the federal service allows for the adverse effects of approved leave usage to the extent that it is properly exercised and is within the limits of the annual and sick leave periods specified. Therefore, an adverse action taken by an agency against an employee based on periods of approved leave is not "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 USC 7513(a). Accordingly, the Board finds that the presiding official properly determined that the <span id="Page_2429"></span>agency grant of LWOP to appellant could not be used as a specification in support of the removal action.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although periods of approved leave may not form the basis for an adverse action, an agency, in an otherwise appropriate case, may use an employee's record of approved leave in order to show that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his or her unreliable attendance. An agency may properly consider an "employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability..." as a factor in determining the appropriateness of a penalty<span class="Italic">. Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 332, 5 MSPR 280, 305 (1981). However, the underlying facts relating to such a factor must be proven by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 324, 5 MSPR at 296. The Board declines to consider the period of LWOP in this case as a factor against appellant in determining the appropriateness of the penalty. Inasmuch as the agency granted appellant LWOP with the full knowledge that the leave was necessary for his surgery and recuperation, the Board finds that it would be inappropriate to consider the leave period as a factor against him in determining the appropriateness of the penalty<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Cade v. Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPB 362, 8 MSPR 717 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may not use AWOL as a basis for an adverse action against an appellant who was in approved leave status during the period of charged absence. <span class="Italic">Cooke v. FAA</span>, 17 MSPR 376, 378 (1983) ("[A]n agency may cancel an employee's approved leave in the event of an emergency, based on evidence of legitimate underlying considerations. Nonetheless, cancellation of such previously approved leave cannot be effected without proper and timely notification to the employee."). If official time is granted to union representatives engaged in collective bargaining, they cannot be charged with either absence without leave or strike participation during the period they qualify for official time. <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 798 F.2d 461 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 254, 259 (1983) ("Thus, we find that negotiating a collective bargaining agreement encompasses the roles of appellants in this instance and that appellants were entitled to administrative leave under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(a) for the days on which they were charged. Therefore, the appellants rebutted the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> cases of strike participation and AWOL, and the agency's charges cannot be sustained").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A period of approved absence may not ordinarily be considered along with a period of unapproved absence as a basis for a removal action. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 483, 484-85 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Foster v. DHHS</span>, 18 MSPR 339, 342 (1983) ("a removal action for unsatisfactory attendance where absences are under approved leave cannot constitute a valid cause of action"); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 303, 306 (1982) (nor, in establishing the legitimacy of a penalty for a current offense, can the agency rely on past disciplinary actions based on approved leave). An agency may deny leave to an individual who has improperly requested leave and then take disciplinary action against that individual, but once leave is granted, the absence should not be used as a basis for discipline. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 24 MSPR 537, 547 (1984). At times the Board examines a record of leave usage and allegations of AWOL failures to follow leave requesting procedures and notes that the appellant "did not have enough leave to cover his absences, even if he had followed proper leave reporting procedures. <span class="Italic">Valenzuela v. Dept. of Army</span>, 107 MSPR 549, 556 &#x00B6; 18, 2007 MSPB 313 (2007).
