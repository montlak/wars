<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-10"><span class="space">a.</span> Proper Respondent in Court</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 1989 there was controversy and confusion concerning the proper respondent in Federal Circuit appeals brought to challenge certain decisions of the MSPB, e.g., disputes over counsel fee decisions and disputed decisions concerning Board jurisdiction and the timeliness of appeals. What was involved was a turf battle between the Justice Department and the Board's Office of General Counsel. The Board wanted its lawyers in court; the Justice Department felt that its expertise should be exclusive. There were other considerations. If the Board's lawyers did not handle a certain amount of appellate work, the need for their services might diminish. As to appellants, the issue was more academic than practical, but there were concerns that it was impractical to settle cases with the Board's lawyers: they represented the Board rather than the employing agency. Traced here is the evolution of the rules earlier discussed governing identification of the respondent in the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The split in representational authority between the Justice Department (on the merits) and the Board (on cases involving counsel fees, MSPB jurisdiction and timeliness of appeals) led to some odd results. MSPB would argue jurisdictional points, only to lose them and then find itself in the position of having failed to address the merits of the underlying dispute. The court did not bail the Board out. Government agencies were not to proceed piecemeal with an appeal. The court would not provide legal advice to the parties on how to proceed with their cases. <span class="Italic">Howell v. MSPB</span>, 785 F.2d 282, 285 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The court reversed a suspension on appeal after the government failed to brief the merits of the case; instead the government had unsuccessfully relied on a timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">Howell v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-2320). But the court did not always sanction the government by reversing the decision of the Board when the government failed to address the merits of the case in its brief. In <span class="Italic">Gruszka v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-525), the government filed its brief late. The court declined to consider the brief, but affirmed the Board decision nonetheless: it could properly evaluate the case on the basis of the existing record and Board decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1989 statutory amendments should lay to rest who properly defends a Board case in most litigation. The battle over who defends appeals to the Federal Circuit is traced at length in a group of decisions: <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 852 F.2d 531 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 809 F.2d 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Tiffany v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 795 F.2d 67 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Keely v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 1273 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">McCarley v. MSPB</span>, 757 F.2d 278 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 737 F.2d 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 105 S. Ct. 960 (1985); <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. MSPB</span>, 725 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Dawson v. MSPB</span>, 712 F.2d 264 (7th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Sharkey v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 84-1407); <span class="Italic">Rosano v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1315, 1316 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 695 F.2d 1389 (Fed. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1989 amendments to 5 USC 7703 were explained in <span class="Italic">Amin v. MSPB</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1249-54 (Fed. Cir. 1991), summarizing the evolution in the amendments and helped to diminish litigation over the identity of the proper respondent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners Amin and Lavender appealed their removal to the MSPB and entered into settlement agreements before the Board which resolved their appeals. Mr. Lavender subsequently alleged that the Postal Service breached the settlement by reinstating his removal and filed a petition with the Board to enforce compliance with the agreement. The administrative judge (AJ) denied his petition after determining that the petitioner did not comply with the terms of the settlement agreement. Mr. Amin petitioned the Board to set aside the settlement agreement, maintaining that his attorney lacked authority to enter into the settlement. The Board denied his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the petitions for review were filed in this Court, the Clerk named the Department of Agriculture and the United States Postal Service as the respondents. By letters to the Clerk, the MSPB requested him to recaption the cases to designate the MSPB as the respondent in each case pursuant to 5 USCA 7703(a)(2). Thereafter, the Clerk recaptioned each case by designating the Board as the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judicial review of decisions of the MSPB is provided for in 5 USCA 7703, which provides that an employee or applicant for employment may file in this court a petition for review of an adverse MSPB final decision or order. Section 7703(a)(2) governs the designation of the respondent to a petition for review. Prior to its revision in 1989, 7703(a)(2) provided that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he Board shall be the named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision issued by the Board under section 7701. In review of a final order or decision issued under section 7701, the agency responsible for taking the action appealed to the Board shall be the named respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court construed the unamended version of 7703(a)(2) on several occasions. In <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 725 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1984), petitioner appealed from a decision of the MSPB, dismissing his request for attorney fees on grounds of untimeliness. Both the MSPB and the Department of Justice raised the issue of which agency was the appropriate respondent. The court reasoned that the "agency responsible for taking the action" was the touchstone for determining who was the proper respondent in an appeal from a Board decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1372. The court determined that the action for which petitioner sought review involved MSPB procedural regulations governing the timeliness of attorney fee requests for which the employing agency had no responsibility or involvement. Therefore, the court concluded that the Board, not the employing agency, was the proper respondent in the case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Department of Treasury</span>, 852 F.2d 531 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court, sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, overruled <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>, noting that "[i]n spite of an apparent desire by the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> panel to establish a workable rule, that decision has generated some confusion and/or criticism in later cases.... " 852 F.2d at 534.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court concluded that in view of the plain meaning of the statute, which was fully supported by the legislative history, the employing agency should be designated the respondent in every petition for review of an MSPB final decision or order rendered under 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> decision, Congress amended 7703(a)(2) as part of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989). The amendment which has been codified as 5 USCA 7703(a)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board shall be named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision <span class="Italic">on the merits of the underlying personnel action</span> or on a request for attorney fees, in which case the agency responsible for taking the personnel action shall be the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history shows that <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> prompted the changes to the statutory text....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate report further explains:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 12 amends 7703(a)(2) of USC 5 to provide that the relevant agency be the named respondent in employee appeals of Board decisions where the appeal involves the underlying personnel action or a request for attorney fees. In appeals involving procedural or jurisdictional matters, the Board would be the respondent....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the 1989 Act is examined in connection with the legislative history, we think it is abundantly clear that in overruling <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span>, Congress intended that the Board shall be the respondent in all appeals involving its jurisdiction or its rulings on procedural questions, but that in appeals involving underlying personnel actions and attorney fees, the employing agencies should be the respondents. The dichotomy thus established by Congress is in accord with the traditional statutory functions of the Board and the employing agencies. In enacting the amended version of 7703(a)(2), Congress recognized that the Board has a much greater interest in questions of its jurisdiction and procedure and is better equipped than the agencies to defend its position in appeals involving these questions. Jurisdictional and procedural matters present threshold issues concerning the general adjudicatory authority of the Board. Congress believed that the Board should not depend on representation by other agencies in such areas of intrinsic interest. We think that Congressional concern over the institutional integrity of the Board also led to the provision designating the employing agencies as the respondents in cases involving personnel actions. These represent the great majority of the cases decided by the MSPB and appealed to the court. One of the fundamental purposes of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA) was to transfer the adjudicatory authority formerly exercised by the Civil Service Commission to the Merit Systems Protection Board created by the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 7 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2723, 2727-2729. If the appeals in such cases were defended by the Board, the MSPB would be placed in a position adversarial to employees whose rights it was established to adjudicate, and this would effectively undermine the purpose of the CSRA. Furthermore, the agency which took the personnel action has the primary interest in upholding its position and has available the material needed to defend its personnel actions in the appeals to this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying these conclusions to the cases before us, we must decide whether the denial of a petition for review of a settlement agreement is a decision on the merits of the underlying personnel action or a decision raising pure jurisdictional or procedural questions. We find that there are no jurisdictional issues involved in either appeal. It is undisputed that the <span id="Page_5170"></span>Board has jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement arising out of an underlying personnel action in the same case.... &#8197;For that purpose, the Board promulgated regulations governing the handling of settlement agreements by its administrative judges.... &#8197;Neither Mr. Amin nor Mr. Lavender has challenged the jurisdiction of the MSPB in these appeals. In each case, the Board assumed jurisdiction of petitioner's appeal and rendered a decision upholding or enforcing the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, there are no procedural issues in these appeals which would affect our decision. Neither Mr. Amin nor Mr. Lavender made any claim of procedural error in the proceedings before the MSPB. However, in his appeal to the court, Mr. Amin, for the first time, attempted to raise a procedural issue. His appeal is based primarily on a reiteration of his contention that his attorney had no authority to enter into the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, without deciding, that Mr. Amin has properly raised a procedural issue in his appeal, his allegations of procedural error are combined with his basic claim on the merits, namely that his appeal should be reinstated because his attorney lacked authority to enter into the settlement agreement, which had the effect of sustaining his removal from service. Our decision in <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> noted that this court has followed the practice of naming the employing agency as the respondent in cases "involving issues both on the merits of an agency's action and on the MSPB's procedures.... " 725 F.2d at 1372.... &#8197;Therefore, we hold that in cases where, as in this case, the appeal from the Board's decision presents mixed questions of procedure and the merits of an agency action, the employing agency is the proper respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether the appeals before us involve decisions on the merits of the underlying personnel action. The term "underlying personnel action" is not defined by 7703(a)(2) or its accompanying legislative history. The dictionary definition of "underlie" is "to be the basis of; form the foundation of." Webster's Third International Dictionary 2489 (17th ed. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Settlement agreements are not included within the terms of the 1989 Act, nor referred to in its legislative history. Consequently, we must look elsewhere to determine how they fit into the legislative scheme. We turn to the decisions of the court. In <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the court examined the authority of the Board to enforce its orders and stated that a compliance proceeding "is not an original personnel action." In <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the petitioner was removed from his position. He appealed to the Board where the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Later, he filed a petition with the Board for enforcement of the agreement, alleging that the agency had failed to comply with its terms. In referring to the compliance proceeding before the Board, the court declared that it was a continuation of the original personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decisions are in accord with ours on this point and recognize that the Board's jurisdiction over settlement agreements is inextricably linked to its jurisdiction of underlying personnel actions appealed to the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Amin challenges the actions of the AJ, he is seeking to overturn a decision which effectively disposed of his case on the merits. When the first settlement agreement was entered into, it was a resolution of the original personnel action. In upholding the validity of the second settlement agreement, the Board confirmed his removal from his former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The merits of Mr. Lavender's first removal, the underlying personnel action, was settled by the parties in an agreement placed in the record by the AJ. After Mr. Lavender was removed the second time, he again appealed to the Board, claiming that the Postal Service had violated the agreement and requesting reinstatement to his former position. The Board's second decision, which enforced the agreement, was clearly a decision on the merits of his removal. In his decision, which was sustained by the Board, the AJ held that the agency had not violated the terms of the settlement agreement by reinstating Mr. Lavender's removal because of his failure to comply with the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the cited decisions of this court and the Board are applied to the facts of these cases, we conclude that the holdings of the Board in the two appeals in issue are decisions on the merits of underlying personnel actions within the meaning of 5 USCA 7703(a)(2), and that the employing agencies are the proper respondents in both cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1989 amendments did not resolve all issues pertaining to the captioning of a case. Subsequent law provided further elucidation. <span class="Italic">Spruill v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 683-89 (Fed. Cir. 1992), addressed and resolved who would be the proper respondent in an appeal brought under the judicial review provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act. This decision applied the same rules to IRA cases as were applied in <span class="Italic">Amin</span> and its predecessors. Appeals involving purely jurisdictional or procedural issues are against the MSPB. Cases involving merits determinations are against the employing agency. If the case raises a mixture of issues, i.e., if the merits of the agency action are reached by the MSPB, and at the same time a matter of important MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, the employing agency is the proper respondent. If the Board applies the well-pleaded complaint rule and, assuming the facts as alleged, it determines that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the Board is the respondent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1988 the Federal Circuit, in <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Department of Treasury</span>, 852 F.2d 531 (Fed. Cir. 1988), sitting <span class="Italic">in banc</span>, overturned the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> line of cases, and ruled that only the employing agency should be the respondent on review of all decisions rendered under 7701. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 539. This was said to be dictated by the plain meaning and legislative history of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 539-40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the effect of this ruling was promptly overturned by Congress in a 1989 amendment to 7703(a)(2). Congress amended the subsection to read:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board shall be named as respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision <span class="Italic">on the merits of the underlying personnel action, or on a request for attorney fees, in which case the agency responsible for taking the personnel action shall be the respondent</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Amin v. Merit Systems Protection Bd.</span>, 951 F.2d 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court was called upon to apply the amended 7703(a)(2). Two petitioners (whose cases were consolidated) appealed their individual removals to the MSPB. When the petitions for review were filed in this court, the Clerk named the Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Postal Service, the respective employing agencies, as the respondents. By letter to the Clerk, the MSPB requested the cases be recaptioned to designate the MSPB as the respondent in each case, citing 7703(a)(2). The Clerk did so. The agencies then moved the court to reform the caption to reflect the employing agency as the respondent in each appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Judge Cowen, writing for the court, engaged in a thorough and careful analysis of 7703(a)(2) and its troubled history. The court concluded that there was no question that the 1989 amendment was in response to the <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> decision, and the court had no difficulty in understanding from the amendment and its legislative history what Congress had in mind. <span class="Italic">Amin</span>, 951 F.2d at 1251. The result, said the court, was essentially to reinstate, with a minor exception, the pre-<span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> rule of <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>. "Congress intended that the Board shall be the respondent in all appeals involving its jurisdiction or its rulings on procedural questions, but that in appeals involving underlying personnel actions and attorney fees, the employing agencies should be the respondents." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to a case in which the appeal to this court involved both the merits and the validity of MSPB procedures, the <span class="Italic">Amin</span> court, citing <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>, noted that "this court has followed the practice of naming the employing agency as the respondent in cases 'involving issues both on the merits of an agency's action and on the MSPB procedures.... '" 951 F.2d at 1252. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Howell v. Merit Systems Protection Bd.</span>, 785 F.2d 282, 285 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The <span class="Italic">Amin</span> court concluded, "[t]herefore, we hold that in cases where, as in this case, the appeal from the Board's decision presents mixed questions of procedure and the merits of an agency action, the employing agency is the proper respondent." 951 F.2d at 1252.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases controlled by 7703(a)(2), then, <span class="Italic">Amin</span> provides the necessary guidelines for determining who is the proper respondent: if only MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, it is the Board; when the underlying merits are involved, it is the employing agency; when both are involved, it is the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the beginning of this discussion we noted that there were two statutory provisions in Title 5 central to this dispute. One is 7703 and its subsections, which have just been discussed. The other is 1221(h)(1), added in 1989 as part of the IRA. It is the presence of this second provision that takes this case out of the <span class="Italic">Amin</span> context, and requires further consideration of the question of determining the proper respondent. Subsection 1221(h), paragraph (1), parrots 7703(a)(1), the general provision of the CSRA providing for judicial review of MSPB decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Board under this section may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (2) of subsection (h) states that the review "shall be filed with such court and within such time as provided for under section 7703(b)"; 7703(b) specifies, with one exception not relevant here, that review is in the Federal Circuit, and sets a 30-day filing date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DVA argument is premised basically on the proposition that this case comes to us from the MSPB under the special provisions of the IRA, and not under the general review authority of 7703(a)(1). The DVA argues that, since this case arises under 1221 with its own independent authority for review in the Federal Circuit provided by 1221(h), the provisions for designating proper respondent set out in 7703(a)(2) are not applicable; they are applicable only to cases appealed under the authority of 7703(a)<span id="Page_5171"></span>(1). Thus, says the DVA, we can decide the correct rule for determining who is the proper respondent free of the strictures of 7703(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB, on the other hand, argues 7703(a)(1) is the basis for all appeals of MSPB decisions, and that the duplicative language of 1221(h) providing for review in the Federal Circuit is mere surplusage--cautionary duplication of the preexisting review authority of 7703(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree with the DVA's view of the matter. Even if we were to consider that the appeal came to us under 1221(h) in isolation from 7703(a)(1), we have no difficulty in following the lead of the <span class="Italic">Amin</span> court in applying the principle of <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span>. Admittedly that rule was announced as an interpretation of 7703(a)(2), which subsection does address the question of who should be the respondent. The IRA in 1221 does not expressly address the question at all. However, there are good reasons for applying the <span class="Italic">Hopkins/Amin</span> rule nevertheless.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of what are the controlling criteria for determining the proper party respondent is the same question whether the appeal comes to us under the authority of 7703 or 1221. Congress, when faced with the rule of <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> as the controlling criterion for appeals under the general authority of 7703(a)(1), promptly reinstated the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> rule. The same arguments in favor of the <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> rule made here by the DVA were presented at the Congressional hearings on the issue, and were rejected by Congress. By applying the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> rule here as well, we give full credence to the expressed will of Congress and maintain a consistency of approach regardless of the underlying source of appellate jurisdiction. The language of the two acts supports this, since the grant of jurisdiction language in the one is virtually identical with the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, application of the <span class="Italic">Hopkins</span> rule to IRA appeals produces a functionally sensible process. It gives authority to shape the litigation to the agency most affected by the outcome. In most cases, that will be the employing agency. Identification of the proper respondent will be obvious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, then, it does not matter under which of these theories of appellate jurisdiction an appeal reaches this court, the result will be the same. If the issue on appeal is solely one of the procedure or jurisdiction of the MSPB, then the proper respondent is the MSPB. If the issue is solely the merits of the underlying agency action, the agency is the proper respondent. If the case raises a mixture of these issues, i.e., if the merits of the agency action are reached by the MSPB, and at the same time a matter of important MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, <span class="Italic">Amin</span> teaches that the employing agency is the proper respondent. In such a case, the MSPB need not be unrepresented since it may request intervenor status, or as was done in <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> in absence of a motion to intervene, be given status as <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before closing this part of the case, it is important to clarify what is meant by the phrase "the procedure or jurisdiction" of the MSPB as the governing criteria for designating the proper party respondent. The term "procedure" is generally well understood. It is the meaning of the term "jurisdiction" that may cause misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Jurisdiction" is a term that is one of the most slippery in the legal lexicon. It takes on different connotations depending upon the context. When we speak here of an issue involving the "jurisdiction" of the MSPB, we are referring to the power of the MSPB to hear and decide a case--subject matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Admin.</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Jurisdiction means the right or power of a tribunal to act.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sometimes the question of subject matter jurisdiction gets confused with the question of entitlement to relief, that is, whether a cause of action has been stated in the complaint, or later proved. For purposes of this discussion, precision requires that the distinction between these ideas be clearly drawn. In response to plaintiff's complaint, defendant may argue that the plaintiff's chosen forum lacks jurisdiction over the subject matter. (This may be raised, for example, by motion under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1)). A decision by the forum that the facts as alleged do not fall within its subject matter jurisdiction is properly characterized as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Defendant may also argue that the complaint's factual allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and again this may be raised by motion. Fed.R.Civ.Proc. 12(b)(6). Assuming that jurisdiction has not been challenged, or if challenged, jurisdiction has been found to exist on the basis of well-pleaded allegations in the complaint, a decision by the forum that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is a decision on the merits of the pleaded cause. By like token, if plaintiff's later proofs fail with regard to an essential factual allegation, a decision against the plaintiff is a decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent a successful claim against the government requires compliance with all statutory elements of the claim, failure of proof of an element of the cause of action means the petitioner is not entitled to the relief he seeks. To conclude in such a case that the petitioner loses because the forum is "without jurisdiction" is to obscure the nature of the defect. It would be more accurate to conclude that the petitioner has failed to prove the necessary elements of a cause for which relief could be granted. The forum had jurisdiction to hear the matter in the first instance--that is, subject-matter jurisdiction existed--as long as the petitioner asserted nonfrivolous claims....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, in suits against the Federal Government these two notions have not always been kept separate. Failure to prove a claim, it is sometimes said, means that the claimant did not come within the scope of the authorized waiver of sovereign immunity, and thus the forum must have lacked jurisdiction to hear the cause. Some of the cases coming here from the MSPB illustrate the point. These are the cases in which the facts which establish jurisdiction are intertwined with the facts which determine the merits of the cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in a case in which a petitioner before the MSPB alleges that he has been wrongly terminated from Federal employment, the Government's defense is sometimes that the petitioner voluntarily resigned, in which case there could not be wrongful removal. The MSPB, after full hearing and upon concluding from the evidence that there was a voluntary resignation, will sometimes dismiss the claim "for lack of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lamb v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 46 MSPR 470 (1990); <span class="Italic">Schumert v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 41 MSPR 350 (1989). The difficulty with this is that obviously the MSPB had jurisdiction to hear and decide the case. The failure was simply petitioner's inability to establish a key factual element of his cause of action. The MSPB correctly concluded that it could not grant relief on those facts, but it was not for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, the Board did not purport to decide the merits of the underlying factual issues, but applying the well-pleaded complaint rule and assuming the facts as alleged, it determined that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. The issue we are here to judge is whether the MSPB's jurisdictional call was correct. The MSPB is the proper party respondent.... &#8197;The motion of the DVA to recaption the case is denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spruill</span> injected the continuing, sometimes baffling, question of the distinction between a merits and jurisdictional determination in an IRA case, a topic explored in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-091.html#sec13-83">Jurisdictional Analysis Before <span class="Italic">Rusin</span></a>." In analysis relying on <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, the Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Barton v. DOJ</span>, 985 F.2d 547, 548 (Fed. Cir. 1993), that the court appeal is properly captioned against the employer-agency in an IRA case--assuming that the employee seeks relief through the Special Counsel and timely invokes the appellate jurisdiction of the Board. If the employee does not make out a case because he fails to meet the definition of a whistleblower, the case is considered to have been decided on the merits; it is not properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Armed with a decision from the Board on the merits, the appellant properly names the employer-agency as respondent in court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This matter stems from Barton's individual right of action (IRA) proceeding before the Board alleging that the Drug Enforcement Administration suspended him for three days in reprisal for whistle-blowing activities. In the Administrative Judge's (AJ) second decision, she determined that two of the documents were grievances and not within the Whistleblower Protection Act and that five other documents did not contain protected disclosures under the Whistleblower Protection Act. On this basis, the AJ dismissed Barton's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the parties rely on <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to support their positions regarding the proper respondent. The Board argues that this is a clear case of dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction, not a failure to state a claim. Justice and Barton argue that there exists a state of facts that determined not only jurisdiction, but also the merits of the case and, thus, the agency is the proper respondent under <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Justice and Barton are correct. The AJ's determination that the documents she considered did not contain protected disclosures was a determination that the appeal failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 686. Indeed, when the Board remanded the case to the AJ it stated that the AJ "may now properly assert jurisdiction over this appeal." On remand, the AJ determined that Barton failed to prove all of the statutory elements of his claim. Like the examples set forth in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, this was a determination on the merits, not a jurisdictional ruling. <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 687. With regard to the AJ's determination that five of the submitted documents did not contain protected disclosures, the AJ should have denied corrective action, rather than dismissing Barton's claim. Because this was, in part, a determination on the merits, the agency is the proper respondent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of the 2006 <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> decision that redefined how jurisdiction would be evaluated, and when it would be evaluated (at the conclusion of the presentation of argument and evidence to the Board), the opinion in a constructive adverse action case, <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB,</span> 217 Fed. Appx. 978, 978-79 <span id="Page_5172"></span>(Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), concluded the Board was the proper respondent when an involuntary resignation case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on the failure of the appellant to make out <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a)(2), the Board is designated as the respondent when the Board's decision concerns the procedure or jurisdiction of the Board. The employing agency is designated as the respondent when the Board reaches the merits of the underlying case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Williams filed an appeal at the Board alleging that her resignation from her position of administrative support assistant was involuntary. The Administrative Judge determined that she had not demonstrated that her resignation was involuntary and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Because the Board held that it did not have jurisdiction, it did not address the merits of her case. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("In a constructive action case, the jurisdictional fact at issue is almost always whether the facially voluntary action was involuntary. Involuntariness is essential for jurisdiction and it must be proven by the claimant. But while jurisdiction is established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the merits of the case are determined by the agency's compliance with &#x00A7; 7513(a)-(b). In other words, the jurisdictional determination is not identical to the merits determination.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board determined that it lacked jurisdiction, the Board is the proper respondent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An earlier decision determined that the employing agency was the proper respondent in <span class="Italic">Teale v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3072), involving an involuntary retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the appeal was docketed, the Merit Systems Protection Board intervened in the case and moved to reform the caption to designate it as the respondent. The motion was opposed by the Navy, and by order of the court, the question was referred to this panel for decision. We deny the motion to reform the caption and affirm the MSPB's decision on the merits of Mr. Teale's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The governing statute on this issue is a part of the Whistle Blower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989). It has been codified as 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(a)(2) (Supp. IV 1992), and provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board shall be named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee or applicant for employment seeks review of a final order or decision on <span class="Italic">the merits on the underlying personnel</span> action or on a request for attorney fees, in which case the agency responsible for taking the personnel action shall be the respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB and the Navy both rely on this court's recent decision in <span class="Italic">Spruill v. MSPB</span>, 978 F.2d 679 (Fed. Cir. 1992), in which Judge Plager, speaking for this court, discussed the confusion that has often arisen because of the failure to distinguish between a lack of jurisdiction and the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that <span class="Italic">Spruill</span> is the pertinent precedent and think that the following quotation from that case is dispositive of the caption issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, when determining the agency primarily affected by a decision for purposes of identifying the proper party respondent, correct legal characterization of the result is essential. For such purposes, when we refer to cases involving the "jurisdiction" of the MSPB, we do not include cases the merits of which turn on the existence of a state of facts when those facts happen also to be the factual predicate for jurisdiction. When a nonfrivolous claim for relief has been asserted before the Board, and the outcome is determined by whether the facts support that claim, a decision by the Board that they do not is a failure to prove the claim, not a lack of jurisdiction in the Board. The respondent in such a case is the employing agency, not the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">978 F.2d at 689. In support of its decision in <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, the court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bell v. Hood</span>, 327 U.S. 678 (1946), from which we quote the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Jurisdiction, therefore, is not defeated as respondents seem to contend, by the possibility that the averments might fail to state a cause of action on which petitioners could actually recover. For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">327 U.S. at 682. It is clear that the administrative judge dismissed Mr. Teale's appeal on the ground that the facts submitted by him, if accepted as true, failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Therefore, the motion to reform the caption is denied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Guidance on the captioning of an appeal from a Board decision involving a mixed question of the merits and jurisdiction in a RIF appeal was provided by <span class="Italic">Schall v. USPS</span>, 73 F.3d 341, 342-43 (Fed. Cir. 1996), maintaining the employing agency as the proper respondent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing the merits, we dispose of the board's intervention to recaption this case. The board argues that it, not the agency, is the proper respondent because <span class="Italic">Bergon</span> addressed only the board's jurisdiction. The Postal Service counters that it is properly the respondent because the board addressed an issue on the merits in reaching the determination that no jurisdiction existed over Schall's claims. We agree with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "caption issue"--whether the board or an agency is the proper respondent to a petition for judicial review of a board decision--has been the subject of considerable debate, but is now resolved. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 682-84 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Amin v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1249-51 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Ensuring that the correct party is the respondent to a petition for review is not just a procedural technicality. Having the proper respondent, and thus the proper caption, "determines which agency and whose lawyers--and therefore whose policy and practices--are represented in the appeal." <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 683. It is now beyond question that "[i]f the issue on appeal is solely one of the procedure or jurisdiction of the MSPB, then the proper respondent is the MSPB. If the issue is solely the merits of the underlying agency action, the agency is the proper respondent. If the case raises a mixture of these issues, i.e., if the merits of the agency action are reached by the MSPB, and at the same time a matter of important MSPB procedure or jurisdiction is involved, <span class="Italic">Amin</span> teaches that the employing agency is the proper respondent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 686. This statement of the law is not seriously disputed, but the parties argue over its application when an appeal involves facts common to both a jurisdictional determination and the merits. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 688.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board maintains that "[i]n <span class="Italic">Bergon</span>, the Board's jurisdictional dismissal was based solely on its finding that the appellants were affected by reduction-in-force actions but that they were not the type of employee (preference eligible) who had a right to appeal RIF actions to the Board." The board further claims to have nowhere addressed an issue that goes to the merits of a RIF action such as "whether the Postal Service properly established competitive areas or levels or correctly determined the petitioners' RIF retention rights." Therefore it says it acted merely to enforce its limited jurisdiction over only those actions which are specified by law, rule, or regulation, and is the proper respondent to Schall's petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board's argument overlooks that it addressed the most fundamental merits issue: Whether the agency actions against the individual appellants were taken pursuant to a RIF. Although prior to <span class="Italic">Bergon</span>, the board for all intents and purposes had determined that the agency had conducted a RIF in 1992 and 1993... it had not addressed whether the specific actions against Schall and the others were taken pursuant to that RIF. That is important because if the agency actions were actually adverse actions directed at the individual appellants, rather than RIF actions, then some of them may have been able to appeal even though they were not preference eligible postal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a). If the board correctly determined that the <span class="Italic">Bergon</span> appellants were affected by agency RIF actions and that none of them were preference eligible postal employees, it follows that it did not have jurisdiction to hear their appeals. When, as here, the board makes a finding on a merits issue en route to an ultimate determination that it is without jurisdiction to hear an appeal, it is the agency whose conduct is at issue and the agency <span class="Italic">always</span> must be allowed to defend its actions as the respondent to a petition for review in this court. In <span class="Italic">Bergon</span>, the board addressed a merits issue when it determined that the appellants were affected by a RIF action. Therefore we proceed with the Postal Service as respondent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For further discussion of the distinction between an absence of Board jurisdiction and the failure to state a claim within the Board's jurisdiction, refer to Judge Plager's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Link v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("An employee who attempts to appeal to the Board in the face of a valid and enforceable last chance agreement fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, because the employee has waived his right to that relief. This has nothing to do with the subject-matter jurisdiction of the MSPB or this court."). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walley v. VA</span>, 279 F.3d 1010 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (comparing subject matter jurisdiction and burden of proof issues).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to retirement cases, <span class="Italic">Mindana v. OPM</span>, 985 F.2d 1070, 1072 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason why the same analysis should not apply to OPM benefits cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the issue on appeal is solely one of the procedure or jurisdiction of the MSPB then the proper respondent is the MSPB. If the issue is solely the merits of the underlying agency action, the agency is the proper respondent. If the case raises a mixture of these issues... <span class="Italic">Amin</span> teaches that the employing agency is the proper respondent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 686. In this case, Mindana presented both a merits issue (his entitlement to credit for his military service, decided against him because of issue preclusion) and a jurisdictional issue. Under <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, OPM is the proper party respondent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5173"></span>Although there have been plenty of decisions from the Federal Circuit addressing the question of whether the MSPB or the agency is named as the respondent, with the related issue of whether Board or Justice Department lawyers will provide representation, there are agencies with their own litigating authority, and their lawyers may be able to appear in the Federal Circuit as counsel to their agencies without Justice Department involvement. Refer to <span class="Italic">Cooper v. TVA</span>, 723 F.2d 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for review of the statutory underpinnings of DOJ representational authority in court and, in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, the statutory underpinnings of the authority of TVA lawyers to appear in court on behalf of their agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of who is going to represent a respondent before the Federal Circuit is not of great importance to the appellant. The Justice Department and the Board's General Counsel will sort the matter out with a little help from the Federal Circuit Clerk. The dispute will add a dimension to the litigation, but it should not materially affect the outcome of the case.</p>
