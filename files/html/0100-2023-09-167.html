<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-165"><span class="space">g.</span> Agreement to Accept Demotion, Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The LCA may reduce a penalty from one level to another (suspension to reprimand) or change the nature of the action (demotion rather than removal; suspension rather than removal or demotion). <span class="Italic">Koczan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 160, 164-65 (1989), involved an employee who received a removal decision based on unsatisfactory performance. The agency then offered and she purportedly accepted a demotion under an agreement that if her performance was less than fully successful in the new position during the first year, her removal action would be reinstated and she would waive her right to appeal either the then-suspended removal or any performance-based action during that first year in her new position. The agreement was sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although similar, the October 11 Agreement is distinguishable in two respects from the agreements approved in <span class="Italic">McCall</span> and <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>. First, unlike those employees, the appellant had not yet been removed or demoted from her GS-5 position when the Agreement was executed. In <span class="Italic">Ferby</span>, the Board specifically reserved the question of whether a last-chance agreement would violate public policy if it was predicated on something less than a fully effected removal....&#8197;We have subsequently upheld a waiver of appeal rights in a last-chance agreement executed after an agency's decision to remove, but before the removal became effective. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 162, 165 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 39 MSPR 645 (1989) [both cases discussed earlier] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the October 11 Agreement is distinguishable from the <span class="Italic">McCall</span> and <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> agreements in that the appellant agreed to take a different, lower-graded position rather than retention in her former position. She argues that it is inherently unfair to waive the opportunity to improve and the right to appeal a performance-based removal from a job that one has never before performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that a last-chance settlement agreement involving a demotion is not unconscionable <span class="Italic">per se.</span> The essence of the appellant's bargain was the same as that of an employee who retains his former position. She retained her employment and was given an opportunity to demonstrate satisfactory performance. In return, she gave up the right to appeal her original removal, a course in which she had a substantial risk of forfeiting any right to employment. <span class="Italic">See McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667. Even if a demotion might be viewed as harsh, or even unreasonable, that is not sufficient to invalidate the agreement as unconscionable. <span class="Italic">See Gonzales</span>, 38 MSPR at 167, <span class="Italic">citing Tootsie Roll Indus. v. Local Union No. 1,</span> <span class="Italic">Bakery, Confectionery &#x0026; Tobacco Workers' Intl Union</span>, 832 F.2d 81, 83 (7th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence that the downgrade accepted by the appellant in the October 11 Agreement is inherently unfair. The agency was removing the appellant from her GS-5 position because, in its view, she was not satisfactorily performing her duties, even after an opportunity to improve, and would have as good or even a better chance of performing satisfactorily in the GS-4 position. There is no evidence that the agency offered the new position in the bad faith knowledge or belief that the appellant was unqualified for or would be unable to perform the duties of that position. Moreover, if the agency were to remove the appellant from her new position under the terms of the Agreement, the appellant may appeal the action for the Board's preliminary jurisdictional determination of whether the agency invoked the Agreement in good faith. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCall,</span> 839 F.2d at 667.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pawlowski v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 353, 357-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-18 (2004), analyzes a preaction LCA involving a demotion and the necessity for an appealable action that is otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that where, as here, an LCA was not reached during the course of a Board appeal, its validity may nonetheless be challenged when the LCA is brought before the Board to give legal effect to its terms in connection with a later-filed Board appeal<span class="Italic">.

Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 84-85 (1998) (the Board has the authority to consider the validity of a pre-appeal settlement agreement in which the appellant agreed to resign to determine its effect upon a personnel action before the Board). A party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating it. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 671 &#x00B6; 7 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee-initiated actions are presumed to be voluntary, and the Board does not have jurisdiction over voluntary actions<span class="Italic">. Soler-Minardo v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100 &#x00B6; 5 (2002), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 545 (Fed. Cir. 2002). "Employee-initiated" does not mean that the change must be first suggested by the employee, but instead indicates that the employee voluntarily accepted an agency's proposal<span class="Italic">. Gaudette v. Department of Transportation</span>, 832 F.2d 1256, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Further, an employee's decision is not rendered involuntary because he must choose between unpleasant alternatives<span class="Italic">. Soler-Minardo</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100 &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, "[a]n employee-initiated action is considered involuntary if it resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements, or from the agency's failure to provide the employee with adequate information on which to make an informed choice." <span class="Italic">Smitka v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 680, 689 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 605 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 512 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (a settlement agreement may be set aside on certain limited grounds such as fraud, misrepresentation, or mutual mistake); <span class="Italic">Vasquez</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 131 (an appellant may show that an LCA is invalid, and thus that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal, by proving that the agreement was unlawful, involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake). To establish misrepresentation, the appellant must show that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements<span class="Italic">. Thomas</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 512 &#x00B6; 10 n.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties in this case entered into a settlement agreement, the LCA, after the agency proposed the appellant's removal. In the LCA, the parties agreed that the appellant would be placed in a WG-2 Laundry Worker position. This would normally be considered a voluntary action over which the Board lacks jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Soler-Minardo</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100 &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Newman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 64, 68-69 (1998) (to establish that the acceptance of a demotion resulting from a settlement agreement was involuntary, an appellant must show that the agency failed to meet its obligations to inform him of the consequences of the acceptance of the demotion and that he would not have consented to the settlement agreement and the new position if he had been informed of those consequences).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant is challenging the validity of the LCA and the provision therein that caused his demotion. The appellant argues that he was constructively demoted because he was not returned to his Police Officer position after his successful completion of the 12-month LCA period. Specifically, he alleges that the agency misrepresented that (1) the terms of the agreement would only last 12 months from the date of execution, (2) all charges in support of the appellant's removal from his Police Officer position would be dismissed and rescinded upon his successful completion of the agreement, and (3) the appellant would only be precluded from holding a Police Officer position during the 12-month LCA period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's first two allegations of misrepresentation restate express provisions of the LCA in which the agency agreed to "[r]escind the removal after twelve (12) months of satisfactory compliance with this agreement" and agreed that "[t]he terms of this agreement are valid for a period of one (1) year from the date of execution below. Upon successful completion of this 1-year agreement, any and all charges now pending against RAYMOND PAWLOWSKI will be dismissed." It is unclear how express provisions of the agreement could be construed as agency misrepresentations. It seems that the appellant is making a thinly veiled claim that the agency breached these provisions. However, as the appellant conceded below, the Board lacks jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement not entered into the record for enforcement purposes in a Board appeal<span class="Italic">. Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 583 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to his third claim of agency misrepresentation, the LCA is silent with regard to what the appellant's position was supposed to be after the 1-year LCA period ended. The appellant contends that the agency never advised him that his assignment to a Laundry Worker <span id="Page_1138"></span>position was considered a permanent demotion or reduction in pay or grade. He does not allege, however, that the agency told him that he would regain his Police Officer position at the end of the LCA period or that he would only occupy the Laundry Worker position during the 1-year LCA period. Therefore, the appellant has not articulated any nonfrivolous allegations that the agency made misrepresentations to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not alleged any other basis for invalidating the settlement agreement. Even if he had argued that the parties were mistaken concerning his position following the 1-year LCA period, it appears that any mistake was unilateral on the part of the appellant, and unilateral mistakes are not a basis for finding a settlement agreement invalid<span class="Italic">. See McDavid v. Department of the Army</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 601, 605 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board cannot consider parol evidence, such as the appellant's affidavit regarding his understanding of the agreement, because the LCA is not ambiguous. It is well settled that, in construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time of contracting<span class="Italic">. McDavid</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 601, 604 (1991). The Board will only consider extrinsic evidence or argument if the agreement is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the LCA contains no provision addressing what position the appellant was to hold after the 1-year LCA period ended. The LCA's silence on this issue does not mean the LCA is ambiguous<span class="Italic">. See Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 594, 599 (1998) (an LCA's silence regarding the appellant's future appeal rights did not make the agreement ambiguous); <span class="Italic">De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 526, 530 (1993) (a written settlement agreement was not ambiguous where it was silent regarding the appellant's 30-year retirement, which he claimed the agency had promised him). When an agreement is silent as to a term, that term is removed from the Board's jurisdiction, and the Board lacks the authority to unilaterally modify the agreement's material terms<span class="Italic">. De Luna</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 530. It appears that the parties, both of whom were represented by counsel, simply failed to include a provision in the LCA addressing the issue of the appellant's position after the LCA period ended. While that may have been unwise, its omission did not render the LCA ambiguous or invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it was not improper for the administrative judge to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing. In order to receive a jurisdictional hearing, the appellant must set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">Briscoe</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 140. As stated previously, the appellant did not set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. Therefore, the administrative judge properly decided the matter without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency and an appellant may negotiate an LCA that imposes a suspension in lieu of removal and reimposes the removal, with waiver of an appeal, if the appellant repeats <span id="Page_1139"></span>conditions underlying the original adverse action. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. VA</span>, 117 MSPR 611, 612-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9, 2012 MSPB 23 (2012), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Cooper v. VA</span>, 515 Fed. Appx. 897 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP).</p>
