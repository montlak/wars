<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 and 1995, the Board attempted to synthesize the decisional morass and provide better and broader guidance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a challenge to the Postal Service's program to encourage early retirements or voluntary downgradings in return for job security, the timeliness determinants were: whether the agency was notified of the employee's concerns about the involuntariness of the action and whether the employer then gave the employee notice of appeal rights; and, in the absence of notice to and from the agency, whether the employee reasonably sought and acted upon information from other sources concerning appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 309-14 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A resignation or retirement is generally a voluntary action and is presumed to be such. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 715.201-715.202. Although an employee is entitled to notice of his right to appeal to the Board from actions that are appealable to it, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21, he is not entitled to notice of appeal rights from a voluntarily-initiated action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gaynor v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 481, 484 (1990). Usually, to invoke a right to such notice, he must have placed the agency on notice that, contrary to the presumption, he considers his action to have been involuntary, or the circumstances must show that the agency was, or reasonably should have been, aware of facts indicating that the retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 378 (Ct. Cl. 1974); <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 594, 596 (1989). Here, it is undisputed that the appellant did not tell the agency at any time prior to his appeal that he considered his retirement to be involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim that his retirement was involuntary is apparently based on the Board having found that the agency's restructuring constituted a reorganization and that employees who were demoted by the agency due to it were subjected to RIFs<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Robinson v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 307 (1994); <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345 (1993). In <span class="Italic">Shubinsky v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1003, 203 Ct. Cl. 202 (Ct. Cl. 1973), the court found that where the agency withholds information concerning an employee's right to appeal what was ultimately determined to be a RIF, or affirmatively misrepresents his procedural right, it is incumbent on the agency to rectify its misrepresentation, and if it does not, the appellant is justified in relying on the agency's erroneous information and not filing a timely appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 488 F.2d 1003, 203 Ct. Cl. at 203-204. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 385-386 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the court found that the agency's repeatedly misinforming the appellant that his position had been reclassified, so that any appeal right lay with the Office of Personnel Management rather than the Board, constituted good cause for his delay in filing an appeal because a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency's statements.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Under facts similar to those in <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, the court found in <span class="Italic">Gordy v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984), that although the agency misinformed him, the appellant was aware long before he filed his appeal that he had the right to do so. In the instant case, there is no record evidence of such an awareness on this appellant's part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In both <span class="Italic">Shubinsky</span> and <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, the agencies had informed the appellants that they would have no Board appeal right from the actions taken against them. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, the court noted that the appellant is not required to assume that the agency gave him critical misinformation, and that the appellant had independently pursued his rights by filing a grievance with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Yuni</span>, 784 F.2d at 387. Under the circumstances, it found that the "balance of fairness" did not lie with the agency<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 944 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (where the agency's RIF notice was "both inadequate and erroneous," the appellant's right of appeal should not be prejudiced). Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court found that where an agency takes an action that is appealable to the Board, it must, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21, inform the employee of his right to file an appeal, the time limit for doing so, and other relevant information to allow him to effectuate his right. Finally in this regard, we note that pursuant to <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the misinformation given by the agency may have been innocently given, but if the employee relies on it to his detriment, it suffices to invoke the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Clearly, similarities exist between these cases and the situation at issue here. Nonetheless, although no RIF action was there involved, we find the dispositive circumstances of this case more like those found in <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164 (Fed. Cir. 1993). There, the agency had demoted the appellant for breach of a last chance settlement agreement. Because it found that he had waived his right of appeal when he signed that agreement, the agency did not notify him of a right to appeal his demotion to the Board. Only after the demotion was effected did the court decide, in an unrelated appeal, that an appellant has a limited right to appeal an action taken pursuant to a last chance agreement when he makes a nonfrivolous allegation that he did not breach it. The court found this situation distinguishable from that in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, 839 F.2d 669, for several reasons: Because the agency's obligation to give notice in <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> was not contingent upon any action by the employee, so that he was not responsible in any way for the agency's failure to give the required notice; because it was not clear at the time of appellant Clark's demotion that he had even a limited right to appeal to the Board; because neither 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21 nor any other regulation expressly requires a notice of appeal rights when effecting an action pursuant to the parties' agreement; and because the agency's obligation to inform the appellant of a right to appeal is contingent on his having provided it with a nonfrivolous <span id="Page_984"></span>allegation concerning compliance with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 989 F.2d at 1169-70. In so holding, the court found the situation comparable to that where the appellant voluntarily retires or resigns. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1169. It concluded that the agency was not obligated to provide a notice of appeal rights and that the appellant's delay should be factored into the discretionary decision to waive the time limits; the more he delays, the less likely the equities will weigh in his favor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1170.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the situation in which the instant case arose, the Board has held, as noted above, that a demotion effected by the agency because of its restructuring is an appealable RIF as to preference eligible employees. Nonetheless, there is no evidence in this or other appeals that have come before the Board that the agency was aware that its action could only have been a RIF, so that its preliminary information to the appellant before his retirement, that did not include notification of any RIF appeal rights, has not been shown to have been in bad faith, contrary to the clear facts, or aimed at misleading him.[6] This is of particular importance because the agency did not effect, or apparently even propose, the appellant's demotion; rather, he retired before the agency took any action against him, so that the issue before the Board in this appeal is not whether he was subject to a RIF, but whether he retired involuntarily. Therefore, as in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, any right to notice of appeal rights the agency may have been obligated to provide for its already-taken action could only arise from the occurrence of an external event (in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the issuance of a court decision granting a limited right of appeal in the case of actions based on the breach of a last chance settlement agreement, and here the issuance of Board decisions finding the agency's restructuring to be a reorganization that might lead to RIF actions against affected employees). In both cases, however, the agency's obligation to provide such notice is contingent on the appellant notifying it that he believes that the action <span class="Italic">at issue</span> was involuntary (through a nonfrivolous allegation that one in appellant Clark's position had, in fact, complied with the last chance settlement, or for one in the instant appellant's place, a nonfrivolous challenge to the voluntariness of his retirement).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As noted above, for purposes of the Board's jurisdiction, the fact that the agency's misrepresentation may have been innocently made is of no consequence. That the agency did not reasonably know that it was required to inform the appellant of appeal rights, however, was significant to the timeliness determination in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 989 F.2d at 1169-70. <span class="Italic">Cf. Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584 (Ct. Cl. 1975) (the choice between unpleasant alternatives does not render the selection involuntary unless the agency coerced the appellant by bringing an action that it knew could not be sustained; only under the latter circumstance would a right to appeal exist and would the appellant, therefore, be entitled to notice of it).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Smith v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 135, 137 (1994) (the appellant did not show good cause for his late filed petition for review of a settlement agreement in which he was not awarded back pay where the law establishing an entitlement to back pay if he had prevailed on his appeal had not, at the time of the settlement, been made). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Romine v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 68 (1994) (the Board declined to extend <span class="Italic">Clark</span> to the agency's failure to notify the appellant of a right to appeal his placement on enforced leave because at the time he was placed in that status it was well established that this action constituted a constructive suspension and therefore was appealable).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant case differs from <span class="Italic">Yuni</span> and <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, we find, because there the agencies affirmatively misinformed the appellants that the actions they effected were not appealable RIFs. Here, the only action the agency effected was the appellant's presumably voluntary retirement, and the record evidence shows that although it put out news bulletins prior to the retirement indicating that use of RIF was one of the options it was considering, and that there would be no layoffs and certain other benefits extended to any employee assigned to a lower graded position...there is no evidence that indicates that the agency specifically informed employees prior to the appellant's retirement that actions effected during the restructuring would not be RIFs. Further, in light of the generous financial incentive offered to employees to retire early, even the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span> would not either necessarily or directly have led to a conclusion that each of the 47,000 former employees who accepted it immediately believed that his or her retirement had become an involuntary adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the appellant was not entitled to be given notice of a right to appeal to the Board at the time of his retirement and that he has not shown that he became entitled to such notice at any later date because he did not give the agency any indication, and certainly not the required nonfrivolous allegation, that he considered his retirement involuntary....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decision was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Krizman v. MSPB</span>, 77 F.3d 434, 439-40 (Fed. Cir. 1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not required to find good cause for an untimely appeal whenever an employee claims that the agency failed to provide him with all the information he regards as pertinent to his decision whether to challenge the agency action. In <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 989 F.2d 1164 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court addressed the question whether an agency's failure to advise an employee of his right to appeal to the Board on the issue of compliance with a "last chance" settlement agreement constituted "good cause" for the employee's untimely appeal. The court noted that the agency was not aware at the time that the employee enjoyed a limited right of appeal to the Board. Although a later decision of this court established that the employee could take such an appeal, the court in <span class="Italic">Clark</span> declined to hold that the agency should have foreseen that later decision; the court therefore held that the agency's failure to apprise the employee of his appeal rights did not constitute good cause for the employee's untimely appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 989 F.2d at 1167-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the analysis employed in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Board held that good cause for Krizman's untimely appeal was not established simply because the Postal Service failed to advise him that reassignments to lower-graded positions would be deemed RIF actions even for employees who were guaranteed retained pay and grade. The Board observed that, as in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the agency had not acted in a manner contrary to the clear facts, in bad faith, or for the purpose of misleading Krizman. It therefore concluded that, under those circumstances and in light of Krizman's failure to exercise diligence to discover and protect his right of appeal, Krizman failed to show good cause for filing an appeal that was nine months out of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to note that in addressing the question of what constitutes good cause for an untimely appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.23(c), we are not applying a statute or court rule. Rather, we are reviewing the Board's interpretation of one of its own regulations, promulgated pursuant to statutes that give the Board "broad discretion in handling appeals and controlling its own docket by requiring that appeals be processed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board." <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, 695 F.2d at 1390-91 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a)). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(h). As the Supreme Court has frequently observed, an administrative agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to great deference. In that setting, "the ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation." <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 65 S. Ct. 1215, 89 L. Ed. 1700 (1945). <span class="Italic">See also, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Martin v. Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Review Comm'n</span>, 499 U.S. 144, 150-51, 111 S. Ct. 1171, 1175-76, 113 L. Ed.2d 117 (1991)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same principle applies here. In <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306 (1994), and in subsequent cases, including this one, the Board has consistently interpreted its "good cause" regulation not to excuse an untimely appeal by a retiree in Krizman's position simply because the agency failed to advise him of all the possible consequences of not retiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the standard governing review of an agency's interpretation of its own regulations, the Board's interpretation of its "good cause" regulation must be sustained. Because the Board's interpretation of its "good cause" regulation is "a reasonable, consistently applied administrative interpretation of the regulation by the agency that promulgated it," <span class="Italic">Ehlert v. United States</span>, 402 U.S. 99, 105, 91 S. Ct. 1319, 1323, 28 L. Ed.2d 625 (1971), we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion in the manner in which it interpreted and applied that regulation in this case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tedesco v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 90 MSPR 367, 370-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001) (enforced leave: when an agency has not provided an appellant with notice of appeal rights, the appellant must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuing appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Higgins v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Krizman</span> was followed and explained in <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583, 586-89 (1995), an opinion demonstrating the need for simplification of the rules for appealing constructively adverse actionsin the appeal of Mr. Gingrich, a constructively adverse retirement. The best rule would time the appeal from the point when the appellant should reasonably have been on notice--from any source--of an appeal right. However, until the Board simplifies its approach, <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span> lays down the guidance that will be lost on <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants but perhaps be understood by representatives--if the agency should have issued a notice of appeal rights, the appellant need not seek them out but must promptly appeal once he learns of them:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed his appeal 19 months late. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). In an appropriate case, an administrative judge may assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that an appellant was subjected to an appealable action and has standing to appeal, and go on to dismiss an appeal as untimely filed, if the record on timeliness is sufficiently developed<span class="Italic">. See Popham v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 193 (1991). Such an approach is not appropriate, though, if the jurisdictional and timeliness issues are "inextricably intertwined." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 198 n.5; <span class="Italic">accord Romine v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 68, 72 (1994). Thus, it was not appropriate to assume <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that an appellant was constructively suspended and to dismiss his appeal as untimely filed, where the agency knew that the appellant considered his absence from duty to be involuntary, it did not advise him of his appeal rights, and it was well-established at the relevant time that an involuntary absence (i.e., agency-initiated) is considered to be an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See Romine</span>, 64 MSPR at 71-73.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant's only allegation in support of his argument that the agency should have advised him of his right to appeal his retirement was that the agency did not tell him how he would be affected by the restructuring if he did not retire, then the administrative judge would have been correct to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed with no showing of good cause. That allegation, standing alone, and taken as true, would not establish that the agency should have informed him that he could appeal his retirement; if he had not been entitled to such notice, then he would have had to exercise due diligence in discovering his rights, if any, and as the administrative judge found, he did not show that he exercised such diligence. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 309-13 (1994) (where the agency had no reason to know that an employee who retired during the 1992 restructuring considered his retirement to have been involuntary, and where neither the agency nor the employee knew how he would have been affected by the restructuring if he had not retired, it was not required to inform him that he could appeal his retirement; absent an obligation on the agency's part to provide appeal rights, such an employee must establish that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover whatever appeal rights he might have, if his Board appeal claiming involuntary retirement is late).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the administrative judge, the appellant herein alleged more than that the agency did not tell him how he would be affected by the restructuring if he did not retire, however. He alleged that he asked that the following remarks be inserted on the PS-50 memorializing his separation: "Retirement caused by breach of salary and benefits contract and duress due to lack of information from the restructuring to protect my rights." This allegation is supported by the PS-50 itself. The appellant argued that, based on this statement, the agency should have known that he considered his retirement involuntary. As to the belated filing <span id="Page_986"></span>of the appeal, the appellant alleged, without rebuttal, that he had never been advised by the agency that he could appeal his retirement, and that he did not learn he might be able to challenge the retirement until shortly after June 24, 1994, when an acquaintance told him that an article in the <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span> suggested that "retirees may have appeal rights." The appellant further alleged that he then contacted Board headquarters and requested an appeal form, which he filed on July 22, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these allegations, it was error for the administrative judge to have dismissed the appeal as untimely filed without resolving the jurisdictional issue. An agency is obligated to notify an employee of his or her Board appeal rights when it takes an appealable action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.21. Further, where, as here, an employee puts an agency on notice that he considers an action to be involuntary, "it triggers a duty on the part of the agency to provide the employee with appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 557, 560 (1992) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">accord Krizman v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 233, 236 (1995). As a general matter, an agency's failure to notify an employee of his or her Board appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will justify a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 673 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (the "critical and controlling fact" in the court's determination to excuse an untimely filing by an appellant who should have received notice of his appeal rights from the agency, but did not, was "not the alleged lack of diligence on [the appellant's] part..., but the...violation [by the agency] of regulations" requiring that notice of appeal rights be given); <span class="Italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 386 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("the Government cannot," after receiving specific notice from an employee making "abundantly clear" he believes he is being subjected to an action that the agency knows or should know is appealable, "do nothing to inform the [employee] of the proper appeal procedures and then defend on the grounds of [the employees]'s failure to make a timely appeal") (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">McCormack v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 371, 1974 WL 21684 (1974)); <span class="Italic">Gordy v. MSPB</span>, 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (the "critical element" in determining whether to excuse an untimely filing by an employee who should have received notice of appeal rights from an agency, but did not, is whether the employee promptly filed an appeal upon learning of his or her right to do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the agency should have advised the appellant of his appeal rights at the time of his retirement, because it knew that he considered his retirement to be involuntary. Given this finding, she should not have gone on to discuss whether the appellant exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights following his retirement. Under <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> and <span class="Italic">Gordy</span>, and in contrast to <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, an appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights. Rather, the question is whether the appellant was diligent in filing an appeal alleging involuntary retirement after he learned he could do so. Under the undisputed facts recounted above, the appellant did exercise such diligence, filing his appeal less than one month after he found out that individuals who retired during the agency's nationwide restructuring may be able to contest their retirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing whether the appellant was diligent in attempting to discover his appeal rights, the administrative judge impliedly found that the appellant knew or should have known, long before late June of 1994, that he could appeal his separation by retirement to the Board. Specifically, she suggested that a widely-publicized Board decision issued on July 21, 1993, <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345 (1993), put the appellant on notice that he could appeal his retirement. "Notice from a source other than the agency of a general appeal right to the Board does not excuse the agency's failure to inform an employee of his appeal rights, where the notice does not inform the employee of the time limit for filing an appeal to the Board and lacks other information on where and how to file such an appeal." <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span>, 55 MSPR at 560 (citation omitted). We do not find that our <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision, in which we held that some reassignments during the agency's restructuring were actually demotions that should have been accomplished by formal RIF procedures, put the appellant on notice that he may have been able to appeal his retirement as involuntary. As stated by the appellant, the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision did not relate to his "situation as a retiree." Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decision did not describe where, when, and how to file a Board appeal, so it did not meet the <span class="Italic">Nicoletti</span> test for constructive notice of a retiree's right to file a Board appeal, at least not in the case of a retiree who should have been advised of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Cf. Yuni</span>, 784 F.2d at 386-87 (in the absence of evidence that an appellant who received an inaccurate notice of his appeal rights knew or should have known the correct appeal procedures, the fact that other employees who were affected by the same action and who received similar notices promptly filed appeals in the correct forum did not support a finding that there was no good cause for the appellant's untimely filing). We also note that, although the appellant apparently knew of the Board's existence due to his position as a Manager, there is no evidence that he possessed specialized knowledge such that he could reasonably have been expected to know that a separation by early-out retirement may be appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, the administrative judge should have recognized that the appeal could not be resolved by assuming that jurisdiction exists and dismissing it as untimely. <span class="Italic">See Romine</span>, 64 MSPR at 71-73. We find that the appellant has established good cause for the untimely filing of his Board appeal. The agency has not shown, or even claimed, that it was prejudiced by the late filing. Accordingly, the deadline shall be waived. <span class="Italic">See Dow v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 21, 24-25 (1994) (if an appellant establishes good cause for an untimely filing, the Board will waive the filing deadline, in the absence of prejudice to the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hendricks v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 163, 168 (1995), interpreted <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span> and <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> to mean that the agency's failure to provide notice of appeal rights after an employee notifies the agency that she considers an action to be involuntary will ordinarily excuse a belated filing; the employee who should receive notice "is not required to show that she exercised due diligence in attempting to discover her appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Hendricks</span> further determined that a prior notice of appeal rights attendant to an adverse action that was not implemented does not provide notice of appeal rights from a subsequent alleged involuntary reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamiel v. USPS,</span> 104 MSPR 497, 502 &#x00B6; 8, 2007 MSPB 17 (2007) (applying <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>: "However, an appellant who was not provided with the required notice of appeal rights need not show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so."); <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM,</span> 90 MSPR 124, 130 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (citing and following <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>); <span class="Italic">Lohf v. USPS,</span> 71 MSPR 81, 86-87 (1996) (appellant's receipt of a notice of proposed removal was not sufficient to charge him with knowledge of the time limit for appealing a period of enforced leave).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Murray v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 177, 182-83 (1995), summarized the interplay of <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> and <span class="Italic">Gingrich</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated in <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988), an agency's failure to notify an employee of his appeal rights under circumstances requiring it to do so will generally justify a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 670-74. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span>, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, an appellant who should have been advised of his appeal rights, but was not, is not required to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 583, 588 (May 23, 1995). Thus, without a hearing to determine whether the agency should have given the appellant appeal rights, the administrative judge could not have properly determined whether <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> or <span class="Italic">Jones</span> applies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming that <span class="Italic">Shiflett</span> applies, the appellant must show that he was diligent in filing an appeal alleging involuntary retirement after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 588. As to the belated filing of his appeal, the appellant alleges that "about October 1994" he "heard" that his position had not been abolished in the restructuring, and that the agency did not inform him of any appeal rights until he received a notice from the agency on November 7, 1994, stating that he might have such rights. On remand, the parties shall be given an opportunity to present argument and evidence on the issue of when the appellant learned of his appeal right, and whether, under the circumstances, he was diligent in filing his appeal on November 26, 1994. <span class="Italic">See Gingrich</span>, 67 MSPR at 588 (appellant exercised diligence in filing his appeal less than one month after he found out that individuals who retired during the agency's nationwide restructuring may be able to contest their retirements).</p>

However, if the appellant failed to put the agency on notice that he considered his resignation or retirement involuntary, he was not entitled to notice of Board appeal rights and therefore must establish that he exercised due diligence in discovering and pursuit those rights.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Blaske v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 164 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Blaske v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3014), reiterated the underlying requirement of the appellant's due <span id="Page_987"></span>diligence if the agency has no reason to provide notice of appeal rights to the appellant, 76 MSPR at 167-69:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An involuntary resignation appeal can be disposed of on timeliness grounds, without deciding whether the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, if the employee resigned under circumstances that did not give rise to an agency obligation to provide a notice of appeal rights, and the appellant's delay in bringing the appeal was not excusable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an individual files a late appeal claiming that she resigned involuntarily, and if the agency had no obligation to advise her of any potential right of appeal, then the individual must show that she was diligent in attempting to discover her rights and that she filed her appeal promptly upon learning them....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holloway v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 82 MSPR 435, 443 &#x00B6; 21 (1999), dismissed the appeal when the agency was not required to provide notice of appeal rights and the appellant failed to exercise due diligence in discovering his right to appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant chose to resign after the agency correctly informed him that retaining his federal employment while running for partisan political office would subject him to prosecution and possible removal for violation of the Hatch Act....&#8197;A resignation is not involuntary merely because it is tendered to avoid a threatened removal. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v. U.S. Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1136-37 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Blaske,</span> 76 MSPR at 168. Although the appellant's resignation letter states that it was not a "voluntary resignation," it further states that he correctly understood it to be "a mandatory resignation due to political activity and federal guidelines." Thus, the record shows that the appellant made an informed choice to resign, and he has not alleged or shown any basis for finding that the agency had reason to know that his resignation might be involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Blaske,</span> 76 MSPR at 169; <span class="Italic">cf. Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 583, 586-87 (1995) (the agency was obligated to provide notice of appeal rights where the appellant asked that his retirement documents reflect that it was "caused by breach of salary and benefits contract and duress due to lack of information from the restructuring to protect my rights"). We therefore find that the agency was not obligated to provide him with a notice of appeal rights with respect to his resignation. <span class="Italic">See Blaske,</span> 76 MSPR at 169. Nor has the appellant alleged or shown that he was diligent in attempting to discover his appeal rights or that there was otherwise good cause for his filing delay of more than a year. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 169-70. Accordingly, we dismiss the matter as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 171. Because there are no disputed facts regarding the timeliness issues, the appellant is not entitled to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Persons v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 428, 433 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The constructive notice theory may hold little weight if the agency misleads or incorrectly advises the employee as to his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yuni</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. A defective notice of appeal rights may not serve to start the appeal period running, irrespective of who receives the defective notice or, apparently, when the deficient notice is received. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 669 (Fed. Cir. 1988). But even if an agency notification of an action contains a deficient notice concerning appeal rights, once the employee has learned of those rights, he must then act to perfect the appeal and cannot continue to discuss the case with agency officials for several months. <span class="Italic">Gribble v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 5 MSPR 481, 483, 5 MSPB 480 (1981). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
