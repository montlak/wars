<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-284"><span class="space">2.</span> Negotiable Proposals</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was that the employer attempt to continue the employment of employees who voluntarily admitted drug abuse and demonstrated successful rehabilitation, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA 1197, 1200-01 (1991) (Proposal 2):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an employee makes a voluntary admission and demonstrates continued successful participation in a rehabilitation program, his/her return to duty in a sensitive position may be considered as not endangering public health, safety, or national security. Every effort will be made to continue the employee in a position consistent with the protection of public health, safety, and national security.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span> was negotiable (only the last sentence was disputed), 39 FLRA at 1203-06:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Agency interprets Proposal 2 as establishing, as a norm, the retention of a confessed drug user in the sensitive position he or she occupied at the time the employee admitted to using illegal drugs. The Agency's construction is based on the use of the word "continue" in the proposal's disputed sentence. The Agency states that the inclusion of that word in the proposal "limits the interpretation of the phrase 'in a position consistent with the protection of public health, safety and national security' to the position that the employee occupies...since the employee would not 'continue' in a position that he or she was not already occupying."... The Agency notes, in this regard that section 5(c) of the Executive Order provides that "[a]gencies shall not allow any employee to remain on duty in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs, prior to the successful completion of rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Agency's interpretation of Proposal 2 were correct, the proposal would conflict with section 5(c) of the Executive Order. However, we reject that interpretation of the proposal. In our view, the proposal's first sentence, which is not in dispute, acknowledges the Executive Order's mandate to remove an identified drug user from the sensitive position he or she occupies. In fact, that sentence specifically refers to an employees [sic] "return to duty in a sensitive position...." Further, the first sentence provides only that an affected employee "may be considered as not endangering public health, safety, or national security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed second sentence of Proposal 2 would require the Agency to make "[e]very effort" to "continue the employee in a position consistent with the protection of public health, safety and national security." When the two sentences of the proposal are read together, it is clear that the employees referred to in the second sentence are those described in the first sentence. That is, the second sentence refers to employees who are returning to duty after successful participation in a rehabilitation program. It is clear also that unlike the first sentence, which refers to a sensitive position, the disputed second sentence refers to "a position consistent with the protection of public health, safety and national security."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states, in this regard, that the proposal means that an employee who voluntarily admits to drug use "will not be automatically deemed unsuitable to continue in a sensitive position, which could be either <span id="page_820"></span>the employee's position of record or another sensitive position."... The Union's explanation is consistent with the proposal's wording and, therefore, we adopt it for purposes of this analysis. Accordingly, based on the plain wording of the two sentences, and the Union's statement, we conclude that the disputed second sentence requires the Agency to make efforts to continue to employ an affected employee in a position which, consistent with the Agency's determination, is consistent with public health, safety, and national security. That is, the proposal would require the Agency to attempt to locate a position for which, in its judgment, the employee is qualified and to which the employee can be assigned without compromise to public health, safety, and national security and to consider the affected employee for placement in that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency may determine that the affected employee may continue in the sensitive position he or she encumbered prior to removal, the proposal would not require the Agency to do so. Moreover, the proposal would not require the Agency to place an employee returning from a rehabilitation program in a sensitive position. The Union specifically states, in this regard, that the Agency would be free under the proposal to reassign the employee out of his/her previous sensitive position to another sensitive position or nonsensitive position, or to take other appropriate personnel action.... [W]e conclude that the disputed portion of Proposal 2 does not directly interfere with management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject also the Agency's contention that the proposal would give arbitrators subject matter jurisdiction over security matters in violation of the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court held that agencies have exclusive discretion under law to grant or deny security clearances and that the exercise of such discretion is not reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). The limitations imposed by <span class="Italic">Egan</span> apply also to arbitration under a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">United States Information Agency and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1812</span>, 32 FLRA 739, 745-46 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the plain wording of Proposal 2 addresses the Agency's right to deny or revoke security clearances. Accordingly, the Agency would be free under the proposal to exercise the full range of its discretion regarding security clearances for affected employees. Moreover, if an affected employee's security clearance were revoked, the employee would be ineligible for consideration for assignment to positions requiring such clearances. There is, therefore, no basis on which to conclude that the proposal would grant arbitrators authority to review the substance of Agency decisions regarding security clearances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the Agency's decision to deny or revoke a security clearance were indirectly involved in a grievance under Proposal 2, such limited review is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. In fact, as the Court stated in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, review of an agency's decision concerning a security clearance properly may extend to, among other things, whether "transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible." 484 U.S. at 530. In this regard, as noted previously, the Agency is free to determine whether the position in which an employee may be placed under the disputed second sentence of Proposal 2 is "consistent with the protection of public health, safety and national security." Consistent with the Union's statement of intent, the position need not be a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, although an agency's decision to grant, deny or revoke a security clearance is not subject to review under a negotiated grievance procedure, the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision does not foreclose examination of other issues not related to the merits of an agency's clearance determination, including the feasibility of an affected employee's reassignment. Therefore, we reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is nonnegotiable because it might subject security issues to arbitration in violation of the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> holding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 2 does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106 of the Statute.... With regard to the proposal's possible interference with other management rights, we note that the proposal enables the Agency to decide whether to fill a position, to establish the qualifications necessary to perform the work of a position, and to determine whether an affected employee qualifies for a position....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 904, 906 (1991) (negotiable: portion of Proposal 11 that employer would not require employees to participate in voluntary drug testing programs; nonnegotiable: section of the proposal stating that participation or nonparticipation in voluntary program would "neither advantage [n]or disadvantage employees").</p>
<p class="noindent">As to sensitive positions, FLRA permitted the negotiation of another proposal concerning rehabilitation, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 39 FLRA 1197, 1198 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7.I. When a record exists of illegal drug use and an employee has successfully completed rehabilitation and thereafter refrains from drug use and tests negative, that employee will not be eliminated as an otherwise qualified candidate for a sensitive unit position.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span> explained, 39 FLRA at 1199-1200:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 provides that an employee who successfully completes a rehabilitation program, subsequently refrains from using illegal drugs, and continues to test negative for illegal drug usage, will not be eliminated from competing for a sensitive unit vacancy, if the employee is otherwise qualified for the position. The Union argues that the proposal "allows the employing Agency to consider the employee's record of successful rehabilitation but does not require that the employing Agency select the employee for any position, sensitive or non-sensitive."... The Agency, however, argues that the proposal limits its ability to weigh the trustworthiness of a rehabilitated drug user in deciding whether to assign the employee to a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its petition for review, the Union states that "it is well-established that an Agency selecting official has extensive discretion to select from among a properly ranked and certified group of eligibles; nothing in Proposal 1 would conflict with any independently-existing right to select, because Proposal 1 addresses only procedures for considering employees and does not mandate that any particular applicant for promotion be selected."... In light of the Union's explanation, which is consistent with the proposal's wording, we conclude that Proposal 1 would not require a selecting official to disregard a rehabilitated candidate's history of drug abuse in weighing that employee's relative standing among applicants for a vacancy in a sensitive position. Rather, as the Union points out, "if an employee referred for promotion or reassignment to a sensitive position were unsuitable for any reason, then Proposal 1 would not require the [Agency] to select the employee in violation of its right to select employees for promotion or of its right to determine its internal security practices."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Construed consistent with the proposal's plain wording and the Union's statement of intent, Proposal 1 would merely require the Agency to consider rehabilitated drug users for vacancies if they possess the requisite qualifications for those positions. The proposal would not require the selection of such employees for sensitive positions, and would not prohibit a selecting official from considering prior drug use when making a selection. Moreover, the proposal would not affect the Agency's discretion to establish qualifications for positions and assess applicants' qualifications for positions. The proposal requires only that the Agency consider rehabilitated drug users who are otherwise qualified for the vacancy together with other qualified applicants. Consequently, we find no basis on which to conclude that the proposal directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute. We note, in this regard, that the Agency's concern that an arbitrator's judgment may be substituted for its own is not a basis for precluding negotiation over Proposal 1....</p>
<p class="noindent">A "safe harbor" proposal was negotiable as an arrangement, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1692 and Dept. of Air Force, Mather AFB</span>, 40 FLRA 868, 869 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Illegal Drug Use Problems</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To complement the effort of the EAP to eliminate the adverse effects of illegal drug use in the workplace and ensure compliance with Executive Order 12564, a voluntary referral procedure is established to encourage illegal drug users to seek counseling and rehabilitation without the risk of disciplinary action. This is referred to as providing the employee "safe harbor." Accordingly, any employee who voluntarily identifies himself or herself as a user of illegal drugs will be provided "safe harbor" and be exempt from disciplinary action for the admitted acts of illegal drug use, including possession incidental to such use, provided the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Voluntarily makes such disclosure to a superior official prior to being identified through other means.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Obtain[s] counseling and rehabilitation through EAP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Agrees to be tested by the activity during counseling and rehabilitation and during the post-treatment and evaluation phase.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;Consents, in writing, to the release of all records related to counseling and rehabilitation, including urinalysis test results, to appropriate management and EAP officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5.&#x2003;Thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the negotiability of the proposal in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1692,</span> FLRA reasoned, 40 FLRA at 873-75:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...To determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must determine whether the proposal is: (1) intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the proposal is an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, according to the Union, the proposal is intended to "shield" from the adverse effects of disciplinary action those employees who voluntarily cooperate with the Agency's drug testing program and who undertake rehabilitation.... The Union explains that removing the threat of discipline benefits employees by <span id="page_821"></span>eliminating a disincentive for employees to admit their drug usage and to participate in an EAP. We find, therefore, that the proposal constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the proposal is an "appropriate" arrangement, we weigh the effect of the proposal on management's right to discipline against the benefits to employees that result from the proposal in order to determine whether the proposal excessively interferes with the right to discipline.... We conclude that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal applies only to employees who voluntarily admit that they use, or have used, illegal drugs and thus would not preclude discipline against employees who are found through the drug testing program to be using illegal drugs. By its plain wording, the proposal covers only the illegal use of drugs or possession incidental to that use and does not immunize employees from discipline on any other ground, including conduct related to or resulting from the use of illegal drugs or actions unrelated to the use of illegal drugs. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>, 32 FLRA at 275-76 (proposal immunizing employees from discipline for acts or omissions resulting from illegal drug use if they enroll in a drug rehabilitation program held nonnegotiable). Moreover, the proposal does not preclude disciplinary action against the employee if the employee is subsequently found to be using illegal drugs. The burden imposed by the proposal on management's right to discipline is therefore limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, by exempting employees from discipline, the proposal affords employees a benefit by providing them with a significant incentive voluntarily to disclose to management that they use, or have used, illegal drugs and to enter counseling and rehabilitation. In addition, as the Union indicates, Federal personnel policy encourages the suspension of disciplinary action to permit the employee to complete rehabilitation and return to a satisfactory performance level.... On balance, therefore, we find that the benefit to employees under the proposal of being exempt from discipline if they voluntarily disclose that they use illegal drugs, enter rehabilitation, and refrain from using drugs thereafter outweighs the burden imposed by the proposal on management's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 64 FLRA 355 (2009), a ULP case, considered, against a management rights defense to a contract repudiation case, the validity of a safe haven provision that provided, in part (the complete contract provision is included as an appendix to the decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Employer will retain employees in a duty or approved leave status while undergoing rehabilitation.&#x2003;If placed in a non-duty status, the employee will normally be returned to duty after successful completion of rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The provision was negotiable as an arrangement in <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan,</span> 64 FLRA at 358-60:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that the relevant provisions, as interpreted by the Judge, impermissibly affect management's right to discipline and, therefore, that failure to comply with them does not constitute repudiation. The GC argues that the provisions are enforceable as appropriate arrangements for employees affected by the exercise of management's right to discipline. As there is no dispute that &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement affect the right to discipline we address whether they constitute appropriate arrangements for the exercise of that right, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Assoc., AFL-CIO, </span>62 FLRA 174, 180 (2007).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Nat'l Assoc. of Gov't Employees, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG).</span> Under this framework, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 31. A provision constitutes an arrangement if it is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Fed. Aviation Admin., Wash., D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 1233, 1236-37 (2000). If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent concedes that the provisions are arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute, as they "tend to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the [Respondent's] decision to discipline employees who are found to test positive for illegal drugs." Therefore, we find that &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement constitute arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by management's right to discipline employees because they restrict the Respondent's ability to remove employees from employment while they are engaged in rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to whether the arrangements are "appropriate" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), an arrangement excessively interferes with management's rights--and is therefore not appropriate--if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the intrusion on the exercise of those rights. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Bd. of Veterans Appeals, </span>61 FLRA 422, 425 (2005). As noted by the court in <span class="Italic">Local 2924,</span> &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement protect from removal "a narrow class of employees for a limited period of time so that they may focus on treatment and rehabilitation."<span class="Italic"> Local 2924, </span>470 F.3d at 383. The court found that the provisions create a "safe harbor" that not only limits removal, but also provides protection for job security and promotional opportunities. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 382. However, the court also found that the relevant provisions do not: protect employees who refuse or fail to complete rehabilitation or who are subject to removal for reasons apart from their drug problem; foreclose any other kind of discipline short of dismissal during this period of time; or prohibit removal indefinitely. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Davis-Monthan,</span> 60 FLRA at 918 (judge's finding that provisions only affected right of removal during rehabilitation). Thus, the benefits afforded to employees under &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement are significant, and the burdens on the Respondent are relatively limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, Section 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement, as interpreted by the Judge and the court, are similar to a proposal that the Authority found to be an appropriate arrangement in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>43 FLRA 1279, 1303-08 (1992) <span class="Italic">(NTEU). </span>The proposal at issue in<span class="Italic"> NTEU </span>required a stay of disciplinary or adverse action against an employee found to have used illegal drugs until 90 days had passed or a negotiated grievance or statutory appeals procedure was completed, whichever came first. The Authority found that the proposal did not excessively interfere with management's right to discipline employees because the agency was not restricted from disciplinary action for misconduct beyond illegal drug use.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 1307-08. <span class="Italic">Cf. Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates &#x0026; Pilots, Pan. Canal Pilots Branch, </span>32 FLRA 269, 275 (1988) <span class="Italic">(Pan. Canal Pilots) </span>(proposal precluding all discipline for employees during and after successful rehabilitation excessively interfered with management rights); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2058, </span>31 FLRA 241, 248-49 (1988) (proposal prohibiting removal of employees participating in rehabilitation "would be negotiable" if it were revised "to concern only removal on grounds of the initial finding of drug abuse"). Consistent with the foregoing, as the relevant disciplinary provisions in this case are limited to removals for drug abuse for a finite period of time, we find that they do not excessively interfere with management's rights to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that all of the arguments raised by the Respondent assume that the disciplinary limitations found in &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement have a much broader application than that found by the Judge and the court. As such, these arguments do not support a finding that the relevant provisions, which are narrowly tailored to a specific group of employees for a limited period of time, excessively interfere with management's rights. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has not established that the Judge's decision is contrary to management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Relevant Provisions of the Parties' Agreements Are Not Contrary to Executive Order 12564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement, as interpreted by the Judge, are unenforceable because they are contrary to &#x00A7; 5(d) of Executive Order 12564. In this regard, the Respondent contends that, under these agreement provisions, it would be unable to remove employees who do not refrain from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that are contrary to Executive Order 12564 are contrary to law and therefore, unenforceable under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1655,</span> 49 FLRA 874, 889 (1994). The Authority has found that &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order requires agencies to initiate removal actions against any employee who, after being found to use illegal drugs, refuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation, or does not refrain from using illegal drugs. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1665,</span> 49 FLRA at 889. The Authority has also found that proposals permitting agencies to initiate adverse actions against employees who continue using drugs following rehabilitation are not contrary to &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 738, </span>38 FLRA 1203, 1213-14 (1990) (Member Talkin dissenting as to other matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 9 of the Local Drug Agreement is consistent with &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order in that it does not bar the removal of an employee who fails to remain drug-free. Article 27 of the parties' agreement, which requires the discipline of employees who do not <span class="Italic">"successfully </span>complete a rehabilitation program," is consistent with &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order for the same reason. <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan, </span>60 FLRA at 903 (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See Pan. Canal Pilots Branch, </span>32 FLRA at 276 (proposal not contrary to &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order because it would not bar the agency from removing an employee who failed to complete rehabilitation). Further, <span id="page_822"></span>the Respondent cites nothing in the relevant provisions of the parties' agreements that would bar the Respondent from implementing &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order. For these reasons, we find that Article 27 of the parties' agreement and &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement are not contrary to Executive Order 12564 and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 41 FLRA 1106, 1137, 1139-41 (1991), ruled negotiable Provision 10: "No employee shall be disciplined who voluntarily admits his or her drug use, completes counseling or an EAP, and thereafter refrains from drug use. The Employer is not precluded from administering discipline for reasons unrelated to the admission of drug use."
