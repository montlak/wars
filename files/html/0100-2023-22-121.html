<p class="Body-Text">"The integrity of the Merit Systems administrative process requires that the Board's Orders be respected, and compliance enforced. The interest of justice is served by the award of attorney fees when the agency delays its compliance beyond the date set by order of the Board." <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 981 F.2d 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 635, 643 &#x00B6; 16 (2000) (breach of confidentiality and back pay provisions of settlement agreement). We treat the terms "enforcement" and "compliance" interchangeably in the discussion that follows. [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-130.html#sec16-128">Enforcement of MSPB Decision</a>," concerning enforcement petitions involving Board orders and settlements entered into the Board record for enforcement.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees are awarded for work in enforcement proceedings. The fees may be justified for efforts to correct an agency's noncompliance, even if fees are not justified for disposition of the underlying successful appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ybarra v. DLA</span>, 25 MSPR 419, 422 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Arthur v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 341, 343 (1985) (award of fees for the underlying fees did not bar another fee award for compliance efforts). The entry of OPM as a party seeking reconsideration or stay does not make an agency's failure to comply justifiable. <span class="Italic">Tri v. SEC</span>, 27 MSPR 474, 476 (1985); <span class="Italic">Alfaro v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 26 MSPR 347, 349 n.1 (1985) (fees awarded for an enforcement action: an appellant who prevails on the portion of a claim then before the Board may be considered a prevailing party as to that claim). Fees may even be appropriate if an enforcement petition becomes moot by events following its initiation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mynard v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MYNARD_DON_A_DA_0831_06_0436_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_313430.pdf">108 MSPR 58</a>, 2008 MSPB 23 (2008) (extensive decision finding that fees for enforcement could be paid despite the mootness of the enforcement proceeding resulting from the agency's eventual compliance; fees could be ordered without the necessity of a formal decision from the AJ or a Board-approved settlement resolving compliance issues); <span class="Italic">LaBatte v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 58 MSPR 586, 593 (1993) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 981 F.2d 528 (Fed. Cir. 1992)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 689, 691 (1991) (enforcement petition mooted by compliance "does not preclude the appellant from establishing in support of an attorney fee motion that he is entitled to attorney fees because the agency complied with the Board's order on the merits as a result of his filing the instant petition for enforcement").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"When an agency delays its compliance beyond a date set by a Board order or a settlement agreement, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have found that the interest of justice is served by the award of attorneys fees." <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 72 MSPR 55, 61-62 (1996), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 331, 337-38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2000); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 72 MSPR 676, 679 (1996) (suggesting the possibility of counsel fees when an agency delays compliance beyond the date set by the parties' settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Doiron v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 170, 173 (1995) (fees may be appropriate if the agency has delayed its compliance beyond the time set in an AJ's order). Fees may be appropriate as to some but not all issues in a compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Foley v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 413, 419 n.8 (1993) (agency's compliance with a final Board order with respect to back pay does not prevent the appellant from being deemed a prevailing party as to a totally discrete compliance issue of the contents of an OPF); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Briseno v. VA</span>, SF-0752-13-0014-A-1 (NP 11/20/2014) ("The administrative judge also correctly stated that the interest of justice is generally served by an award of attorney fees when the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail in an enforcement proceeding. We likewise agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency knew or should have known it was in material breach of the agreement and would not prevail.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit confirmed the availability of fees for efforts to enforce a Board order, even if the compliance issues are resolved without the necessity of a Board decision on the enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">Mynard v. OPM</span>, 348 Fed. Appx. 582, 586-88 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), reviewing a fee request for enforcement work following an underlying appeal leading to a Board order correcting an annuity reduction, determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mynard also argues that he should be granted attorney fees for work performed during the enforcement phase in preparing his petition for enforcement. The government contends that his argument in that regard is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon.</span> In that case, which has been held applicable to fee applications before the Board, <span class="Italic">see Sacco v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 317 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the Supreme Court held that a change in conduct that may have been prompted by the lawsuit but was not the result of a court order lacked "the necessary judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur</span> on the change" to render the plaintiff a "prevailing party" for purposes of an attorney fee award. The government argues that <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>'s holding that "prevailing party" status can be obtained only where there is a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties means that "the mere filing of a PFE in a board case, as a stand alone action, does not materially alter 'the legal relationship of the parties,' so as to confer 'prevailing party' status upon the filer." The government relies on various precedents of this court recognizing the <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> rule that prevailing party status is obtained only if there is "an actual, court-ordered alteration in the legal relationship [between] the parties." <span class="Italic">Chapman Law Firm Co. v. Greenleaf Constr. Co.,</span> 490 F.3d 934, 939 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">see also Rice Servs., Ltd. v. United States,</span> 405 F.3d 1017, 1025 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. United States,</span> 288 F.3d 1371, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003). However, none of the cases the government cites deals with a situation in which attorney fees are requested for work performed in enforcing a prior judgment that altered the legal relationship between the parties, as is the case here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[A] compliance proceeding is a continuation of the original action." <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1988). As the Board noted in this case,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he type of decisions the Board and its administrative judges may issue during the compliance phase of an appeal are not themselves enforceable decisions that alter the legal relationships of the parties; rather, the Board's role in the compliance phase of an appeal is to determine whether the parties' actions are in compliance with a Board order or a settlement agreement that altered the legal relationship of the parties during the merits phase of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, courts have looked to the entirety of the appeal, including the merits phase, to determine whether attorney fees are appropriate for work performed during the enforcement phase. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. City of Tulsa, Okla.,</span> 489 F.3d 1089 (10th Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Cody v. Hillard,</span> 304 F.3d 767 (8th Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Blackman v. Dist. of Columbia,</span> 328 F. Supp.2d 36 (D.D.C. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cody,</span> the Eighth Circuit determined that attorney fees could be granted for work performed in monitoring a private settlement agreement between a class of South Dakota prisoners and the state. The court reasoned that the initial consent decree effected the necessary court-ordered alteration in the legal relationship between the parties and that the "earlier established prevailing party status extends to postjudgment work...if it is a necessary adjunct to the initial litigation." 304 F.3d at 773. The court explained, "[t]he test is whether the later issues litigated were inextricably intertwined with those on which the plaintiff prevailed in the underlying suit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> "Reasonable postjudgment monitoring," the court held, is compensable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 774. In <span class="Italic">Blackman,</span> the district court applied that standard and awarded fees for enforcement efforts associated with an earlier order, explaining that "an effort to secure a remedy through Court-established procedures is--and must be--inextricably intertwined with the Court's conclusion that the violation existed in the first instance. Otherwise, the Opinion and Order...is plaintiffs' victory in paper only." 328 F. Supp.2d at 45.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Johnson,</span> the Tenth Circuit rejected the argument that <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> requires a separate court order or decree related to post-judgment enforcement in order for a party to be considered a "prevailing party" for purposes of awarding attorney fees. 489 F.3d at 1103. The court held that measures that a party finds necessary to enforce a court's remedy cannot be divorced from the proceedings that led to obtaining that remedy, and that an attorney fee award is available for enforcement activities that are necessary to protect a judicially enforceable consent decree. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1105, <span class="Italic">citing Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens' Council for Clear Air,</span> 478 U.S. 546 (1986). Thus, the court concluded, when there is an earlier judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship, "attorney fees incurred for reasonable efforts to enforce that change--that is, protect the fruits of the Decree--are compensable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1108. Together, these decisions establish that a court's authority to enforce its orders gives judicial imprimatur to reasonable enforcement efforts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government attempts to distinguish those cases on the ground that each involved an underlying consent decree or enforceable judgment and that no such court-ordered change is present here. But that argument ignores the fact that the Board ordered OPM to provide Mr. Mynard with an opportunity to make a deposit into his CSRS account within 20 days and to inform him in writing of all actions taken to comply with the Board's order. Like a court, the Board has authority to order corrective action when it determines that a party is not in compliance with a Board order. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 732-33 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The Board's order of August 28, 2006, effected the required change in the relationship between the parties, and the subsequent enforcement efforts are compensable because they are linked to that order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that in <span class="Italic">Christina A. v. Bloomberg,</span> 315 F.3d 990 (8th Cir. 2003), the Eighth Circuit rejected the argument Mr. Mynard presents here. In <span class="Italic">Christina A.,</span> the court held that a court's enforcement jurisdiction over a private settlement agreement "is not enough to establish a judicial <span class="Italic">'imprimatur</span>' on the settlement contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 993. However, the court in that case specifically distinguished the enforcement of a private settlement agreement from the enforcement of a consent decree, noting that "consent decrees are distinguishable from private settlements by the means of enforcement. Consent decrees are enforceable through the supervising court's exercise of its contempt powers, and private settlements are enforceable only through a new action for breach of contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Unlike in <span class="Italic">Christina A.</span>, where the parties had independently agreed to alter their behavior, in this case the Board directly ordered the change in OPM's relationship with Mr. Mynard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the fee request for the enforcement efforts, the administrative judge found that OPM was substantially in compliance with the August 28, 2006, order based upon OPM's assertion that prior to the 20-day time limitation in the order it had sent forms to the Defense Finance Accounting Service to obtain the information needed to comply with the order. While the agency representative stated to the Board that OPM had initiated compliance efforts shortly after the Board's order became final, OPM did not set a time limit for Mr. Mynard to make a deposit for his military service within 20 days of the order becoming final, and it failed to keep him informed of the steps it had taken to comply with the Board's order, as the order directed. Therefore, even if the steps taken by OPM constituted partial compliance with the order, it is clear that those steps did not satisfy each of the requirements set forth in the order. Indeed, the government concedes that this court may conclude that there is not substantial evidence to support the finding that that OPM was in substantial compliance with the August 28, 2006, order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Mynard is a prevailing party, in order to secure fees he must also establish that an award is "warranted in the interest of justice." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). The steps OPM took on October 4, 2006, in response to the Board's order may be pertinent to that issue. Thus, having concluded that there is not substantial evidence supporting a finding that OPM complied with the Board's order, we remand to the Board for further proceedings to determine whether a fee award is warranted in the interest of justice, and if so to determine the appropriate amount of the award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The interest of justice component of a fee award in enforcement proceedings was noted in <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 122 MSPR 687, 694-95 &#x00B6; 12, 2015 MSPB 56 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the interest of justice, the Board generally will find that an attorney fee award is warranted in the interest of justice when: (1) the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434-35 (1980). Here, the third <span class="Italic">Allen</span> prong applies, because our finding of noncompliance was explicitly based on a finding that the agency failed to comply with the settlement agreement in good faith. It is true that the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines are not exhaustive, and the agency correctly observes that a fee award may not be warranted in the interest of justice where the relief obtained is <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">See Sterner v. Department of the Army,</span> 711 F.2d 1563, 1567-68 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In this case, however, the appellant received substantial relief, i.e., the agency's compliance with section 1(g), a material term of the settlement agreement. We therefore discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that a fee award is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To be a prevailing party in an enforcement proceeding based on a settlement, the appellant must show that the (a) agency was in noncompliance, (b) with a material term of a settlement agreement that was entered into the record for enforcement purposes, and (c) the relief as to the matter at issue was causally related to the initiation of enforcement proceedings before the Board. To establish that she is a prevailing party, the appellant need not demonstrate that the agency's error was intentional or in bad faith. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 331, 340 &#x00B6; 17 (2000) (breach of confidentiality provision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-11-0696-A-1 (NP 2/25/2015) ("Although the agency's action regarding the appellant's appraisals which prompted this order did constitute noncompliance with the Board's earlier order to retroactively restore her to a GS-13 position, we find that it was at most a technical, not a material breach, inasmuch as the relief the appellant sought in filing the petition for enforcement was to be restored to a position at a grade higher than a GS-13. Because she was not successful in that respect, she failed to establish that she was a prevailing party in the compliance phase of the proceedings and is therefore not eligible for payment for attorney fees incurred during that phase of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shelton,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 177, &#x00B6; 23.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prevailing party status, and related entitlement to counsel fees, depends on some relief being achieved through enforcement proceedings.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), the U.S. Supreme Court held that, to be considered a prevailing party for purposes of a fee-shifting statute, a party must have "obtained an enforceable judgment" resulting in a "material alteration of the legal relationship" between the parties. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). Applying the standard articulated in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the Board has held that an appellant who shows that she obtained a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties through an enforceable final judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement entered into the record for purposes of enforcement by the Board is a "prevailing party" for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has addressed whether an appellant is eligible for a separate attorney fees award as a prevailing party in a compliance or enforcement proceeding before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Shelton v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 177, &#x00B6; 12 (2010); <span class="Italic">Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2008). In <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the Board discussed the impact of Buckhannon on an appellant's eligibility to receive a fee award in a petition for enforcement, and it held that a party may achieve "prevailing party" status without obtaining an enforceable judgment on the merits of the compliance proceeding so long as the relief the party achieves carries with it sufficient Board imprimatur. 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 16. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the Board found that its oversight of the parties' compliance efforts provides the petition for enforcement process with sufficient Board imprimatur to allow an appellant to secure <span id="Page_4653"></span>prevailing party status under section 7701(g)(1) even in the absence of either a Board order finding the agency in noncompliance or an agreement executed by the parties to settle the compliance matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant is not a prevailing party in the compliance proceeding under section 7701(g)(1).</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these standards, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant is not a prevailing party in the compliance proceeding under section 7701(g)(1). Although the Board has found that an appellant need not secure a final Board order to qualify as a prevailing party in a compliance proceeding, <span class="Italic">see Mynard,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 17, here, the parties did not mutually resolve the compliance proceeding before the Board could issue a final order. Rather, the administrative judge denied the appellant's petition for enforcement on its merits, and the Board affirmed the administrative judge's denial, agreeing that there was no order that the agency had failed to honor and finding the agency in compliance.[3] Under these facts, we agree with the administrative judge that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mynard,</span> and that as to the compliance proceeding, the appellant did not achieve any degree of relief that could make her a prevailing party for purposes of recovering the attorney fees she incurred during that proceeding. Because the appellant's compliance proceeding did not bring about a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties, and because that proceeding was resolved in the agency's favor with a finding of agency compliance both before the administrative judge and before the Board on petition for review, we agree that the appellant is not a prevailing party entitled to an award of fees incurred during the course of the compliance proceeding under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the Board followed the decisions of several Federal courts of appeal that had distinguished Buckhannon in cases where a party seeks to enforce a court order, but is able to resolve the dispute before the court can render a judgment in the enforcement proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 15-17.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fee awards are not automatic in enforcement actions: a causal relation must be shown between the initiation of compliance proceedings and the results achieved. <span class="Italic">Wade v.

A settlement agreement that provides for counsel fees as part of the resolution of an appeal on the merits would not ordinarily provide for fees for compliance.

When fees are sought by reason of successful enforcement proceedings involving a settlement, the fees should be requested through a fee petition, through Board regulations governing fee petitions, not as part of the pleadings involved in resolution of the enforcement dispute. The fee petition is a separate pleading. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fowler v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 80, 87 &#x00B6; 19, 2006 MSPB 239 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When, during Board consideration of an AJ's enforcement recommendations, the agency brings itself into compliance with a settlement, the Board will dismiss the enforcement petition and the appellant may then file a fee motion with the AJ in accordance with the regulation governing fee requests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bruno v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Kessler v. USDA</span>, 37 MSPR 471 (1988), an appeal successfully challenging a removal for unacceptable performance, counsel was awarded fees for his defense of the removal. Counsel then petitioned for fees incurred during enforcement proceedings. The Board treated the enforcement proceeding as a matter divorced from the underlying appeal and denied fees because it determined that the agency's delay in achieving compliance resulted from circumstances beyond its control--reliance on information from OPM. The agency "complied as soon as it could." Appellant moved for compliance "only nine days after the agency was technically in noncompliance with the Board's order and nothing indicate[d] that the agency was not processing the backpay award as rapidly as possible under [the] circumstances." The approach in <span class="Italic">Kessler</span> is debatable. If the appellant does not move for compliance when the agency has missed its time limit, the appellant's remedy is delayed and the agency's delay may continue. The agency can avoid the problem by requesting an extension of time for compliance, but the burden should not be on the appellant of waiting out the agency at the risk of moving too quickly and failing to obtain counsel fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Helping the Board to ensure an award of counsel fees when enforcement proceedings are justified, the Federal Circuit recognized in <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 561 (Fed. Cir. 1988), that "a successful defense necessarily included the compliance proceeding." Under <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, relying on <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732 (Fed. Cir. 1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a compliance proceeding "is not an original 'personnel action.'"...&#8197;Rather, a compliance proceeding is a continuation of the original action. Justification for the proceeding is established if the board finds it necessary to issue a compliance order....&#8197;In essence, then, petitioner was forced to petition for compliance in order to restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. The compliance proceeding was clearly a part of petitioner's continuing efforts to regain that which the improper removal had taken away....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not to say, however, that every compliance petition is justified, or that respondent should be forced to pay petitioner's attorney fees whether or not the claims in the petition are meritorious. Petitioner raised several issues in his compliance action, not all of which were decided favorably to him by the board. Respondent cannot be forced to pay attorney fees for those of petitioner's claims which were unjustified. Petitioner is not entitled to fees incurred because of his own error in interpreting the [settlement] agreement. Recovery of attorney fees is limited to those areas where respondent has been found in non-compliance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board tends to recognize that counsel fees are warranted to stop agency delay in compliance. No explicit finding of bad faith is required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

The interest of justice standard is met when the agency engages in delaying procedures rather than complying with a final Board order. The right to fees is not defeated if, after the enforcement petition is filed, the agency complies without a Board order. <span class="Italic">Harris v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute does not place on the petitioner the burden of proving what the agency would not have done, when the passing of the Board's deadline had already established noncompliance by the agency. The burden of compliance with the Board's Order was not upon Mr. Garstkiewicz, but upon the Postal Service. It is undisputed that payment was not made as the Board's Order required, and that the other provisions of the Board's Order were not complied with.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The integrity of the Merit Systems administrative process requires that the Board's Orders be respected, and compliance enforced.

Department of the Interior</span>, 72 MSPR 55, 59 (1996). Here, when the appellant filed his petition for enforcement, the agency, although it had apparently ordered the processing of attorney fees in the appellant's case, had not yet provided the appellant's attorney with his fee payment for the underlying action. Although the settlement agreement did not set forth a deadline by when the agency was to process the payment and by which the payment had to be made, the Board has found that when a settlement agreement does not set a time limit for compliance, the Board has authority to impose a reasonable time limit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received attorney fees in this case almost three months after the settlement agreement was entered into by the parties. The agency asserted that once it received a letter from the appellant and his petition for enforcement indicating that he had not received payment, "the agency responded promptly, discovered the administrative delay and ensured that payment was made on January 5, 1998." It is undisputed, however, that the agency's Human Resources department failed to act upon the agency's initial order to remit attorney fees to the appellant and that the agency did not respond to the appellant's December 2, 1997 letter regarding payment of the attorney fees. Furthermore, the agency's bare assertion that a petition for enforcement was unnecessary and that a telephone call to the agency would have sufficed to resolve the payment issue, does not explain either why the agency failed to respond to the appellant's December 2, 1997 letter regarding the attorney fees or why payment of the attorney fees did not occur until approximately one month after the appellant filed the petition for enforcement with the Board, i.e., almost three months after the settlement agreement was entered into by the parties. In fact, based upon the evidence of record, we believe that the agency took the requisite corrective action of paying the agreed upon attorney fees as a direct result of the appellant's filing of his petition for enforcement. We further find that the delay in actually making the payment was unreasonable. Because the appellant has shown that the agency was in noncompliance with a material term of the agreement, he was the prevailing party in the enforcement proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Del Balzo,</span> 72 MSPR at 61; <span class="Italic">Whaley,</span> 61 MSPR at 347; <span class="Italic">Foley,</span> 59 MSPR at 420 (the appellant is the prevailing party" in the enforcement proceeding at issue because he demonstrated below that his relief as to the matter at issue was causally related to the initiation of enforcement proceedings before the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency delays its compliance beyond a date set by a Board order or a settlement agreement, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have found that the interest of justice is served by the award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Garstkiewicz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 981 F.2d 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Del Balzo,</span> 72 MSPR at 61-62; <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, 61 MSPR at 347. Here, we have found that the settlement agreement required that the agency perform its obligations under the agreement within a reasonable period of time, and that the agency failed to meet this requirement. We therefore find that an award of attorney fees for the attorney's time on the enforcement petition is in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See Del Balzo</span>, 72 MSPR at 62....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 509, 511-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12 (1999), also emphasized that delay in compliance with a settlement will justify an award of fees for enforcement proceedings without a showing of bad faith:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In attorney fee motions based upon petitions for enforcement, the burden of proof is upon the agency to prove its compliance, rather than on the appellant to prove what the agency would not have done in the absence of his petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Del</span> <span class="Italic">Balzo v. Department of the Interior,</span> 72 MSPR 55, 59 (1996). Here, when the appellant filed his petition for enforcement, the agency had not yet provided the appellant's attorney with his fee payment for the underlying action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant received attorney fees in this case more than three months after the agency alleged that it received the itemized bill from the appellant in April 1998 and more than one month after the appellant filed his petition for enforcement. The agency asserted that it was confused by the appellant's attorney's April 1998 submission and believed that a "final" assessment of the fees would be forthcoming. According to the affidavit of one of the agency's Paralegal Specialists, when she had not received any further correspondence from the appellant's attorney, she called the attorney's office on or about June 10, 1998, and explained the situation to whomever answered the telephone. She further asserted that after the attorney did not call her back, she and the agency's Comptroller began to process the fees request in the amount of $3,500 because they realized that the fees would be at least that amount. The Comptroller asserted in her affidavit that she certified payment in the amount of $3,500 on June 23, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency argued that its processing of the fees award was in no way influenced by the appellant's petition for enforcement, the asserted certification of payment was made one week after the filing of the petition for enforcement. The agency further asserted that it did not know why the appellant's attorney did not receive the check for the attorney fees until July 24, 1998, and that he should have received the check no later than June 30, 1998. It contended that whatever delay occurred in receiving the check was unintentional and caused by "administrative delay that unfortunately seems endemic in governmental operations," and that any delay beyond June 30 was attributable to the Postal Service rather than to the agency. The agency's check, however, was not issued until July 22, 1998.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that there was no evidence that the appellant's attorney ever submitted to the agency a "totalized and itemized" bill as required by the settlement agreement and that the attorney's submission "did not clearly establish a final figure upon which the agency was required to act." She further found, relying only on the agency's assertions, that the agency's processing of the fees request was not influenced by the appellant's petition for enforcement, and on that basis found that the agency complied with the terms of the settlement agreement and that the appellant was not the prevailing party in the enforcement action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the agency's arguments and the administrative judge's findings unpersuasive. First, the letter attached to the April 1998 bill for attorney fees clearly indicated that the appellant's attorney was submitting a "rough draft" of his billing because it far exceeded the agreed upon amount of attorney fees, i.e., the $3,500 set forth in the settlement agreement. The bill was, in fact, an itemized description of the fees and expenses incurred regarding the appellants appeal. If the agency was genuinely confused or uncertain as to the amount of the fees to be paid, the reasonable course of action was to promptly inquire of the attorney. We do not find its action of waiting almost two months before calling and then issuing a check for $3,500 without any further clarification to be consistent with its asserted confusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, as noted above, the check was not issued until July 22, 1998, approximately three months after the itemized bill was submitted to the agency, more than one month after the appellant filed his petition for enforcement, and more than three weeks after the agency informed the appellant's attorney and the administrative judge that the check had been sent to the appellant's attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's contentions, in order to be deemed a "prevailing party" in an enforcement proceeding before the Board, an appellant is not required to demonstrate that an agency's failure to comply with a settlement agreement, which was entered into the record for enforcement purposes and therefore constitutes a final Board order, was intentional or based upon bad faith<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Foley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 59 MSPR 413, 418 (1993). Furthermore, both the agency and the administrative judge erroneously concluded that in order to be deemed a prevailing party, an appellant must demonstrate that his relief as to the matter at issue is causally related to the initiation of enforcement proceedings before the Board. Rather, in order to demonstrate that he is the prevailing party, the appellant must only show that the agency was not in compliance with a material term of the agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Garstkiewicz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 981 F.2d 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Del Balzo,</span> 72 MSPR at 61; <span class="Italic">Whaley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 340, 347 (1994). We find that the appellant is the prevailing party because he has made such a showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have found that when an agency delays its compliance beyond a date set by a Board order or a settlement agreement, the interest of justice is served by the award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz,</span> 981 F.2d at 530; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo,</span> 72 MSPR at 61-62; <span class="Italic">Whaley,</span> 61 MSPR at 347. In light of the delay in payment, we find that an award of attorney fees for the enforcement petition is in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See Del Balzo,</span> 72 MSPR at 62</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whaley v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 340, 344-47 (1994), harmonized approaches to fee recovery in proceedings to enforce Board remedial orders and settlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cuthbertson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 784 F.2d 370, 372-73 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the Federal Circuit adopted a "two factor" test to determine whether an appellant was a prevailing party for attorney fees purposes: (1) Whether the appellant obtained all or a significant part of the relief he sought from the Board; and (2) whether the relief was causally related to the initiation of the proceedings before the Board. Applying this test in <span class="Italic">Wade</span> [<span class="Italic">Wade v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 635 (1990)], the Board found that an employee who filed a petition for enforcement of an attorney fees award was not the prevailing party for purposes of an attorney fees award in connection with the enforcement petition because the agency's 23-day untimely payment of attorney fees was not causally <span id="Page_4655"></span>and significantly related to the initiation of the enforcement petition, inasmuch as the agency had started the process of payment on its own in a timely manner, and it could not be said that payment would not have been made in the absence of the compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Wade</span>, 45 MSPR at 636-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying <span class="Italic">Wade</span> to the instant attorney fees matter, the administrative judge found that the appellant was not the prevailing party because the agency's compliance with the settlement agreement was not causally related to the petition for enforcement, explaining as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he agency was only five weeks late in fully complying with the settlement agreement and the evidence reflects that the agency started the process of payment on its own in a timely manner prior to [the] appellant['s] initiating compliance proceedings before the Board. Thus, it cannot be said that payment would not have been made in the absence of the compliance proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the above reasoning, however, the court in <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> [<span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. USPS</span>, 981 F.2d 528 (Fed. Cir. 1992)] has plainly stated that "[t]he burden of compliance with the Board's Order [is] not upon [the appellant], but upon the [agency]." <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, 981 F.2d at 530. Therefore, we shall analyze herein the issue of attorney fee motions in enforcement proceedings in light of the court's clarification of the applicable burden of proof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the normal case where the Board reverses an agency action, the Board's Opinion and Order requires the agency to accomplish three things in compliance: (1) To pay backpay and interest within 60 days; (2) to pay any undisputed amount within 60 days in the event that there is a dispute about the total amount of backpay; and (3) to inform the appellant in writing of all actions taken to comply with the Board's order and of the date on which the agency believes it is in full compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, the court reversed the Board's determination that the appellant was not the prevailing party because the agency had not complied with any aspect of its order before the enforcement proceeding was filed<span class="Italic">. Garstkiewicz</span>, 981 F.2d at 530. The court found that the agency's claim that it had taken steps to comply by supplying salary information to the Postal Data Center (PDC) was not supported by the record. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court then stated that even had that initial step been timely taken, nothing else had been done on time; specifically, no action of partial compliance was taken, and no report of actions taken had been made to the appellant<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We view the court's use of the term "partial compliance" as referring to the second compliance item enumerated above, i.e., the payment of any undisputed amount of backpay and interest within 60 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court then stated that, even if the agency had made a timely submission to the PDC, the agency still would not be in compliance because of its failure to comply with the remainder of the Board's order<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Taking this statement by itself, one could argue that a timely submission to the PDC would suffice to establish compliance with the first compliance item, i.e., to pay backpay and interest within 60 days. The court went on to state, however, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The statute does not place on the petitioner the burden of proving what the agency would not have done, when the passing of the Board's deadline had already established noncompliance by the agency....&#8197;It is undisputed that payment was not made as the Board's order required....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, we hold that for attorney fees motions based upon attorneys' services in connection with petitions for enforcement, the burden of proof is upon the agency to prove its compliance, rather than upon the appellant to prove what the agency would not have done in the absence of his petition for enforcement. Insofar as <span class="Italic">Wade</span>, 45 MSPR 635, 637-38, is inconsistent with this Opinion and Order, it is hereby overruled (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> decision differs from the instant appeal in a significant way, however, in that <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> involved an agency's belated compliance with a date set in an administrative judge's order, while the instant matter involves the agency's belated compliance with a mutually-negotiated and agreed-upon date set in a settlement agreement. Here, as we have indicated, the parties' settlement agreement provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [agency] agrees that payment of back pay with interest and the appropriate adjustment to benefits will be made within thirty (30) days from the date this Stipulation and Settlement Agreement is signed by all parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement was signed by the appellant's representative on March 3, 1992 and by the appellant and by the agency's representative on March 6, 1992. Thus, the agency's compliance with the above provision was due, according to the agreement, on or before April 5, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency indisputably did not comply by the above payment term by April 5, 1992, nor had it complied therewith by April 27, 1992, the date that the appellant filed his petition for enforcement. Nevertheless, the administrative judge found that the appellant was not the prevailing party because the agency had taken steps on March 6, 1992, the same date that the parties entered into the settlement agreement, to <span class="Italic">start</span> the process of payment. This was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and its interpretation is a question of law. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In interpreting an agreement, the Board looks to the language used by the parties, and will not interpret that language in a way that unilaterally modifies the agreement's material terms. <span class="Italic">Zamora v. Department of Defense</span>, 58 MSPR 544, 546 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency could have contracted for some provision to protect itself against delays in processing the claim for backpay by the PDC, but it did not do so and the Board will not do so for it. In short, we find that the agreement does <span class="Italic">not</span> provide that the agency would submit salary information to the PDC within 30 days, but that it would <span class="Italic">pay</span> the appellant within 30 days. Thus, the agency was in clear violation of its contract with the appellant as of April 5, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result of the agency's violation of the settlement agreement, the appellant was entitled to submit a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 5 MSPB 289, 5 MSPR 248, 250 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586 (1989). Inasmuch as the appellant demonstrated below the agency's noncompliance with a material term of the parties' contractual agreement, he was the prevailing party in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, 981 F.2d at 530.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, as we indicated above, it is necessary for us to determine whether an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, the court stated that "[t]he interest of justice is served by the award of attorney fees when the agency delays its compliance beyond the date set by the Board." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that the court's reasoning logically extends to the situation here, where the agency has delayed its compliance beyond the time set by the parties' settlement agreement. We therefore find that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice<span class="Italic">. See id.; Patterson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 55 MSPR 499, 502 (1992) (the parties are bound by the terms of a settlement agreement, and the Board may not modify those terms through its decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant is thus entitled to an award of attorney fees based upon the enforcement action. The issue of the reasonableness of the amount of the requested attorney fees and costs thus remains to be determined. Generally, the administrative judge who decided an appeal on the merits is in the best position to evaluate the documentation submitted by counsel to determine whether the amount of fees requested is reasonable and to evaluate the quality of the representation afforded by counsel. <span class="Italic">See Wiatr v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 447 (1991); <span class="Italic">Sprenger v. Department of the Interior</span>, 34 MSPR 664, 669 (1987). Although this suspension appeal was not decided on the merits but, rather, was resolved by a settlement agreement, the administrative judge is, nevertheless, most familiar with the documentary record and with the quality and efficiency of the attorney's representation below. <span class="Italic">See Wiatr</span>, 50 MSPR at 447.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whaley</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Coon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 180, 185 (1994), awarding fees for efforts to secure the fruits of a settlement agreement--timely restoration of appellant to pay status--through a successful enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Evans v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 357, 359-60 (1995) (analogizing to compliance proceedings for a fee award analysis, the necessity to file a Board appeal to force OPM to pay an annuity that it had administratively approved); <span class="Italic">Olson v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 261, 266 (1994) (agency did not meet a settlement agreement's restoration provisions on time; belated compliance made the appellant prevailing party; a delay in compliance supported a conclusion that a fee award was in the interest of justice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Neal v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 207, 212-13 (1994), granted fees for time to remedy delayed compliance and denied fees for unproductive enforcement efforts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 981 F.2d 528 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the court held that the appellant was a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees where the agency had not complied with any aspect of the Board's final order before the appellant filed his enforcement proceeding. In reaching this conclusion, the court clarified the applicable burden of proof. It stated that the "statute does not place on the petitioner the burden of proving what the agency would not have done, when the passing of the Board's deadline had already established noncompliance by the agency.... It is undisputed that payment was not made as the Board's order required...." 981 F.2d at 530. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 340, 347 (1994), we held that, where attorney fees motions are based upon services rendered in connection with petitions for enforcement, the burden of proof is upon the agency to prove its compliance, rather than upon the appellant to prove what the agency would <span class="Italic">not</span> have done in the absence of the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, we further examined <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz's</span> application to an agency's belated compliance with a mutually-negotiated and agreed-upon <span id="Page_4656"></span>settlement. There, we found that, where a settlement requires an agency to accomplish a matter by a certain date, its failure to fully accomplish that matter by the specified date puts it in noncompliance with the agreement, and justifies an appellant's filing of a petition for enforcement. Where an appellant shows the agency's noncompliance with a material term of the settlement agreement, the appellant is the prevailing party for purposes of a later request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, at 347.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the parties' November 5, 1992 oral settlement agreement required the agency to restore the appellant to light duty and to conduct a search for a position that was within his medical restrictions. The administrative judge accepted that agreement into the record for enforcement purposes and dismissed the appeal as settled in an initial decision dated November 5, 1992. As discussed above, the appellant filed his first petition for enforcement on April 6, 1993, alleging that the agency had not returned him to work or begun its job search. The record shows that the agency did not return the appellant to duty until June 14, 1993, after the parties reached a settlement of this first enforcement petition. The agency has not shown that it had any basis for delaying the appellant's return to duty under the terms of the November 5, 1992 oral settlement. Under <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> and <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, the agency's belated compliance warrants the conclusion that the appellant is the prevailing party with respect to that enforcement action. <span class="Italic">See also Olson v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 261 (1994). The agency's delay in compliance also supports the conclusion that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">See Olson</span>, at 264; <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, at 347.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further, however, that the appellant is not a prevailing party with respect to the other two enforcement petitions. The essence of the appellant's second enforcement petition was his dissatisfaction with the agency's alleged efforts to impose its own terms in the written version of the November 5, 1992 oral settlement agreement. As the administrative judge correctly stated on several occasions, however, the terms of the oral settlement governed the case, and the written memorial was unnecessary and bestowed no additional rights upon the parties. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 590, 591-92 (1988). Thus, this was not a situation where the agency failed to accomplish a matter required by the settlement agreement, as in <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>. Further, this proceeding did not change the legal relationship between the parties that was created by the original settlement agreement, and the appellant cannot be deemed to have succeeded on any of the issues presented in this petition. <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 64 MSPR 100, 104-05 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the third enforcement petition, although the appellant had alleged that the agency was not in compliance with the original agreement, because it had not cleansed his official personnel file or granted him the within-grade increase in salary to which he was entitled, the parties ultimately agreed that the agency <span class="Italic">was</span> in compliance with respect to these matters. The appellant's remaining disagreement with the agency in this proceeding was again the inability to agree on a written version of the original oral settlement agreement. Their ultimate agreement on this matter in this final enforcement proceeding does not convey prevailing party status upon the appellant because, as with the second enforcement proceeding, the memorial of the oral settlement did not change the legal relationship between the parties, and the appellant cannot be deemed to have succeeded on the issues presented here. <span class="Italic">See Ray</span>, at 104-05.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The theories for recovery of fees occasionally may differ from one stage of the proceedings, the hearing on the merits, to the second stage, enforcement. Fees were awarded under the "gross procedural error" standard when enforced leave was reversed, and fees were awarded for enforcement proceedings under the discrimination laws. It was immaterial that the finding of discrimination resulted from the Board's treatment of the PFR rather than as a result of the findings of an AJ in an initial decision. In <span class="Italic">Cason v. NASA</span>, 46 MSPR 401, 404 (1990), the appellant prevailed on the merits of a challenge to enforced leave but the appellant did not prove disability discrimination. Compliance difficulties then developed as to the agency's failure to accommodate appellant's disability when he returned to work. As to a ruling on a request for counsel fees following successful prosecution of the disability discrimination claim at the level of a PFR, <span class="Italic">Cason</span> noted that the Board would rule on a discrimination claim that was first raised in the PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge's suggestion that the appellant erroneously filed the enforcement proceedings in order to obtain a finding of discrimination and should have sought that finding by filing a petition for review of the enforced leave initial decision is without merit. Although it would have been preferable for the appellant to have filed a petition for review of the initial decision on the merits, the Board finds that it was appropriate for him to argue the issue when the effects of the administrative judge's failure to rule on the matter were evident because of the agency's refusal to award back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 461, 463 (1987) (in reversing a period of enforced leave as a suspension, the administrative judge need not make a finding on whether the appellant is ready, willing, and able to work).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board sees no reason in this case that the appellant should be charged with foreseeing that, without a finding that the agency action was tainted with handicap discrimination, the agency would deny him back pay. Nor should the appellant be denied back pay because of the administrative judge's failure to address an issue that so significantly affected enforcement. Further, no economy of judicial resources is effected by resolution of the issue on petition for review rather than as a part of the enforcement action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not award fees requested for the first time at the Board level of review in an enforcement action. Fees incurred during the enforcement proceedings are properly requested by submission to the AJ after the Board's decision on the enforcement petition has become final. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Belmont v. USPS</span>, 109 MSPR 505, 508 &#x00B6; 8, 2008 MSPB 184 (2008). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-22-019.html#sec15-20">Enforcement Proceeding Mooted by Agency Action</a>."]</p>
