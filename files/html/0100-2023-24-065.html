<h3 class="h3" id="sec17-63"><span class="space">D.</span> DISCRIMINATION ISSUES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">In a Board appeal involving allegations of discrimination, including disability discrimination, judicial review of the final Board decision lies in the district courts. The federal trial courts also review associated allegations in mixed case lawsuits of improper determinations concerning civil service laws and regulations. In a mixed case (an appeal coupled with an allegation, constituting an affirmative defense, that the action was discriminatory in violation of civil rights laws), the appeal does not lie directly with a court of appeals if discrimination claims or defenses are presented to the court. 5 USC 7703(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. USPS</span>, 653 F.2d 219, 221 (5th Cir. 1981). A mixed case also includes an allegation of reprisal against an individual who exercises rights protected under the civil rights laws. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Horner</span>, 635 F. Supp. 323 (D.D.C. 1986)<span class="Italic">; cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fleming v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3775) (Federal Circuit lacked jurisdiction over an appeal predicated, in part, "on the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, one of the discrimination statutes identified in [5 USC] section 7702(a)(1)"); <span class="Italic">Long v. Frank</span>, 808 F. Supp. 961 (E.D.N.Y. 1992) (explaining when a district court, rather than the Federal Circuit, has jurisdiction to consider the elements of a case involving issues of discrimination). District court review extends to disputes over MSPB fee awards arising from mixed case appeals. <span class="Italic">Kean v. Stone</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/19911202926f2d27611159">926 F.2d 276</a>, 286-87 (3rd Cir. 1991) ("Moreover, the fact that Kean had prevailed before the MSPB on his claim of discrimination decisively shaped his further entitlement.... In short, we are not persuaded that, when Gary Kean prevailed before the MSPB on his claim of handicap discrimination and thereafter sought attorney fees, all questions of discrimination had dropped out of his case. To the contrary, the fact that Kean has prevailed on the merits of his discrimination claim shapes his entitlement, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(g)(2), to attorney fees 'in accordance with the standards under section 706(k).'"). [Refer later in this chapter to "Jurisdictional Issue; Constructive Adverse Action; <span class="Italic">Perry</span>."]</p> 
<p class="Body-Text">Incorrect statements by the Board of review rights in mixed cases have been addressed. In <span class="Italic">Oxman v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 333, 334 (1986), the Board apparently issued an incorrect notice of appeal rights directing the appellant to a district court for judicial review. The Board noted that the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction, but the Board bowed to the court's suggestion that the Board reopen the case for the limited purpose of issuing another final decision with a proper statement of judicial review rights. The Board reopened the decision to provide a judicially reviewable decision when the appellant's right to judicial review to the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A retirement-based appeal raising issues of discrimination against people in same-sex marriages is within the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction under a constitutional equal protection analysis, not a matter reserved to a district court under a discrimination theory. <span class="Italic">Hirschfield v. OPM</span>, 725 Fed. Appx. 934, 936 (Fed. Cir. 2018 NP). But a retirement appeal that includes an allegation of discrimination against OPM belongs in a district court, <span class="Italic">Ash v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/21-2194.ORDER.2-9-2022_1905709.pdf">25 F.4th 1009, 1011-12</a> (Fed. Cir. 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Usually, the serious adverse personnel action in a mixed case is employee termination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Lang v. MSPB</span>, 219 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Lang believed his termination was a discriminatory action.... Thus, Lang pled a mixed case complaint...."). Here, Mr. Ash challenges a different adverse action: a disability retirement decision. We have not directly spoken on this issue, so we take this opportunity to clarify that an appeal arising from a benefits decision can be a "personnel action" giving rise to a mixed case over which we do not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Removal is not the only adverse action that can create a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See Kloeckner</span>, 568 U.S. at 44 n.1 (listing other actions that an employee can appeal to the Board). Per 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(A), a challenge to an adverse agency personnel action can be a mixed case as long as the adverse action can be appealed to the Board. An OPM decision that adversely affects retirement "rights or benefits," like the decision that Mr. Ash appeals in this case, is a "personnel action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, 449 F.3d 1374, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Ash (1) raises an adverse personnel action that is appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board and (2) alleges discrimination. So, we conclude that this appeal is a mixed case over which we do not have jurisdiction. We therefore order this case transferred to the District of Maryland.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a disability retirement benefits appeal, <span class="Italic">Webb v. OPM</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim for disability retirement is not a discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dedrick v. Berry</span>, 573 F.3d 1278, 1280-81 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Although Ms. Webb claimed in some of her filings that her separation from federal service was due to a "medical condition," neither of those claims allege that the OPM decision challenged before the Board--the decision disallowing Ms. Webb's disability application--was based, in any part, on discriminatory grounds. <span class="Italic">See also Wallace v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 728 F.2d 1456, 1459 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("[W]e do not agree...that the mere pleading of discrimination totally precludes the exercise of jurisdiction by this court."). At no point has Ms. Webb alleged that OPM's disallowance of her disability retirement application was a "serious adverse action prompted, in whole or in part, by...[a] violation of federal antidiscrimination laws." <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, 137 S. Ct. at 1988. This determination is consistent with EEOC's denial of consideration of Ms. Webb's appeal of the same Board decision because the Board did not address a discrimination claim (and so, challenges to the Board's decision were outside EEOC's jurisdiction). <span class="Italic">EEOC Decision</span>, 2022 WL 3153856, at *1. Ms. Webb's appeal challenging the Board decision affirming the disallowance of her disability retirement application, therefore, is not a mixed case, so we have jurisdiction over her appeal under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). <span class="Italic">See also McLaughlin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 353 F.3d 1363, 1365 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2052 v. Reno</span>, 992 F.2d 331 (D.C.

"The law requires an aggrieved federal employee to elect one exclusive administrative remedy and to exhaust whatever remedy he chooses. When a federal employee obstructs the smooth functioning of a properly elected administrative process and abandons that process to pursue a remedy elsewhere, he fails to exhaust his chosen remedy and thereby forecloses judicial review." <span class="Italic">Vinieratos</span>, 939 F.2d at 772.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mixed case litigation can have interesting jurisdictional results. In <span class="Italic">Coons v. Sec'y of Treasury</span>, 383 F.3d 879 (9th Cir. 2004), the mixed case disposition by the Board included a finding against the plaintiff on a whistleblowing reprisal claim. The case moved on district court based on a disability discrimination claim (litigated along with civil service claims, including the whistleblower issue). On appeal the circuit court found against the plaintiff on the EEO issue, but determined that the Board did not properly analyze the whistleblowing claim, and that claim was remanded in <span class="Italic">Coons</span> to the Board for further adjudication.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 715 F.2d 1485, 1490-91 (Fed. Cir. 1983), confirmed that a mixed case of discrimination was beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Circuit. Congress intended to allow unitary rather than bifurcated review of an MSPB decision. There should not be a split of the case into two parts, one for a district court, the other for the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find anything in the Federal Courts Improvement Act or its legislative history which leads us to conclude that bifurcation of appeals is appropriate by virtue of the amendment of 7703(b) and the grant of "exclusive" jurisdiction to this court in 28 USC 1295(a)(9)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Policy considerations... support unitary appeal rather than bifurcated treatment. From the standpoint of judicial economy, consideration of all issues by a single tribunal is clearly preferable....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The above considerations which led to consolidation at the administrative level apply equally to an appeal. Merely because separate findings are made by the MSPB on each issue does not mean that the issues are logically severable in reaching a conclusion on the propriety of an employee's removal. In a district court suit, the employee will charge that discrimination motivated the adverse action and the Government defense inevitably must include the merits of the administrative action to justify the action taken and negate discrimination....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that where jurisdiction lies in the district court under 5 USC 7703(b)(2), the entire action falls within the jurisdiction of that court, and this court has no jurisdiction, under 5 USC 7703(b)(1), over such cases. This holding is limited to situations in which the employee is challenging judicially the board's determinations of both the discrimination and the nondiscrimination issues. We express no view on whether we would have jurisdiction over cases in which the employee initially raised both issues <span id="Page_5248"></span>before the board, but either abandoned the discrimination claim during the board proceeding or eschewed any judicial challenge of the board's ruling on that issue. Such a case is not before us. Petitioner here is actively pursuing review of all issues decided by the board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, Judge Nichols offered a concurring opinion, 715 F.2d at 1492-93:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Let's face it, in the eyes of Congress the district and regional circuit courts have expertise on everything under the sun, while we have expertise only on selected tiresome technical matters not involving gut issues such as discrimination. For this let us be grateful, as we have more than enough to do in the areas exclusively confided to us. If we yearn to participate in other litigation, we need only solicit assignments as visiting judges. As for the appellant, we may shed a tear for him as he joins the club, a large one, of those who have incurred the frustration, loss of time, and added cost, by mistaking their way in the complex maze of federal court jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I do not think the dissent is correct in fearing that the majority decision restores the nonuniformity of interpretation of United States Civil Service laws supposed to have obtained before the FCIA. It is obvious the Congress intended this Court to be, below the Supreme Court, the controlling authority on interpretations of the Civil Service laws. Such an intent can be effectuated although other sets of courts exercise concurrent jurisdiction, if one court will give proper deference to the decisions of another entitled to such deference.... &#8197;[T]he other federal courts should, and I expect will, give proper deference to ours when they adjudicate "mixed" cases. It may be the best solution would be to persuade Congress that we can be trusted not to commit mayhem upon the antidiscrimination laws, but this may be a long time coming, and meanwhile, the heavens will not fall.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> considered the majority's result destructive of Federal Circuit jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1497:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no doubt that a significant percentage of appeals from the MSPB involve allegations of discrimination. The majority's holding will strip this court of jurisdiction in those cases in which a discrimination claim is appealed to the district court. As a consequence, the district court will often be deciding issues of civil service law, with appellate review occurring in the regional courts of appeals. In many instances, the discrimination claim will be rejected and the district courts (and the regional courts of appeals) will have to decide purely nondiscrimination issues of the very type over which this court has been given exclusive jurisdiction. For all of these cases, the majority's decision will render Congress' grant of exclusive jurisdiction in this court a nullity. Through a feat of radical judicial surgery, the majority, in less than a year's time, has seriously circumvented this court's jurisdiction in contravention of the explicit intent of Congress and restores to the adjudication of civilian personnel cases the confusion the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 sought to avoid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilkes v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 225 Fed. Appx. 894, 895 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams</span> was applied by <span class="Italic">Meehan v. USPS</span>, 718 F.2d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Board affirmed dismissal of an employee who made vague references to discrimination in his petition for appeal, but offered no evidence on discrimination during the Board hearing. After he filed an appeal in court, the government sought dismissal, claiming that because discrimination was raised, the case should properly be heard by a district court. The Federal Circuit disagreed, first noting that in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> the employee had a suit pending in district court along with his Federal Circuit appeal, an impermissible splitting of a case. In <span class="Italic">Meehan</span>, no district court suit was pending. Second, the issue of discrimination was not properly stated in the appeals form and it was not actually litigated, because there was no substantive evidence produced on the subject during the hearing. Third, the case could not become "mixed," because the time for initiating district court action had expired and no issue of racial discrimination was raised on appeal. Since the case involved only nondiscrimination issues, it was exactly the type of case within the court's exclusive jurisdiction. The court summarized its holding on the issue: racial discrimination having not been put forth substantively as a basis for the adverse action, the appeal was not excluded from Federal Circuit jurisdiction as a case of discrimination subject to 5 USC 7702.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mere mention of discrimination as an affirmative defense before the Board does not alone divest the Federal Circuit of jurisdiction to review a final Board decision not addressing issues of discrimination because they were not actively pursued by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Rich v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3085), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address the issue of our jurisdiction. Before the Board and this court, Rice alleged that his removal was a result of "discrimination." This court has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal containing a nonfrivolous claim of discrimination incorporated within a petition to review an adverse action by an agency. The mere mention of discrimination in a petition for review, however, is not enough to oust our jurisdiction. We thus review Rice's discrimination claim only to determine if it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 796 F.2d 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that Rice offered no evidence to support his discrimination allegation. In his brief to this court, Rice similarly offers no argument as to why the Board erred in making this determination. Thus, Rice's reference to "discrimination" by the USPS cannot, without more, deprive this court of jurisdiction to entertain his petition for review.</p>

In addition, in her reply brief Ms. Miller stated unequivocally that she is waiving her discrimination claims in this action and that her claim pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission does not relate to her removal. We regard those statements as sufficient to constitute an express waiver of any discrimination claims relating to her removal action and thus sufficient to give this court jurisdiction over her petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Harris v.

[<span class="Italic">Kloeckner</span> and <span class="Italic">Perry</span> and subsequently discussed.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant does not waive EEO issues brought to the Board by filing an appeal with the Federal Circuit; only an express written statement waiving the claim of discrimination will be adequate. <span class="Italic">Davidson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, the Navy argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the sanctions order because it related to the removal appeal. The removal appeal involved both claims of discrimination and challenges to [an] appealable agency action (i.e., the removal itself). This court lacks jurisdiction over such "mixed cases" if the petitioner's allegations of discrimination are not waived and are non-frivolous. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Dep't of Air Force</span>, 796 F.2d 1469, 1470-71 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Because of this restriction on our jurisdiction, petitioners to this court are required to file a statement indicating whether discrimination issues persist in their cases. Fed. Cir. R. 15(c). The Rule 15(c) statement allows petitioners to avoid mixed-case jurisdictional issues by expressly waiving discrimination claims. Ms. Smets filed a Rule 15(c) statement, but instead of waiving her discrimination claims, Ms. Smets stated that "[n]o claim of discrimination by reason of race, sex, age, national origin, or handicapped condition has been or will be made in this case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Of course, the administrative judge's initial decisions make clear that Ms. Smets made allegations of discrimination, but in this case they do not defeat our jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While this court may not review the merits of discrimination claims in mixed cases, "we may perform such review as is necessary to determine whether a cognizable claim for discrimination has been presented." <span class="Italic">Dedrick v. Berry</span>, 573 F.3d 1278, 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The Board held that no evidence supported Ms. Smets' age and disability discrimination allegations, and Ms. Smets has not challenged that determination here. Bare allegations unsupported by evidence do not amount to a cognizable claim of discrimination that will deprive this court of jurisdiction. Therefore, this court will address the merits of the remaining issues in both appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant has not clearly waived discrimination issues, the Federal Circuit may dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Buenrostro v. DOJ</span>, 370 Fed. Appx. 115, 117 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Buenrostro alleges that discrimination was a basis for the agency's removal decision, and she has not waived this claim on appeal. On the statement concerning discrimination she filed pursuant to Federal Circuit Rule 15(c), she did not check the box which reads: "Any claim of discrimination by reason of race, sex, age, national origin, or handicapped condition raised before and decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board or arbitrator has been abandoned or will not be raised or continued in this or any other court." Instead, she checked the box which reads: "No claim of discrimination by reason of race, sex, age, national origin, or handicapped condition has been or will be made in this case." She also states in her reply brief that "this is not a discrimination case." These statements, however, are inconsistent with the petition for review she filed with this court, in which she confirms that she raised claims of discrimination based on gender, race, and reprisal before the board and argues that the board incorrectly denied each of them. Buenrostro has not waived her discrimination claim and is instead pursuing review of all the issues decided by the board, which requires that we dismiss her appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The courts are not anxious to split causes of action in federal employment cases. If an appeal is taken to the Federal Circuit, with an ostensible waiver of discrimination issues, litigation in district court on matters that preceded the Board appeal may be foreclosed as to issues brought before the Federal Circuit after that court decides the adverse action against the appellant, <span class="Italic">Chappell v.

Supp.2d 6, 7 (D.D.C. 1998) (holding that an employee who had raised mixed claims before the MSPB and then appealed to the Federal Circuit waived his discrimination claims when he checked the first box on the Statement Concerning Discrimination, stating that "[n]o claim of discrimination... has been or will be made in this case").[5]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Eighth Circuit has analogously found that, at the administrative level, an employee may waive discrimination claims by failing to include them in an MSPB appeal based on "similar issues arising out of overlapping facts." <span class="Italic">McAdams v. Reno,</span> 64 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (8th Cir. 1995). In <span class="Italic">McAdams,</span> a federal employee who was fired brought a sex discrimination action in district court and also appealed her demotion and termination to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1140-41. The district court dismissed her discrimination action, holding that the claims should have been included in her MSPB appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1141. On appeal, McAdams argued that the district court should have heard her discrimination claims because they were unrelated to the discrimination claims she had raised before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1142. The Eighth Circuit rejected this argument, finding that all of her discrimination claims were based on the same underlying facts.[6] The court held that by electing to proceed with an appeal to the MSPB, rather than the EEOC, the employee had to bring all of her mixed claims there in order to exhaust her administrative remedies and have the right to sue in district court. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Because she did not, her discrimination claims were "abandoned" and could not be brought in district court. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;"McAdams' demotion and removal appeals to the MSPB included allegations of sex discrimination and reprisal. She attached a copy of her EEO complaint to her demotion appeal. Her removal appeal also included attachments related to charges of discrimination. Moreover, her complaint in [the district court] action lists her demotion and removal as examples of the discriminatory actions taken against her." <span class="Italic">McAdams,</span> 64 F.3d at 1142.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this circuit we have not addressed this issue. However, we are persuaded by the Federal Circuit's interpretation of the governing statutory scheme, and agree that the language, legislative history, and underlying policies of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702 indicate that "Congress did not direct or contemplate bifurcated review of any mixed case." <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 715 F.2d at 1490. Because "the issues of a mixed case are tied together for resolution at the same time," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1489,[7] and because the Federal Circuit does not have jurisdiction over appeals of mixed cases, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 <span id="Page_5250"></span>U.S.C. 7703(b)(1), federal district court is the only forum in which a federal employee may seek judicial review of a mixed case after a final order from the MSPB. We are further persuaded by the D.C. Circuit and the Eighth Circuit that it necessarily follows from this statutory scheme that a federal employee who wants to preserve both discrimination and non-discrimination claims after a final order from the MSPB <span class="Italic">must</span> do so by bringing all his related claims in federal district court. Accordingly, an employee who chooses to appeal an adverse action to the Federal Circuit waives his right to pursue not only any discrimination claims he raised before the MSPB, but also any other discrimination claims arising out of the same facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We also agree that this holds true both in administrative proceedings and for the purposes of judicial review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1490.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the district court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider Chappell's discrimination and termination claims,[8] we conclude that Chappell waived his right to proceed on his discrimination action in district court when he elected to appeal his termination claim to the Federal Circuit, rather than bringing his related discrimination and termination claims in one forum, as required. First, although the MSPB order stated explicitly that Chappell could pursue both claims only in district court, Chappell decided to appeal to the Federal Circuit, where he could only appeal the termination decision. In addition, despite the suggestion of the district court, he chose not to file a motion for leave to amend his district court action to add an appeal of the MSPB decision. Similarly, when he attempted to appeal his termination claims to the Federal Circuit, he submitted, through his attorney, a form stating that he did not plan to pursue related discrimination claims elsewhere. His attempts to alter that form despite instructions to the contrary cannot be countenanced. <span class="Italic">See Otiji,</span> 47 F. Supp.2d at 7 ("To hold otherwise, especially where, as here, petitioner was represented by counsel, would be to encourage tactics 'designed to circumvent the Federal Circuit's effort to prevent litigants from seeking, in this area of review of government personnel decision, "two bites of the apple."'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> 846 F.2d at 1524). Thus, Chappell had ample notice of the consequences of filing his appeal in the Federal Circuit and numerous opportunities to avoid those consequences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Title VII gives the district court subject matter jurisdiction over federal employees' employment discrimination claims when administrative remedies have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c); <span class="Italic">Brown v. General Servs. Admin.,</span> 425 U.S. 820, 832-33, 96 S. Ct. 1961, 48 L. Ed.2d 402 (1976). The district court also has jurisdiction to review a final order of the MSPB in a mixed case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7702-7703. No statutory provision strips the district court of subject matter jurisdiction in a mixed case like Chappell's. Although the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction over all of Chappell's claims once the MSPB issued its final order, Chappell waived his right to file in that court by proceeding in the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This waiver applies even though Chappell contends he raised different discrimination claims before the MSPB and the district court. Chappell relies on an untenable distinction when he claims that he should be able to proceed with his discrimination claims in district court because the discrimination claims he brought before the MSPB were unrelated to those he brought in district court. As in <span class="Italic">McAdams,</span> Chappell's "various administrative filings raised related issues" and "arose out of overlapping facts." 64 F.3d at 1142-43. Before the MSPB, Chappell alleged that the DOL was acting out of discrimination and retaliation when it imposed the Performance Improvement Plan in January 2000. Before the district court, he raised claims referring to events ending in late 1999, including allegations that the DOL used unreasonable performance standards and failed to provide Chappell with the training and staff he needed to perform his job. All of these complaints related to Chappell's work environment and ability to do his job, including the conditions leading up to his termination. Indeed, Chappell's 2000 performance review and termination are more accurately seen as the culmination of his years of conflict with the DOL over his work conditions, rather than as entirely separate issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that all of Chappell's discrimination claims were related to his termination claims, and could have been brought before the MSPB as mixed claims. Because all of these claims could have been brought together, they should have been brought together--before the district court, if not before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Williams,</span> 715 F.2d at 1490 (citing with approval the description of adverse action claims and discrimination claims in mixed cases as "two sides of the same question [that] must be considered together"). Chappell's decision not to bring these claims together in district court when he had the opportunity to do so constitutes a waiver of the right to pursue his discrimination claims now. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the DOL is AFFIRMED.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit occasionally decides issues that seem to involve discrimination. The Federal Circuit reviewed a Board finding that termination did not result from an employee's alcoholism (allegedly causing AWOL leading to dismissal). <span class="Italic">Hertzog v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-889). But <span class="Italic">Hertzog</span> seems exceptional.

[Refer to <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> on discrimination.] According to the Board, the Federal Circuit can review Board decisions accepting settlements into the record that include resolution of EEO claims; the case is not then "mixed." <span class="Italic">Allen v.

The Federal Circuit's rule that essentially permits an appellant to waive an EEO claim before the Board that, if still maintained, would place the case at the door of a district court, was not addressed by the Supreme Court.
