<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-19"><span class="space">e.</span> Collateral Attack on Settlement Agreement, Waiver of Appeal Right</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Mention is made of the appellant who first initiates an appeal from an adverse action, settles it through some other form of action, e.g., retirement, and later appeals anew, stating that the retirement was coerced because of a problem involving the first action that was appealed and settled. The Board disallowed a collateral attack on the first settlement through a second appeal, <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 56 MSPR 69, 71-72 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleged that he had agreed to settle the demotion appeal and to resign only because the agency had threatened to cancel the demotion and to substitute a removal for cause. The appellant asserted that he feared losing retirement benefits if he were removed for cause, and that the agency's alleged threat to remove him therefore amounted to coercing him into resigning....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, his resignation was exacted by a baseless threat of removal. Whether or not he could have substantiated his allegations, though, the fact remains that the appellant agreed to retire in the course of settling his demotion appeal. The settlement agreement was found to have been voluntarily entered into, it was accepted into the record, and the demotion appeal was dismissed. The appellant did not file a petition for review of the initial decision dismissing the appeal, and the decision became final on January 24, 1992. Simply put, the appellant cannot prevail in an involuntary retirement appeal without convincing the Board that the initial decision and the settlement agreement in the demotion appeal should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, because the appellant agreed to retire in the course of settling the demotion appeal, he may not collaterally attack the validity of the agreement in a new action at the regional office level alleging involuntary retirement. Instead, any attack on the validity of the agreement must be made directly, through a petition for review of the initial decision in the demotion appeal.[1]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Should the appellant choose to now petition the Board for review...his petition should be accompanied by an affidavit explaining the circumstances surrounding the belated filing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 88 MSPR 370, 374 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span> for the proposition that "appellant cannot prevail in an involuntary retirement appeal, where the retirement results from a settlement, without convincing the Board that the initial decision and settlement should be set aside"); <span class="Italic">James v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 1, 3 (1994) ("Because the appellant agreed that...the agency could thereafter place him without the protection of grade and pay, he cannot collaterally attack the validity of the agreement in a new action at the regional office level alleging demotion."). [Refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-035.html#sec16-36">Setting Aside a Settlement</a>," for direct challenges to settlements of appeals within the Board's jurisdiction.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nease v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 365, 367 (1995), reiterated
<span class="Italic">Mahoney, involving</span> an involuntary retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant seeks to institute a new appeal claiming that her retirement was involuntary, such an appeal is barred as a matter of law. In <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. Department of Labor,</span> 56 MSPR 69 (1992), the parties settled the appellant's appeal from his demotion in an agreement which provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant would retire. The appellant retired pursuant to the agreement, and then filed a new appeal claiming that his retirement was involuntary. We held that the involuntary retirement appeal could not be considered because it amounted to an impermissible collateral attack on the validity of the settlement agreement in the demotion appeal, and that the appellant's only remedy was to attack the validity of the settlement agreement directly via a petition for review of the initial decision that dismissed the demotion appeal. Based on <span class="Italic">Mahoney,</span> we find that the appellant herein may not collaterally attack the settlement agreement in her removal appeal--that is, she cannot attempt to avoid her obligations thereunder--by filing a new action claiming that her retirement was involuntary. Instead, her only remedy is to attack the validity of the settlement agreement directly. Thus, the Clerk properly treated the appellant's submission as a petition for review of the initial decision that dismissed this appeal based on the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interpreting a settlement agreement through evaluation of parol evidence, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 502, 506 n.5, 2008 MSPB 83 (2008), noted of collateral attacks on settlements reached outside Board processes that impact Board appellate jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has no authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement reached in another forum, however. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Goodwin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 136, 139 n.2 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 983 F.2d 226 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Gorelick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 81, 85 (1990); <span class="Italic">Danelishen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 376, 379-80 (1990). Further, the Board generally will not entertain an appeal that amounts to a collateral attack on a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Nease v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 365, 367 (1995). If the appellant believes that the agency's decision to remove him is inconsistent with the settlement agreement, or that he should not be bound by the agreement, he should bring a direct proceeding to invalidate or enforce the agreement in the proper forum, namely, as set forth in the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a Board final decision approving a settlement leading to resignation is not challenged, the appellant may be precluded by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> [discussed in Chapter 4, "Previous Determinations of Disputed Facts, Issues, Claims: <a href="0100-2023-11-090.html#sec4-91"><span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span>, Collateral Estoppel, and Law of the Case--The Doctrines</a>"] from a collateral attack on the resignation in litigation over a retirement appeal, as the Federal Circuit explained, <span class="Italic">Bailey v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3206):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having entered into a settlement agreement under which she "voluntarily resign[ed]," Ms. Bailey cannot now challenge the voluntariness of her resignation. "[A] settlement agreement binds the parties who voluntarily enter into it," <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994), and the Board's previous finding that Ms. Bailey understood and "voluntarily" entered into the agreement is <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Having failed to appeal the Board's original determination that she entered into the agreement voluntarily, Ms. Bailey cannot now collaterally attack the agreement by claiming that her voluntary resignation pursuant to that agreement was in fact involuntary. <span class="Italic">Nease v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 365, 367 (1995); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. Department of Labor</span>, 56 MSPR 69, 72-73 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the settlement agreement provided that Ms. Bailey "agrees to waive any and all appeal rights with respect to the matters covered by this agreement." "Thus, even though she alleges that she resigned under duress, she is not entitled to appeal her resignation as involuntary because she waived her right of appeal." <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Department of Transp.</span>, 39 MSPR 538, 542 (1989); <span class="Italic">see also Clark v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 989 F. 2d 1164, 1169 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Accordingly, the AJ properly dismissed Ms. Bailey's involuntary resignation claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has jurisdiction to examine the allegation that a preappeal settlement agreement leading to resignation or downgrading should be given no effect because of improper agency action or lack of capacity of the appellant to enter into the agreement, <span class="Italic">Short v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 218-19 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee-initiated action, such as a resignation, is presumed to be voluntary unless the employee presents sufficient evidence to establish that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ward v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 60 MSPR 306, 308-09 (1994); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 59 MSPR 4, 7 (1993). An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal and is subject to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 51 MSPR 212, 214 (1991). The appellant's resignation was, however, a term of the pre-appeal settlement agreement. The Board has the authority to consider the validity of a pre-appeal settlement agreement, by which the appellant agreed to resign, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vasquez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 MSPR 128, 130-31 (1994); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 63 MSPR 649, 658-59 (1994). A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if the party believes that such agreement was unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 583 (1994). Further, where an appellant alleges emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board will consider: whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan v. VA</span>, 79 MSPR 81, 84-87 (1998), also noted the appellant's ability to challenge a preappeal (or unfiled) settlement agreement that resulted in his resignation, although the challenges to the settlement, or the resignation resulting from the settlement, were rejected:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board does not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement not entered into the record for enforcement purposes, it has the authority to consider the validity of such an agreement, including one, as here, entered into proceedings not before the Board, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board<span class="Italic">. See Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 582-83 (1994); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994). Accordingly, the administrative judge's finding to the contrary is error. Thus, we grant the appellant's PFR to <span id="Page_1913"></span>address his contentions that the settlement agreement and his ensuing resignation were involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal and is subject to the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Short v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 218 (1995)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Here, the appellant's December 31, 1996 resignation was a term of a November 12, 1996 pre-appeal EEO settlement agreement. The Board has the authority to consider the validity of a pre-appeal settlement agreement, by which the appellant agreed to resign, so as to determine its effect on a personnel action before the Board<span class="Italic">. See Short</span>, 66 MSPR at 218. A hearing is required with respect to jurisdictional questions only if the employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that, if proved, would establish Board jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1125 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed that his resignation was the result of duress because of the agency's action during the 120-day period leading to his resignation. Specifically, he alleged that in July 1996 he received a RIF notice and was forced to accept a Clerk/Typing position that he was unqualified for because of his visual impairment. He further claimed that after working in the Clerk/Typist position for 6 weeks, he received a second RIF notice rescinding the previous job offer based on his physical inability to perform the job and informing him that he would be separated on November 13, 1996<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In addition, the appellant submitted documents showing that he was in fact issued two RIF notices. It is well settled that the fact that an employee is confronted with the unpleasant choice of resigning or facing removal does not affect the voluntariness of the ultimate choice to resign<span class="Italic">. See Schultz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Absent a showing that the agency knew or believed that the termination could not be substantiated, or that an arguable basis for discharge did not exist, the fact that a decision to separate the appellant was issued does not render his subsequent resignation involuntary<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 363. Here, while the appellant claimed that the agency was manipulating the RIF process to get rid of him, he did not present sufficient evidence supporting such assertions for the Board to conclude that a jurisdictional hearing is necessary<span class="Italic">. See Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (although an appellant need not prove his entire case before he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, the Board may request sufficient evidence to determine if there is any support for what otherwise might be no more than bald allegations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed that his resignation was the result of duress in that he was suffering from work-related health problems and was given a 30-day medical leave. Where an appellant has alleged duress and emotional distress as a ground for involuntariness, the Board considers whether the appellant was represented below, whether he has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time, and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question or to assist his representative in the appeal<span class="Italic">. Wallace v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 50 MSPR 676, 678 (1991). The appellant was represented by an attorney during the negotiating and the signing of the settlement agreement. He submitted documentation that shows he was diagnosed with "fatigue, depression, back strain and neck strain related to having to use a monitor 8 hours a day despite severe visual loss, work related stress, headache, and genetic macular degeneration with the patient being legally blind." The appellant, however, never alleged that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his counsel. Accordingly, he has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the settlement and his resignation were involuntary because of his physical and mental conditions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Short</span>, 66 MSPR at 219-220 (employee who submitted an affidavit from a licensed social worker stating, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he was incapable of making a rational decision at the time of the signing of the agreement and claimed that the agreement was procured under time pressure made a nonfrivolous allegation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed that he was subjected to hostile behavior by agency management concerning his RIF and EEO concerns. To be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on these issues, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that his working conditions were made so intolerable by the alleged reprisal and retaliation as to render his resignation involuntary by reason of coercion<span class="Italic">. See Burke v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 434, 438 (1992). The only specific incident that the appellant claimed occurred was a meeting with the Director on July 11, 1996, wherein the Director allegedly chastised, threatened, and harassed him. Even if such a meeting occurred, it alone would not be enough to show that working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign<span class="Italic">. See Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 185, 190 (1992) (employee failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her resignation was involuntary when she failed to allege sufficient specific facts which, if true would show that she had no alternative to resignation), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325 (1994). Moreover, the meeting occurred 4 months before the appellant signed the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant claimed that the agency misled him about the benefits he would receive from the settlement agreement. The appellant claimed that "[t]he facility attorney, serving as proxy in this agreement, assured me that GS-11 status would apply to my remaining tenure and application for disability retirement." In order to show that his resignation was involuntary the appellant had to show not only that the agency representative's statement was misleading, but also that he reasonably relied on the statement to his detriment<span class="Italic">. Malan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 291 (1992). Pursuant to the November 12, 1996 settlement agreement, the agency agreed to pay the appellant a sum equal to the difference between his grade and pay (GS-10, Step 5) and the pay of a GS-11, Step 10 from August 31, 1993, until November 8, 1996, "without a corresponding personnel action." The agency also agreed to "[p]rovide a positive written employment reference mutually agreeable, based solely upon the performance as Public Affairs Specialist, GS-11/10, after the signing of this settlement agreement." Thus, the settlement agreement does not require the agency to promote him to a GS-11, Step 10 position. In light of the fact that the appellant was represented by counsel when he signed the agreement, we find that the appellant's assertions are not sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's alleged misrepresentations both misled him and that he reasonably relied upon them at the time he executed the settlement agreement and submitted his resignation. We therefore conclude, upon evaluating all of the appellant's assertions under the totality of the circumstance test, that his assent to the agreement and his resignation pursuant to it were voluntary<span class="Italic">. See Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 MSPR 513, 520 (1995), citing <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness that would entitle him to a jurisdictional hearing on this issue<span class="Italic">. See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994). Since the appellant voluntarily agreed to resign from his position, his appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction....</p>

VA</span>, AT-0752-13-0179-I-1 (NP 9/30/2013) (last chance agreement: "The Board has held that where, as here, an LCA was not reached during the course of a Board appeal, its validity may still be considered to determine its effect on the personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v.
