<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-19"><span class="space">1.</span> "Vitally Affects" Test; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Local 32</span> formulation led to many appeals and decisions attempting to define the permissible limits of indirect or direct impact of proposals on nonunit employees. In 1995 FLRA decided to recast and reexplain the "vitally affects" test in the context of a proposal that sought to define competitive areas by organization and regulated a condition of employment for supervisors and managers within those organizations. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 510 (1995), FLRA decided to cease considering a union's intent in formulating a proposal and look only to the result of that proposal. A proposal is nonnegotiable, not justified by the "vitally affects" test, when the proposal directly implicates working conditions of individuals outside the unit, supervisory personnel, and nonemployees. Inconsistent decisions were recognized but would no longer be followed. The 1995 decision is discussed later in this section. Before that decision there were other cases defining, interpreting, and applying the "vitally affects" test. They were not necessarily overruled by the 1995 decision. They are summarized in the discussion that follows. More recently FLRA reaffirmed that, as a matter of permissive bargaining, an "agency is fully empowered to bargain over, and to choose to agree to, a contract proposal that directly implicates the working conditions of its supervisors and managers," although "a union may not <span class="Italic">require</span> bargaining over permissive subjects and...an agency can withdraw from negotiations over permissive subjects at any time prior to reaching agreement." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3302 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 52 FLRA 677, 681-82 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit seized the opportunity to revise FLRA's application of the "vitally affects" test in <span class="Italic">Dept. Of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1436-43 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (referred to as the "<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>" decision), <span class="Italic">reviewing and remanding</span> <span class="Italic">IAM Local 2297 and Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, NC,</span> 38 FLRA 1451 (1991). In the context of the negotiability of promotion policies and allocation of parking, the court explained that the "vitally affects" test is not implicated in matters routinely considered to be within the ordinary scope of bargaining involving unit employees' working conditions. The court decided that the test is only implicated "when a union seeks to bargain over a matter that would <span id="page_520"></span>not normally be viewed as within the scope of mandatory bargaining," more particularly, when the bargaining proposal directly implicates the interests of nonbargaining unit personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first contested proposal seeks to compel the Navy to allow Local 2297 employees to compete for promotions at <span class="Italic">all</span> Cherry Point facilities; it would also allow all persons not in the Local 2297 unit to bid on positions throughout the Cherry Point installation. The second disputed proposal calls for the establishment of an "open" parking policy for <span class="Italic">all</span> employees and supervisory personnel working at the Cherry Point installation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In holding the two proposals to be within the Navy's duty to bargain under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ("FSLMRS"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101-7135 (1988), the Authority purported to apply a "vitally affects" test borrowed from private sector labor law. In so doing, the FLRA determined that the proposals were subject to mandatory bargaining, notwithstanding their impact on non-bargaining unit personnel, because they significantly and materially affected the conditions of employment of bargaining unit members. <span class="Italic">International Ass'n of Machinists &#x0026; Aerospace Workers Local Lodge 2297</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1451 (1991) ("<span class="Italic">IAM Local 2297</span>"). We agree with the Navy that the Authority's decision is infected with legal error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Authority's construction and application of the "vitally affects" test is inconsistent with the FSLMRS, the Authority's own precedents and the private sector labor law principles upon which the Authority purported to rely. We further hold that, under the FSLMRS, the union proposals at issue in this case cannot be found to be within the scope of mandatory bargaining to the extent that they seek to regulate the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and supervisory personnel. Accordingly, we vacate the Authority's order and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. <span class="Italic">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant petition--styled a "test case" by the Navy--presents for review the propriety of the Authority's adoption, construction and application of the "vitally affects" test. The Authority adopted the test as a result of a prior litigation that came before this court on three separate occasions. Indeed, to the extent that we find legal error in this case, we must shoulder at least partial responsibility for it: some of the Authority's missteps in this case have been prompted by prior directions from this court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Prior Litigation</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's adoption of a so-called "vitally affects" test had its genesis in two prior decisions of this court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32 v. FLRA</span>, 853 F.2d 986 (D.C. Cir. 1988) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>"); <span class="Italic">Local 32, AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 498 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>"). The issue in those cases was whether the Authority properly determined that union proposals defining the "competitive area" for reductions-in-force were not within the duty to bargain, on the ground that the proposals would affect non-bargaining unit employees. In <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, 774 F.2d at 502-04, we vacated the Authority's decision of non-negotiability, holding that the Authority had failed to explain its departure from prior precedent and had neglected to consider the "vitally affects" test applicable in private labor law....&#8197;On remand, the Authority applied a balancing test--weighing the unions' right to negotiate about the proposals against the agencies' right to set the terms of employment of non-bargaining unit employees--and, finding that the balance tipped in the agencies' favor, adhered to its prior decision. The affected unions again sought appellate review, and this court again vacated and remanded. We held that the Authority's balancing test was inconsistent with the FSLMRS, and we again suggested that the Authority consider adopting the "vitally affects" test. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, 853 F.2d at 991-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand a second time, the Authority heeded this court's suggestion and adopted a "vitally affects" test. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 F.L.R.A. 335 (1988) ("<span class="Italic">OPM</span>"). The Authority held that, after reconsidering the issue, it had decided to "adopt the private sector [vitally affects] test used by the NLRB." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 337. Translating the test into the framework of the FSLMRS, the Authority held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We will find that a proposal is within the duty to bargain under the Statute [FSLMRS] if it (1) vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees, and (2) is consistent with applicable law and regulations. We no longer will examine the effect of the proposal on non-unit employees or positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 338. The Authority went on to conclude that the competitive area proposal before it vitally affected the working conditions of bargaining unit employees and therefore was within the duty to bargain, notwithstanding the effect of the proposal on non-unit employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 338-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agencies affected by the <span class="Italic">OPM</span> decision petitioned for review, and the matter came before this court for the third time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OPM v. FLRA</span>, 905 F.2d 430 (D.C. Cir. 1990) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>"). The agencies argued on appeal that the Authority erred by adopting the "vitally affects" test and that it had applied the test incorrectly. We declined to reach the merits of these contentions because the agencies had not raised them before the Authority; accordingly, we enforced the Authority's bargaining orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. At 433-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>, the Authority has continued to apply and refine the "vitally affects" test--this case being only one of several examples. Because of the procedural posture in which <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span> reached this court, the instant petition represents the first time that the merits of the Authority's adoption and construction of the "vitally affects" test have come before this court for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Facts</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Navy refused to negotiate over the proposals, maintaining that both were outside the duty to bargain because they would regulate the conditions of employment of non-unit employees and supervisory personnel. In response, Local 2297 filed a complaint with the Authority, asserting that the Navy had violated its duty to bargain in good faith....&#8197;The Navy, in its submissions to the Authority, argued that the "vitally affects" test...should be reconsidered, that the Authority's construction of the test was flawed and that the subject matter of the two Local 2297 proposals was not sufficiently "vital" to Local 2297 employees to satisfy the test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Defining "vital" as "material or significant," the Authority concluded that Proposal One vitally affected bargaining unit members because it would improve appreciably their opportunities for promotion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1455. The Authority found that Proposal Two also would have a significant and material effect on the bargaining unit because it would bolster employee morale and reduce sick leave by enabling employees to walk shorter distances in inclement weather. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1461. Although recognizing that permitting negotiation on the proposals might restrict the ability of other bargaining units to negotiate about promotions and parking in the future, the Authority concluded that this circumstance went "not...to the negotiability of...[each] proposal, but to its merits." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Having found the "vitally affects" test satisfied, the Authority ordered the Navy to bargain with Local 2297 over both proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Navy now petitions for review of the Authority's decision. The Navy argues that the Authority erred in adopting a "vitally affects" test, that its construction of the test is inconsistent with the FSLMRS, and that it applied the test erroneously on the facts of this case. We find merit in the Navy's latter two contentions; therefore, we vacate the Authority's order and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DISCUSSION</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority's Adoption and Construction of a "Vitally Affects" Test</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that, in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>, this court encouraged the Authority to adopt a "vitally affects" test of the sort enunciated in <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, 404 U.S. at 178-79, 92 S. Ct. at 397. In attempting to follow the mandate of the court, however, the Authority has distorted the test beyond recognition. As a consequence of its flawed construction of the test, the Authority has defined the scope of mandatory bargaining under the FSLMRS in a manner that is at once underinclusive and overinclusive--underinclusive because it impermissibly restricts collective bargaining at its core, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, with respect to mandatory subjects of bargaining, and overinclusive because it simultaneously expands the duty to bargain to encompass subjects that are outside of the lawful reach of mandatory bargaining. The net result is that the Authority's definition of the scope of bargaining defies the legal limits set by the FSLMRS and the Authority's own precedents. Neither our prior coaxing of the Authority in the direction of the "vitally affects" test nor the deferential standard of review applicable in this case can justify such a result; therefore, we must vacate the Authority's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have no quarrel with the Authority's decision to <span class="Italic">adopt</span> the private sector "vitally affects" test. It is true, as the Navy points out, that the FSLMRS cannot be read "<span class="Italic">in pari materia</span>" with the NLRA. <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 2047, 109 L. Ed.2d 659 (1990). But it is also true that private labor law concepts may be used to <span class="Italic">inform</span> interpretation of the FSLMRS; indeed, we have so held on several occasions....&#8197;We find nothing in the FSLMRS to suggest that the "vitally affects" test--if properly construed--would be an inappropriate tool to use in defining the scope of mandatory bargaining under the Statute, and the Navy has supplied no convincing reason for thinking otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we approve the Authority's decision to adopt the "vitally affects" test, we agree with the Navy that the construction placed upon the test by the Authority is fatally flawed. Under the Authority's construction, the "vitally affects" test is triggered where a proposal regarding the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees "also <span class="Italic">affect[s]</span> employees or positions outside the unit." <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 33 FLRA at 337. Contrary to the Authority's assertion...this construction is <span class="Italic">not</span> consistent with the private sector "vitally affects" test; nor are the results it produces reconcilable with the FSLMRS or the Authority's own precedents.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_521"></span>Inherent in both the NLRA and the FSLMRS is a fundamental rule that the parties to a bargaining relationship are only <span class="Italic">required</span> to negotiate over "mandatory" subjects of bargaining. Mandatory subjects are those that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(d) (1988) (NLRA); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) (FSLMRS). The "vitally affects" test serves to define the limited circumstances in which subjects not normally seen to be within the compass of mandatory bargaining--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the terms of a relationship between the employer and a third party--may become mandatory subjects due to their effect on bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "vitally affects" test was first set forth by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>. There, the Court held that the scope of mandatory bargaining generally encompasses "only issues that settle an aspect of the relationship between the employer and employees." 404 U.S. at 178, 92 S. Ct. at 397. The Court noted, however, that although matters solely involving individuals outside the employment relationship normally do not fall within the compass of mandatory bargaining, "they are not wholly excluded." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A matter involving the employer's relationship with a third party may be subject to mandatory bargaining, the Court held, if such matter "vitally affects the 'terms and conditions' of...employment" of employees within the bargainning unit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 179, 92 S. Ct. at 398....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "vitally affects" test is <span class="Italic">not</span> implicated, however, merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit. As the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB</span>, 441 U.S. 488, 99 S. Ct. 1842, 60 L. Ed.2d 420 (1979), where a matter is an "aspect of the relationship" between the employer and the bargaining unit, such that "[n]o third-party interest is directly implicated,...the standard of <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span> has no application." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 501, 99 S. Ct. at 1851. Indeed, it is axiomatic that most demands asserted by unions have some impact on non-unit personnel; this fact in no way alters the employer's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects. The "vitally affects" test is relevant, then, <span class="Italic">only when a union seeks to bargain over a matter that would not normally be viewed as within the scope of mandatory bargaining...</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Authority construed the "vitally affects" test as being triggered when a "proposal concerning the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees...also <span class="Italic">affects employees or positions outside the bargaining unit.</span>" <span class="Italic">IAM Local 2297</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. at 1454 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, 33 F.L.R.A. at 338). This construction unduly restricts the duty to bargain under the FSLMRS--it forces a union to show that an otherwise bargainable proposal vitally affects bargaining unit members where the proposal, if adopted, might have <span class="Italic">some impact</span> on non-unit personnel. Such a rule is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span> and <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co</span>.; it likewise violates the Authority's own precedents by narrowing substantially the scope of mandatory bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 7 F.L.R.A. 275, 283-84 (1981) (proposal regarding procedure for filling vacancies in bargaining unit negotiable despite its effect on non-bargaining unit employees); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Service Employees' Int'l Union</span>, 9 F.L.R.A. 687, 688 (1982) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While unduly constricting the scope of mandatory bargaining in some respects, the Authority's construction of the "vitally affects" test unduly broadens it in others. The Authority's test, as applied, permits a union to seek to regulate, through collective bargaining, the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and management personnel (who are excluded by the FSLMRS from membership in any bargaining unit). Such a result is an incomprehensible application of the "vitally affects" test and, indeed, is flatly at odds with both the FSLMRS and the NLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) (agency obliged to bargain with exclusive representative of employees with respect to "conditions of employment <span class="Italic">affecting such employees</span>")....&#8197;As aptly expressed by Judge Friendly, "if a union insists on speaking on behalf of persons for whom it cannot properly so insist, an employer cannot be faulted for refusing to bargain." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Kelly Bros. Nurseries, Inc.</span>, 341 F.2d 433, 440 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Authority's construction of the "vitally affects" test is inconsistent with the FSLMRS, the private labor law principles upon which the Authority purports to rely and the Authority's past cases, it was legal error for the Authority to adopt the test as presently formulated. Therefore, the order at issue in this case, which was premised on the Authority's erroneous construction of the "vitally affects" test, must be vacated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposals at Issue</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having considered, and rejected, the Authority's formulation of the "vitally affects" test, we now turn to an examination of the two union proposals at issue in this case. The Navy argues that Local 2297's proposals are not within the duty to bargain because they seek to establish and regulate the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and supervisory personnel. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Union proposals that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit personnel are within the traditional scope of mandatory bargaining.&#x2003;As the Supreme Court made clear in <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co.</span>, 441 U.S. at 501, 99 S. Ct. at 1851, the "vitally affects" test has no application unless the interests of non-bargaining unit personnel are "directly implicated" by a union proposal--that is, unless the proposal purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of non-unit employees. Thus, absent a contrary government-wide regulation, a proposal by Local 2297 regarding the area of consideration for job openings <span class="Italic">within its bargaining unit</span> would be bargainable....&#8197;As the Navy conceded at oral argument, so too would be a proposal that <span class="Italic">all</span> parking at Cherry Point be reserved for employees in the Local 2297 unit."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Local 2297's proposals in this case go much further, however; they purport to regulate the conditions of employment, not only of bargaining unit employees, but of employees in other bargaining units and supervisory personnel as well. The union's first proposal, if adopted, would permit Local 2297 employees to compete for jobs in other bargaining units, without regard to any contractual restrictions imposed in contracts between the Navy and the unions representing employees in those other units. Local 2297's second proposal would set parking priorities for all persons at Cherry Point, including employees in other bargaining units and supervisory personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Local 2297's proposals directly implicate the interests of non-bargaining unit employees by purporting to regulate the conditions of their employment, the proposals fall outside the scope of mandatory bargaining <span class="Italic">unless</span> the "vitally affects" test is met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co.</span>, 441 U.S. at 501, 99 S. Ct. at 1851; <span class="Italic">United Technologies Corp.</span>, 274 NLRB 1069, 1070 (1985), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Pratt &#x0026; Whitney Air Craft Div.</span>, 789 F.2d 121 (2d Cir. 1986). To satisfy the test, the union must show that the "third party matter" about which it seeks to negotiate <span class="Italic">vitally affects</span> the conditions of employment of bargaining unit members. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, 404 U.S. at 179, 92 S. Ct. at 398; <span class="Italic">Sperry Sys. Management Div.</span>, 492 F.2d at 69-70.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are four possible "third party" groups about whose conditions of employment a union might seek to negotiate. These are: employees in other bargaining units; supervisory personnel; non-supervisory employees who are not in any bargaining unit; and non-employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not aware of any case--in either the public or private sectors--in which an employer has been required to bargain with a union over the conditions of employment of <span class="Italic">employees in another bargaining unit</span>, nor has the Authority cited to such a case....&#8197;There is a good reason why no such case appears to exist--for a court to so hold would violate the fundamental principle that a union is the exclusive representative of employees in the certified or recognized unit, and those employees <span class="Italic">only</span>....&#8197;It has never been thought that the policies underlying the "vitally affects" test are strong enough to overcome the far more fundamental principles involving the sanctity of certification/recognition and exclusive representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are likewise aware of no case in which a union has been permitted to bargain over the conditions of employment of excluded supervisory personnel.&#x2003;The absence of any such case is easily explained. Under the FSLMRS (and the NLRA), supervisors are members of management and are legally disabled from belonging to any bargaining unit, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7112(b)(1); as such, the same policies that prevent a union from purporting to regulate the conditions of employment of persons in other units apply with equal force to supervisory personnel....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to non-employees and employees who are not part of any bargaining unit, however, the calculus of negotiability is different. It is clear, of course, that a union may bargain with respect to non-employees if a non-employee matter vitally affects bargaining unit interests--that was the situation in <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 404 U.S. at 178-79, 92 S. Ct. at 397. It also may be that, under some circumstances, a union can bargain with respect to employees who are not members of any bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sperry Sys. Management Div.</span>, 492 F.2d at 68-70 (applying "vitally affects" test where union sought to regulate terms of employment of non-unit employees in separate plant); <span class="Italic">United Technologies Corp.</span>, 274 N.L.R.B. at 1070 (applying "vitally affects" test where union sought negotiation over hiring of temporary summer employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Local 2297 proposals seek to regulate the conditions of employment of members of other bargaining units and supervisory personnel. Such bargaining proposals are impermissible under the FSLMRS; accordingly, the Authority's bargaining order must be vacated. The only possibly unresolved issue is whether there are non-unit, non-supervisory employees at Cherry Point whose conditions of employment are directly implicated by the Local 2297 proposals. If there are such persons, the Authority can address on remand whether the "vitally affects" test is satisfied with respect to those persons on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we hold that the Authority's construction of the "vitally affects" test is fatally flawed and that the two proposals at issue in this case are non-negotiable to the extent that they purport to regulate the conditions of employment of supervisory personnel and employees in other bargaining units. This result is required by the terms and policies of <span id="page_522"></span>the FSLMRS; it is also consistent with the view of the scope of mandatory bargaining under the Statute taken by the Authority prior to the <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> litigation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One final point deserves mention.&#x2003;We reject the view, implicit in the Navy's argument in this case, that when a mandatory subject of bargaining (such as parking for bargaining unit employees) relates to a matter of concern to two or more different bargaining units, it is somehow transformed into a management prerogative. This view suffers from a flaw similar to that present in the Authority's construction of the "vitally affects" test--it excludes from bargaining certain clearly mandatory subjects. Under the Navy's view, a subject that concededly would be bargainable if only one bargaining unit were involved is rendered non-negotiable if two or more unions are on the affected premises; this would be an absurd result. It is true that it is sometimes inconvenient, even unseemly, to have two or more unions bargaining over all or a share of a finite benefit (such as parking spaces); but this is a problem inherent in the nature of collective bargaining. As the Navy's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, multi-unit (or "coordinated") bargaining may well be the appropriate solution on those rare occasions, such as this case, when more than one bargaining unit legitimately can claim bargaining rights over a particular subject. In the absence of such coordinated bargaining, however, each union may lay claim to a right to negotiate over matters within the compass of mandatory subjects of bargaining for employees within its designated bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">Faced with some abstruse decisions and occasionally inconsistent results, FLRA determined in 1995 to recast and reexplain the "vitally affects" test in the context of a proposal that sought to define competitive areas for purposes of reduction in force. The proposal created competitive areas by organization and directly regulated a condition of employment for supervisory and managerial personnel within those organizations. In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 497-513 (1995), FLRA decided to cease considering a union's intent in formulating a proposal and look only to the result of that proposal. FLRA abandoned the "vitally affects" test allowing negotiability of directly implicating working conditions of employees in other bargaining units, supervisory personnel, and nonemployees. The central holding of the case--if one can characterize the decision as presenting a central holding--appeared to be that when a proposal directly implicates employees in other bargaining units or supervisory personnel, the effect of the proposal on unit employees is not sufficient--even if it is "vital"--to bring the proposal within the duty to bargain; the vitally affects test then does not apply. Inconsistent decisions were recognized but would no longer be followed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents questions concerning the circumstances in which the duty to bargain set forth in section 7117 of the Statute extends to bargaining proposals directly implicating persons outside a union's bargaining unit. In particular, this case involves a bargaining proposal which concerns supervisors and managerial personnel, who are not in the Union's (or any) bargaining unit. Neither the questions nor the context in which they arise here is a matter of first impression for the Authority. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Health and Human Services, Region IV</span>, 11 FLRA 254 (1983). Unfortunately, as fully discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, previous decisions involving this issue have reached different conclusions, to some extent in response to appellate court rulings. Because such instability breeds protracted litigation rather than the resolution of disputes, we take this opportunity to review the relevant statutory provisions and precedent involving this issue, and to clarify the principles we apply in this and future cases.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We also take this opportunity to clarify our terminology. Bargaining proposals fall into three categories under the Statute: (1) subjects that are within the duty to bargain under section 7117 of the Statute (sometimes referred to as "mandatory" subjects of bargaining); (2) prohibited subjects of bargaining; and (3) subjects that are bargainable at the mutual election of the parties (sometimes referred to as "permissive" subjects of bargaining). Proposals in the first category have been described as "negotiable" by the Authority<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional Technical Engineers, Local 49 and U.S. Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 51 FLRA 3 (1995) (proposal requiring parties to use particular form to document certain agreements reached during negotiations held negotiable). Proposals in the last two categories generally have been described as "nonnegotiable" by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge 1-f and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Providence Medical Ctr.</span>, 51 FLRA 143, 143 (1995) (proposal affecting agency's right to determine internal security practices under section 7106(a) of the Statute held nonnegotiable); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 2145 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Hunter</span> <span class="Italic">Holmes McGuire Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia</span>, 48 FLRA 53, 59 (1993) (proposal concerning the numbers of employees assigned to a tour of duty, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1), held nonnegotiable). Such proposals are outside the duty to bargain under section 7117 because there is no statutory obligation to negotiate over them. In this and future decisions, we will use the language of the Statute, and describe bargaining proposals as either within or outside the duty to bargain under section 7117 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin our analysis with the wording of the Statute, which draws critical distinctions based on the status of employees who seek to exercise rights under the Statute or on whose behalf a labor organization seeks to exercise rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute provides rights, including the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment," to covered Federal "employees." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). The term "employee" is expressly defined to exclude supervisory and management personnel. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2). There is, therefore, no question that supervisory and management personnel are not granted bargaining or other rights under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is similarly clear that, with a "grandfathering" exception not relevant here, supervisors and managers may not be included in any bargaining unit found appropriate under the Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1). Further, a union is not entitled to bargain on behalf of employees other than those in the bargaining unit for which it is the exclusive representative. A review of relevant statutory provisions demonstrates this limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, the Statute establishes that a union's rights to bargain and to take other actions are confined to matters pertaining to the employees in its bargaining unit. Specifically, section 7114(a)(1) provides that a union "which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees <span class="Italic">in the unit</span> it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees <span class="Italic">in the unit</span>." (Emphases added.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other statutory provisions, when read together, also expressly link a union's bargaining rights, and conversely, an agency's obligations, to employees in the union's bargaining unit. Section 7114(a)(2) requires agencies and exclusive representatives to negotiate in good faith "for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." A "collective bargaining agreement" is defined, in section 7103(a)(8), as an agreement entered into as a result of "collective bargaining...." Finally, "collective bargaining" is defined in section 7103(a)(12) as the "mutual obligation of the representative of an agency and the exclusive representative of <span class="Italic">employees in an appropriate unit</span> to...bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment <span class="Italic">affecting such</span> <span class="Italic">employees</span>...."

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing statutory provisions, the Authority has held that a "matter proposed to be bargained is outside the duty to bargain if it does not concern conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">International Association of Manufacturers and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 and International Plate Printers, Die Stampers and Engravers Union of North America, Local Nos. 2, 24, and 32 and Graphic Communications International Union, Local No. 285 and International Association of Siderographers, Washington Association and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681 (1995) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing v. FLRA</span>, No. 95-1499 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 28, 1995) (citation omitted).[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;A bargaining proposal that concerns a condition of employment "must also satisfy other requirements to be negotiable under the Statute: for example, it may not be inconsistent with Federal law, including the Statute, and Government-wide regulations, or an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists." <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 50 FLRA at 681, n.7 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, the Authority has held that an agency has no duty to bargain with a union over matters relating to nonunit, supervisory positions because such matters do not concern conditions of employment affecting unit employees. For example, in <span class="Italic">National Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and U.S</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 3 FLRA 290 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>), the disputed proposal specified the procedures by which the agency would fill supervisory or management positions with unit employees. The Authority held the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The proposal puts conditions on filling supervisory and management positions which are outside the unit and may not be included in appropriate units by operation of section 7112(b)(1) of the Statute. An exclusive representative's obligation and correlative rights, however, extend only to employees in the unit....&#8197;Thus, as the proposal goes beyond the representation rights of the exclusive representative and does not directly relate to conditions of employment of unit employees, it is outside the duty to bargain under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 292 (footnote omitted).[16] The Authority's conclusion that bargaining was not required on the proposal is, in turn, consistent <span id="page_523"></span>with that reached by the Federal Labor Relations Council in construing analogous provisions of Executive Order 11491, as amended. <span class="Italic">See Texas ANG Council of Locals, AFGE and</span> <span class="Italic">State of Texas National Guard</span>, 4 FLRC 154, 157 (1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;The Authority did not address in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span> whether the disputed proposal could be bargained at the agency's election. However, in a decision issued shortly thereafter, also involving a proposal specifying procedures for filling nonunit positions, the Authority stated that "to the extent that the proposal would apply promotion procedures to nonbargaining unit supervisory positions it is negotiable only at the election of the agency." <span class="Italic">International Association of Fire Fighters, Local F-61 and Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 3 FLRA 438, 444-45 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Shipyard</span>). According to the Authority, "[w]hile an agency is not prohibited from bargaining on and, therefore, may, at its election, bargain on the promotion procedures for such nonbargaining unit supervisory positions, it is not obligated to do so<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 445. The Authority recently stated, in <span class="Italic">dicta</span>, that it would no longer follow <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Shipyard</span> and other decisions holding that an agency could elect to bargain over such matters. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2879, AFL-CIO and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, San Diego, California</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1088 n.6 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>). We note that, in <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, the Authority based its rejection of the <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span> line of cases on its interpretation of the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>. As neither party addresses this point, we leave for another day whether, <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> supports the dicta in <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Vitally Affects Test Exception</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has carved a narrow exception to this limitation on the duty to bargain under the Statute.&#x2003;Under this exception, an agency may be obligated to bargain with a union over matters that directly affect individuals other than unit employees insofar as such matters "vitally affect" the terms and conditions of employment of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1416-21 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Health Care Financing</span>) (proposal that equal employment opportunities be provided to prospective employees held within the duty to bargain because it vitally affected conditions of employment of unit employees and was not otherwise prohibited from bargaining). The "vitally affects" test, enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Allied</span> <span class="Italic">Chemical &#x0026; Alkali Workers of America, Local Union No. 1 v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. Chemical Division</span>, 404 U.S. 157 (1971) (<span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>), looks to the nature and extent of the impact on unit employees' working conditions of a bargaining proposal that directly implicates matters involving third parties. The Court stated that, in examining and assessing whether an employer is required to bargain over matters relating to third parties:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he question is not whether the third-party concern is antagonistic to or compatible with the interests of bargaining-unit employees, but whether it vitally affects the "terms and conditions" of their employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 179 (footnote omitted).[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, the union sought to bargain over proposals relating to insurance benefits for retired employees. Concluding that the benefits to current employees from bargaining over the proposals were "speculative and insubstantial at best[,]" the Court held that the employer was not obligated to bargain and, therefore, did not violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158, by refusing to do so. 404 U.S. at 180.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "vitally affects" test was adopted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> <span class="Italic">III</span> at the strong suggestion of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in two previous decisions involving the same parties and the same issue as the case now before us. <span class="Italic">See Local 32, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 498 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">OPM I), remanding American Federation of Government Employees, Local 32, AFL-CIO and Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management</span>, 14 FLRA 754 (1984) (<span class="Italic">AFGE I); OPM II, remanding</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>.[18] In adopting the vitally affects test, the Authority stated that it would find a proposal negotiable if it "(1) vitally affects the working conditions of unit employees, and (2) is consistent with applicable law and regulations." <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>, 33 FLRA at 338. Concluding that the Union's proposed competitive area satisfied both requirements, the Authority found it negotiable. On review, the D.C. Circuit enforced the Authority's decision. <span class="Italic">OPM III</span>, 905 F.2d at 435. The court refused to consider the petitioners' objection, raised for the first time on appeal to the court, "to the use of the private sector 'vitally affects' standard...<span class="Italic">." Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span> and <span class="Italic">II</span>, the Authority had determined that proposed competitive areas for RIF purposes were not within the duty to bargain under the Statute because the areas encompassed nonunit employees. In <span class="Italic">OPM I</span>, the court noted that the Authority's decision appeared "to be at odds with a familiar principle of private labor law, that a proposal concerning 'terms and conditions of employment' is within the employer's duty to bargain, despite its potential effects on third parties." 774 F.2d at 503. In <span class="Italic">OPM II</span>, 853 F.2d at 993, the court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[T]he Authority should reconsider the standard that obtains in the private sector. Under that standard, the expert adjudicator inquires only whether vital interests of unit employees would be affected by a given proposal, and permits bargaining over such proposals without regard to the potential effect on nonunit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>, the Authority applied the vitally affects test in a number of negotiability cases in which disputed proposals affected nonunit employees. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</span>, <span class="Italic">Local Lodge 2297 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina</span>, 38 FLRA 1451, 1454-56, 1460-62 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Naval Aviation</span>), <span class="Italic">remanded and vacated</span> <span class="Italic">sub nom. Cherry Point</span> (proposals concerning competitive areas for promotion purposes and parking). Some of these cases involved proposals concerning competitive areas for RIF purposes. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Marine Corps Locals (C-240) and Department of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 35 FLRA 1023, 1030-33 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the clear focus of the vitally affects test on unit employees, neither the effect on, nor the supervisory or other status of, the third parties was deemed relevant to these negotiability determinations. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation</span>, 38 FLRA at 1454 ("the proposal's effect on nonunit employees or positions is not a factor in making the negotiability determination"); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, 35 FLRA at 1032-33 ("The fact that some of these nonunit employees may be in bargaining units represented by other unions...does not affect our analysis of the proposal's effect on bargaining unit employees.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cherry Point and its Application by the</span> <span class="Italic">Authority</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review of <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation</span>, the D.C. Circuit "approve[d] the Authority's decision to adopt the 'vitally affects' test[.]" <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1439. However, in two respects, the court rejected the Authority's construction of the test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the court held that the vitally affects test is "not implicated...merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 1440 (emphasis in original). According to the court, the test "has no application unless the interests of non-bargaining unit personnel are 'directly implicated' by a union proposal...<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 1441. In the court's view, the Authority's statement of the test could unduly restrict the scope of mandatory bargaining under the Statute by requiring a proposal that otherwise fell within the duty to bargain to meet the additional requirement that it vitally affect unit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the court held that, in applying the vitally affects test to proposals that directly implicate third-party interests, it is necessary to distinguish among four "'third party' groups": (1) employees in other bargaining units; (2) supervisory personnel; (3) non-supervisory employees who are not represented; and (4) nonemployees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1442. According to the court, the test could not properly be applied to require bargaining over conditions of employment of the first two categories of employees: employees in other bargaining units and supervisory personnel. With respect to employees in other bargaining units, the court stated that the test could not overcome "the far more fundamental principles involving the sanctity of certification/recognition and exclusive representation<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. As for supervisory personnel, the court stated that, as supervisors "are members of management and are legally disabled from belonging to any bargaining unit...the same policies that prevent a union from purporting to regulate the conditions of employment of persons in other units apply with equal force to supervisory personnel." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>, 3 FLRA at 292).[20]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;We note that the court did not offer statutory support for the proposition that these fundamental principles and policies could be overcome with respect to the two remaining "third party groups." Like employees in other bargaining units and supervisors, a union is not expressly entitled under the Statute to bargain over either the working conditions of unrepresented employees or in any respect concerning nonemployees. Although the Authority has applied the Supreme Court's vitally affects exception to the mandatory scope of bargaining with respect to nonemployees, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems</span>, the Authority has not addressed the application of the test to unrepresented employees. <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Sperry Systems Management Division, Sperry Rand Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 492 F.2d 63 (2d Cir. 1974) (court concluded that union's attempt to bargain on <span id="page_524"></span>behalf of unrepresented employees constituted a refusal to bargain in good faith under the NLRA; court found no evidence that terms of employment of unrepresented employees affected those of unit employees). As the case now before us does not present this issue, we do not address it here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In effect, the court in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> held that the identity of the third party that is affected by a proposal <span class="Italic">is</span> relevant in determining whether the proposal is within the duty to bargain.[21] When a proposal directly implicates employees in other bargaining units and/or supervisory personnel, the effect of the proposal on unit employees is not sufficient--even if it is "vital"--to bring the proposal within the duty to bargain. In such circumstances, the vitally affects test does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;The court remanded the case to the Authority for further proceedings to determine whether there were "non-unit, non-supervisory employees...whose conditions of employment [were] directly implicated" by the proposals and, if there were, whether the vitally affects test had been satisfied<span class="Italic">. Cherry Point,</span> 952 F.2d at 1443. On remand, the Authority concluded that the record did not permit a construction of the disputed proposals as limited to non-unit, non-supervisory employees and, as such, the proposals were outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 2297 and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina</span>, 45 FLRA 1154 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority's Application of Cherry Point</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied the reasoning of the court in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> Point in a series of decisions concerning whether proposals that directly implicated individuals outside the union's bargaining unit are within the duty to bargain.[22] These decisions have involved three types of bargaining proposals: (1) those that directly implicated nonemployees; (2) those that directly implicated employees in other bargaining units; and (3) those that directly implicated supervisory personnel.[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;Consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, the Authority has found that the vitally affects test is not applicable to proposals that relate principally to unit employees' conditions of employment and do not directly implicate any category of individuals outside the union's bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1482 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 45 FLRA 1132, 1135-38 (1992) (proposal establishing procedure for selecting unit employees to serve as backups to supervisors).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;These categories encompass three of the four third-party groups discussed by the court in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>. As noted in n.19, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Authority has not addressed the application of the vitally affects test to proposals directly implicating unrepresented employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first category, the Authority has applied the vitally affects test in analyzing one proposal that directly implicated third parties who were not employees, the same category addressed by the Court in <span class="Italic">Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, under the vitally affects test. <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing</span>, 44 FLRA at 1416-17 (proposal that equal employment opportunities be provided to prospective employees). The proposal was found to be within the duty to bargain because it vitally affected unit employees' conditions of employment and was not otherwise prohibited from bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to proposals directly implicating employees in other bargaining units, the Authority has concluded that the vitally affects test does not apply and, accordingly, that such proposals are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 49 FLRA at 1089 (proposal establishing criteria by which employees in another bargaining unit would qualify for parking permits). In one of these decisions, <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 47 FLRA at 1089, the Authority found a proposed competitive area for RIF purposes outside the duty to bargain insofar as it encompassed employees in other bargaining units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to proposals directly implicating supervisory personnel, the Authority similarly has held, with one exception, that the vitally affects test does not apply and, accordingly, that such proposals are outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing</span>, 44 FLRA at 1422-24 (proposal that managers and supervisors be held accountable for successful implementation of affirmative employment program). The exception is <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, the decision relied on by the Union in this case. <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> is the only post-<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> case in which the Authority found a proposal that directly implicated supervisory employees to be within the scope of mandatory bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal at issue in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, like the proposal here, concerned competitive areas for RIF purposes. The Authority concluded that, although the proposed competitive area encompassed, and thereby directly determined the conditions of employment of, supervisors, it was within the duty to bargain consistent with the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>. <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 29. According to the Authority:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he fact that the competitive areas defined by the provision...encompass management personnel as well as bargaining unit employees does not indicate that the Union is seeking to regulate the conditions of employment of the management personnel. Rather, it represents an effort to draft a proposal directly affecting the competitive areas of bargaining unit employees that meets the regulatory requirements governing the definition of competitive areas. Therefore,...the Union does not, through the provision...purport or seek to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of management personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 28.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review, the D.C. Circuit concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the agency's argument that the proposal should have been found nonnegotiable based on its effect on supervisors and managers because that argument had not been made to the Authority and, instead, had been raised for the first time before the court. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 7 F.3d at 246. In particular, the court rejected the agency's assertion that it would have been futile for it to make the argument to the Authority in a request for reconsideration of the <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> decision. In the court's view:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Authority's reasons for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> seem to us rather tenuous. We therefore suspect that if the government had provided the FLRA the cogent arguments presented to this court, the FLRA may well have reconsidered its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 7 F.3d at 245-46.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">IFPTE</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>, 47 FLRA 1086, the Authority considered a union proposal that the competitive area for RIF purposes "shall be all commands at Mare Island represented by" a particular local of the union. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1087. The Authority noted that the union held exclusive recognition in three organizational entities at Mare Island, and that there were other bargaining units, represented by other unions, also located there.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found that the meaning of the proposal was unclear.&#x2003;In particular, the Authority concluded "that the plain wording of the proposal, and the [u]nion's somewhat inconsistent statements of intent, supported two different interpretations of the proposal<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. At 1088. In this regard, the Authority did not consider, as it had done in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, whether the union sought to accomplish anything different from what the proposal would in fact accomplish. Instead, the Authority analyzed the proposal under the two possible interpretations of what the proposal would accomplish. The Authority found that under the first (whereby the proposed competitive area included only unit employees), it was inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402, and under the second (whereby the competitive area included employees represented by other unions), it was outside the duty to bargain consistent with the analysis in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Statute and Precedent in This</span> <span class="Italic">Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, a proposal creating a competitive area that includes supervisory employees may be within the duty to bargain if it can be established that the union "does not...purport or seek to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of management personnel." <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, 44 FLRA at 28. Because this conclusion departs from the weight of other Authority precedent in the aftermath of <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, and in view of the observation of the court in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> that the Authority's reasons for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> were "tenuous," 7 F.3d at 245-46, we find it appropriate to reconsider the Authority's decision. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the analysis the Authority articulated in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> is without support in the Statute or relevant case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find no statutory basis for the proposition that, in determining whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment of unit employees, it is appropriate to rely on what the union seeks to accomplish rather than what the proposal would, in fact, accomplish, when the two are inconsistent. The legislative history of the Statute likewise produces no support for discounting the effect of a proposal in this way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, to the extent that such a departure in <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> was premised on either the application of the vitally affects test in the private sector, or the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, we conclude that it was not well-founded.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the private sector application of the vitally affects test, it is clear that this exception to the traditional scope of bargaining is narrow. <span class="Italic">See Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1440. We have found no cases supporting application of this doctrine, or any other private-sector precedent, to determine that a proposal is within the duty to bargain based on what motivated a union's proposal, rather than what the proposal would do. <span id="page_525"></span><span class="Italic">Cf. Pittsburgh Plate Glass</span>, 404 U.S. at 179 ("question is...whether the third-party concern...vitally affects the 'terms and conditions" [sic] of...employment.") (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the approach articulated by the Authority in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> was not followed in the subsequent case that raised similar issues: <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span>. The Union attempts in this case to distinguish its proposal from <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span> on the basis that its proposed competitive areas would not encompass employees in any other bargaining units. However, under the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, regulation of working conditions of employees in other bargaining units is proscribed to the same extent as supervisory employees. If "intent" in the manner used by the Authority in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> is a relevant concept, it is relevant to the same extent in both situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unable to reconcile the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">IFPTE</span> and <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>. In view of the absence of any grounding in either the Statute or private sector labor law, and the weight of Authority precedent that <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Weather Service</span> counters, we conclude that the approach it adopted should no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arguments in this case do not persuade us that the Union's proposal, which directly determines the working conditions of supervisory personnel, is within the duty to bargain. We recognize that this conclusion places the Union in a "catch-22" situation--because the inclusion of supervisors in the proposed competitive area is, as the Union states, the "unavoidable" result of complying with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.402. We also are mindful that two Authority decisions finding proposed competitive areas that encompassed supervisory employees to be within the mandatory scope of bargaining, <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span> and <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>, have been enforced by the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Commerce; OPM III</span>. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">OPM I</span> and <span class="Italic">II</span> "pushed the FLRA into exactly the position it...adopted" in <span class="Italic">AFGE III</span>. <span class="Italic">OPM III</span>, 905 F.2d at 435 (Silberman, J., concurring). Given this, and the evident significance of competitive areas to the working conditions of employees, <span class="Italic">see AFGE II</span>, 33 FLRA at 339, we do not reach our decision lightly. However, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the Agency is not required to bargain over the proposal, and we dismiss the Union's petition for review.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span> [<span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>], issued during the pendency of this appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit examined the Authority's application of the vitally affects test. The court approved the Authority's adoption of the private sector test but determined that the Authority had misapplied it in various circumstances. Specifically, the court found that the Authority had incorrectly utilized the vitally affects test to examine proposals that affect employees or positions outside the bargaining unit. In the court's view, the vitally affects test is appropriately used "to define the limited circumstances in which subjects not normally seen to be within the compass of mandatory bargaining--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the terms of a relationship between the employer and a third party--may become mandatory subjects due to their effect on bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span>, slip op. at 10. The court added that the test "is <span class="Italic">not</span> implicated, however, merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit."...&#8197;The court recognized that most union bargaining demands would have some "extra-unit effects" on non-unit personnel but held that such effects would not alter an employer's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of particular significance to the disposition of the proposals at issue here is the court's finding that "proposals that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit personnel are within the traditional scope of mandatory bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 13. As to such proposals, there is no need to apply a vitally affects test. The court cited <span class="Italic">Ford Motor</span> Co. for the proposition that the vitally affects test is not applicable unless the interests of non-bargaining unit personnel are "'directly implicated'" by a union proposal or, phrased alternatively, when a proposal "purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of non-unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In such circumstances, the proposals would fall outside the mandatory scope of bargaining absent a showing that the proposals vitally affected conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. The court reached the same conclusion as to proposals that purport to regulate the working conditions of non-employees, finding that a union may bargain over "a non-employee matter [that] vitally affects bargaining unit interests...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, of importance here is the court's discussion of proposals that involve mandatory subjects of bargaining but concern two or more different bargaining units. The court rejected the view that such proposals would be nonnegotiable simply because they relate to matters of concern of more than one bargaining unit. The court found that such a holding would be "an absurd result[&#8197;]" because it would unduly narrow the scope of bargaining over mandatory subjects....&#8197;Instead, the court held that where a matter concerns a mandatory subject of bargaining affecting more than one bargaining unit, each union may seek to negotiate with respect to the matter for employees within its designated unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is clear that these proposals pertain to the establishment of a cafeteria and the provision and quality of food services at the employees' place of work. Consequently, as discussed in more depth below, we find, consistent with clear Authority precedent, that these proposals concern the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems Command</span>. Additionally, based on the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span>, we conclude that because these are proposals that principally relate to the conditions of employment of bargaining unit personnel, the vitally affects test is not relevant to a determination of their negotiability....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot</span>, the court referenced and relied on <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co</span>. to establish the proposition that a vitally affects test need not be applied when matters involve the relationship between an employer and a bargaining unit and directly implicate no third-party interests. Significantly, <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co</span>. involved union bargaining demands over cafeteria and vending machine prices and services. In that decision, the Supreme Court rejected an argument that in-plant food prices and service were too trivial to constitute mandatory subjects of bargaining. Instead, the Court reached the conclusion that "the availability of food during working hours and the conditions under which it is to be consumed are matters of deep concern to workers, and one need not strain to consider them to be among those 'conditions' of employment that should be subject to the mutual duty to bargain." 441 U.S. at 498.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Consistent with prior Authority decisions and <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co</span>., we reaffirm the view that, as a general proposition, matters pertaining to the availability and provision of food services for bargaining unit employees are within the mandatory scope of bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent">For routine bargaining proposals, analysis had shifted from "directly affects" or "directly concerns" to "vitally affects" to "matters involving the relationship between an employer and a bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> was once more summarized in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1920 and DOD, AAFES, Ft. Hood Exch.</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 345-46 (1993), concerning a bargaining demand (Proposal 2), for relocation of certain employees to make room for other employees who were being moved into an installation. FLRA explained as to the impact of the proposal on nonunit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is nonnegotiable because of its effects on personnel outside the unit.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, North Carolina v. F.L.R.A.</span>, 952 F.2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit approved the Authority's adoption of the vitally affects test used in the private sector "to define the limited circumstances in which subjects not normally seen to be within the compass of mandatory bargaining--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, the terms of a relationship between the employer and a third party--may become mandatory subjects due to their effect on bargaining unit employees." 952 F.2d at 1440. The court also stated that the test "is <span class="Italic">not</span> implicated, however, merely because a union proposal, which is otherwise within the scope of mandatory bargaining, would, if accepted, have <span class="Italic">some</span> <span class="Italic">impact</span> on persons outside the bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original). According to the court, the vitally affects test applies only when the interests of nonunit personnel are "directly implicated" by a proposal--when a proposal "purports to regulate the terms and conditions of employment of non[&#8197;]unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 1441....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court recognized that most union bargaining demands would have some "extra-unit effects" on nonunit personnel but held that such effects would not alter an employer's duty to bargain over mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, 952 F.2d at 1440 n.6. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Underwater Systems Center</span>, 43 FLRA at 1343; <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association and Antilles Consolidated School System</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 237 (1986) (the Authority stated that "a proposal which is principally focused on bargaining unit positions or employees and which is otherwise consistent with applicable laws and regulations is not rendered nonnegotiable merely because it also would have some impact on employees outside the bargaining unit").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record demonstrates that some of the accounting office employees at the main exchange store who are covered by Proposal 2 are unit <span id="page_526"></span>employees.&#x2003;The Agency does not dispute the fact that the relocation of those employees to the administrative office in order to make room for the Dishonored Check Office employees at the main exchange store is a matter pertaining to the conditions of employment of unit employees both in the accounting office and the Dishonored Check office. We find, therefore, that Proposal 2 principally relates to the conditions of employment of unit employees rather than purporting to regulate the conditions of employment of accounting office employees who are not in the unit. Consequently, consistent with the principles stated in <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>, because Proposal 2 concerns the conditions of employment of unit employees, we find that: (1) the vitally affects test is not implicated; and (2) the fact that the relocation of unit employees required by the proposal may also involve the relocation of nonunit employees does not render the proposal nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">The vitally affects test was considered in a 2011 FLRA decision. If the union seeks to demonstrate that a proposal involving the conditions of personnel outside the unit meets the "vitally affects" test, the union must invoke application of the test and articulate that application in its negotiability appeal, as was explained in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R-109 and VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys., Newington</span>, 66 FLRA 278, 279-80 (2011), involving a proposal to limit the ability of VA Compensated Work Therapy patients to operate certain equipment at a hospital out of concerns for the safety of unit personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the proposal is non-negotiable because it would require the Agency to bargain over the duties and conditions of employment of non-employees, i.e., CWT patients. The Union agrees that CWT patients are not employees, but avers that the proposals are intended to address safety issues for bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly determines the conditions of employment of non-employees is outside the duty to bargain unless the proposal addresses matters that "vitally affect" conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 32</span>, 51 FLRA 491, 502 (1995) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32</span>) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C. v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32 v. FLRA</span>, 110 F.3d 810, 813 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Proposal 1 directly determines the conditions of employment of non-employees by prohibiting the Agency from assigning them certain responsibilities. The Union asserts that the proposal "seek[s] to protect employee safety." However, the Union has not asserted that this proposal "vitally affects" bargaining unit employees, which is required when a proposal concerns non-employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 32, </span>51 FLRA at 502.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2424.32(a) of the Authority's Regulations, the Union has the burden of "raising and supporting arguments that the proposal...is within the duty to bargain." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(a); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(a) (stating that purpose of a union's response to an agency SOP "is to inform the Authority and the agency why, despite the agency's arguments in its [SOP], the proposal...is within the duty to bargain"). In the absence of any arguments that the proposal vitally affects the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, the Union has failed to meet its burden of establishing that the proposal is within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 1547, </span>65 FLRA 911, 913 (2011) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1547</span>) (Member Beck dissenting, in part, as to other matters) (relying on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(b), Authority dismissed agency's claim that proposal was contrary to law because agency failed to provide any support for this claim). Consequently, we dismiss the Union's petition as to Proposal 1. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent">Where does this leave us? Perhaps a section of the 2013 FLRA's Negotiability Guide offers succor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether a proposal involves a condition of employment of bargaining-unit employees, the Authority considers two basic factors: (1) whether the matter pertains to bargaining-unit employees; and (2) whether there is a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of those employees.[265] As to the first factor, as discussed further below, a proposal that focuses principally on non-bargaining-unit positions or employees does not directly affect bargaining-unit employees' work situations or employment relationships.[266] As to the second factor, the record must establish a direct connection between the proposal and the bargaining-unit employees' work situations or employment relationships.[267] For example, the Authority found that a proposal concerning the off-duty activities of employees did not concern bargaining-unit employees' work situations or employment relationships.[268]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Authority and judicial precedent differentiate among proposals concerning the working conditions of four groups of non-unit individuals: (1) employees in other bargaining units; (2) supervisory personnel; (3) non-supervisory employees not in any bargaining unit; and (4) non-employees.[269]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[269]<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Cherry Point, N.C. v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1442 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Cherry Point); AFGE, Local 2879, AFL-CIO</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1087 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 2879</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1416-17 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Local 1923</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the first group, a proposal that <span class="Italic">directly determines</span> conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units is outside the duty to bargain.[270] This is because permitting an agency to negotiate with one union over the conditions of employment for employees represented by another union would violate "the principle of exclusive representation."[271] For example, the Authority has held that a union's proposal requiring an agency to assign employees from a unit represented by another union to a particular facility was outside the duty to bargain.[272] But proposals that only indirectly affect the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units are not outside the duty to bargain solely because they affect those employees.[273]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[271]<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 1052, 1054 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Newport News</span>).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the second group, proposals that directly determine the conditions of employment of supervisors are outside the duty to bargain.[274] However, as stated in section 1.7 of this Guide, matters pertaining to managers' and supervisors' conditions of employment are permissive subjects of bargaining.[275] Thus, an agency may bargain over, and agree to, contract proposals that directly implicate its supervisors' and managers' working conditions.[276] As with other permissive subjects, if an agency and a union reach such an agreement, and the agreement is otherwise consistent with law, then the agency head cannot disapprove it,[277] and it is enforceable in arbitration.[278] And proposals that relate principally to unit employees' conditions of employment are not removed from the mandatory scope of bargaining simply because they indirectly affect supervisors.[279]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As to the third and fourth groups, a proposal that directly affects the conditions of employment of either non-employees or employees who are not in any bargaining unit is outside the duty to bargain unless the proposal addresses matters that "vitally affect" bargaining-unit employees' conditions of employment.[280] "In determining whether or not a proposal vitally affects bargaining[-]unit employees, the Authority looks to whether 'the effect of that proposal upon unit employees' conditions of employment is significant and material, as opposed to indirect or incidental.'"[281] For example, the Authority has held that a proposal prohibiting discrimination in the hiring process--which would directly affect non-employee applicants--was within the duty to bargain because it "relate[d] to unit employees' significant and material interest in eliminating discrimination in the unit," and, thus "vitally affect[ed] the conditions of employment of unit employees."[282]</p>

<p class="noindent">However the "vitally affects" test is formulated, a proposal having the effect of regulating only the working conditions of employees outside the unit is not likely to survive a negotiability challenge. In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-100 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Branch Exch. Store</span>, 46 FLRA 520, 520-21 (1992), the proposal was <span id="page_527"></span>to extend certain base shopping privileges to individuals outside the unit. Employees within the unit already had the privileges. Rather than rejecting the proposal because it dealt exclusively with nonunit employees, FLRA selected a narrower ground: the proposal was nonnegotiable because it encompassed supervisors and other employees who could not, under the Statute, be represented by the union. FLRA essentially followed the <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span> analysis that the "vitally affects" test does not apply when a union seeks to regulate the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units or management and supervisory personnel.</p>
