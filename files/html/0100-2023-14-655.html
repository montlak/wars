<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-656"><span class="space">1.</span> Performance Measurement; Statistical Applications; Forced Distributions</h4>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal required the employer and union to negotiate on how work assigned to employees would be counted for the purpose of measuring the work output against performance standards. The proposal did not interfere with the agency's right to assign work or to set or adjust performance standards in relation to the work output. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 7 FLRA 235, 238-39 (1981) (Proposals 1-5); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 36 FLRA 606, 612 (1990) ("Proposals that require an agency to count a particular action in addition to the actions already being counted under a performance standard and that preserve the agency's discretion to adjust the performance standard to accommodate the additional action being counted, do not directly interfere with management's right...to determine the content of performance standards, but constitute negotiable procedures"). A proposal that established a procedure for counting work performed by employees in a manner the union felt would equitably reflect the work performed was negotiable. The agency had the discretion to assign work, to direct employees, and to adjust its performance standards to accommodate the manner of counting the work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 168, 174-75 (1986) (Proposal 7).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal subject to bargaining required independent corroboration of performance data generated by a statistically-based work measurement program. The proposal was a procedural aspect of performance evaluation subject to bargaining. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 8 FLRA 30, 31 (1982). A set of broader statistical proposals was approved for bargaining in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Vallejo Dist. Office</span>, 35 FLRA 1276, 1283-84 (1990): Proposal 4, that "[s]tatistical data [that may be used] will be compiled using commonly accepted <span id="page_1098"></span>statistical techniques recognized as valid by the statistical community"; and Proposal 5, "[c]onclusions based on statistical data will be based on techniques commonly accepted and recognized as valid in the statistical community." The proposals were properly directed "at assuring management's selected measurement techniques are valid and objective," making them negotiable procedures. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-650.html#sec6-651">Studies, Observations, and Sampling</a>."] On the subject of statistics, FLRA approved negotiability of Proposal 3 in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1974 and VA Reg'l Office, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA 1170, 1175 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where quality is expressed in the standard as a percentage error rate or percentage error free rate, valid statistical methods shall be used to determine if the true error rate is within the stated standard. A three standard deviation table shall be employed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1974</span>, 46 FLRA at 1176-77:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the outset, we reject the Agency's claim that the Union has not met its burden of explaining the "complicated statistical concept" of a three standard deviation table. Both parties have submitted sufficient information concerning three standard deviation tables to enable us to reach a negotiability determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that for certain positions, the proposal would require the Agency to change from an error rate based on a 100 percent work review to a percentage error rate based on a sample. The proposal applies, by its terms, to those performance standards "[w]here quality is expressed as a percentage error rate" and is intended, according to the Union, to ensure that an error rate determined from a sample of an employee's work accurately reflects the error rate of the employee's work as a whole. As the Union's statement is consistent with the plain wording of the proposal, we adopt it for the purposes of this decision and conclude that the proposal applies only in situations where less than 100 percent of an employee's work is reviewed. Indeed, the Agency acknowledges that a three standard deviation table has no application in situations where a "true error rate" is determined from a 100 percent review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 requires the Agency to use "valid statistical methods" and a specified standard deviation table to determine an employee's error rate in those circumstances where the standards express the error rate as a percentage and where only a sample of an employee's work is reviewed. The proposal would not limit management's choice of sampling as a means of reviewing employees work and would not in any manner affect management's discretion to establish or change the error-free rate of its standards. Rather, Proposal 3 would simply assure that an employee's error rate is accurately determined when only a portion of an employee's full output is selected for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 3 concerns only the evaluative methodology used to measure error rate.&#x2003;The Authority has held that proposals concerning the methodology used in measuring the quantity or quality of employees' work are negotiable procedures under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 36 FLRA 606, 612 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>); <span class="Italic">SSA, Vallejo</span>, 35 FLRA at 1284; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1760, AFL-CIO and Department of Health and Human Service, Social Security Administration</span>, 23 FLRA 168, 174-75 (1986) (<span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the proposal would not change the number of allowable errors per employee, as claimed by the Agency. Rather, as discussed earlier, the proposal applies only to those situations where management's standards are expressed as a percentage error rate. Proposal 3 would not change that percentage. Instead, it merely would require the Agency to measure the employee's errors with greater statistical certainty. Consequently, we find that Proposal 3 preserves the Agency's discretion to establish its performance standards and to determine its evaluative methodology. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 3 is a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Also negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1974 and VA Reg'l Office, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA 1170, 1177 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 33 F.3d 1391, 1393-95 (D.C. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>, was Proposal 4, establishing a means to validate sampling techniques:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where quality is expressed in terms of a number of allowable errors, the sample size shall be the same for each employee performing like duties. If an expanded sample is reviewed for an employee, valid statistical methods shall be employed to determine if the true error rate is within the error rate expressed in the standard for the sample size in the normal review. A three standard deviation table shall be employed.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained, 46 FLRA at 1178-79:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially...we reject the Agency's claim that the Union has not met its burden of explaining the use of a three standard deviation table. We also reject the Agency's claim that the first sentence of the proposal interferes with the Agency's right to determine its mission by requiring the Agency to conduct an expanded review of work for every employee performing like duties if the Agency decides to conduct an expanded review for any employee. In our view, nothing in the plain reading of the first sentence of the proposal concerns expanded size samples. Moreover, the second sentence, which establishes the performance evaluation methodology to be used when a work sample size is expanded, expressly refers to expanding the sample size for "an employee[.]" In other words, although the first sentence of the proposal requires the Agency to use the same sample size for employees performing like duties, the balance of the proposal clearly contemplates that there will be circumstances in which an expanded work sample size will be utilized for a particular employee. Consequently, we find no support for the Agency's claim that the first sentence interferes with the Agency's ability to determine its mission.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find no support for the Agency's arguments that the proposal would require management to establish a percentage error rate and, by using a statistically predictive model, to allow a greater number of errors than permitted under the standards. Nothing in Proposal 4 requires a percentage error rate. In addition, nothing in the proposal indicates that a greater number of errors would be allowed than the standards permit. Instead, the proposal requires only that the number of errors allowed for an expanded sample be "within" the allowable numerical error rate which the standards prescribe for a normal sample. As the standards are expressed in terms of normal size samples, the proposal requires that valid statistical methods, including the use of a three standard deviation table, be used to determine the standard's error rate for expanded size samples.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 4 provides only that the Agency ensure the accuracy and validity of its selected evaluation methodology when it reviews an expanded sample of an employee's work under its standards. Management remains free to determine the size of the expanded or unexpended sample and to determine the error rate permitted by its quality standards. We conclude that Proposal 4 fully preserves the Agency's discretion to determine or alter its performance standards. Accordingly, we find that as Proposal 4 does not directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(a) and (B) of the Statute and is negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 36 FLRA at 612; <span class="Italic">SSA, Vallejo</span>, 35 FLRA at 1284; <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>, 23 FLRA at 174-75.</p>
<p class="noindent">Affirming the <span class="Italic">Local 1974</span> result, the D.C. Circuit concluded in <span class="Italic">VA v. FLRA</span>, 33 F.3d 1391, 1394-95 (D.C. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We...accord particular deference to the FLRA when the question involves, as it does here, "the distinction between proposals encroaching on management's nonnegotiable substantive authority and those concerning properly negotiable procedural matters...." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 691 F.2d 553, 561 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether the FLRA correctly found Proposals 3 and 4 negotiable requires a rudimentary understanding of the statistical principles at work here.&#x2003;Any sampling involves a margin of error. Suppose that a jar contains 100 marbles, of which ten are red. If an individual randomly selects 50 marbles from the jar, he may have anywhere from ten red marbles to none. If he selects all ten of them, the red marbles will comprise 20 percent of the sample; but he would obviously be wrong to infer that 20 percent of all the marbles in the jar were red.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To cope with this probability of error, statisticians have developed the concept of "standard deviation" ("SD") to establish a range of numbers around the mean on which one may rely with a given degree of confidence--the broader the range, the greater the confidence. A 3SD table will reflect three times the range of numbers as a one standard deviation table, but it will yield a confidence level of 99.7 percent as opposed to 68.3 percent for the one standard deviation table. <span class="Italic">See</span> Morris Hamburg, <span class="Italic">Basic Statistics </span>68 (2d ed. 1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the "8.0" percent column in the VA's 3SD table, we find a range of 17.40 to 0.00 percent where 75 is the size of the sample. According to this table, a random sample of 75 cases yielding six errors--an error rate of 8 percent--indicates that the total population has a true error rate that might lie anywhere from slightly above zero to 17.40 percent. Or, to return to the marble analogy, in a random sample of 75 marbles from a jar, by selecting six red marbles, one can be 99.7 percent certain that no more than 17.40 percent of all marbles in the jar are red. The VA complains that if this table is used in applying its percentage error standard, it would have to grant a "fully successful" performance rating to employees committing up to 13 errors (75 cases x 17.40%) instead of limiting the award to those who have committed no more than six (75 cases x 8%). Therefore, while use of the 3SD table might ensure a 99.7 percent degree of confidence that all percentage-error-rated employees whose total work is 92 percent error free will receive their "fully successful" performance ratings, it will also ensure that a significant number with higher percentages of error will be so rated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA concludes from this that Proposal 3 would effect a change in its percentage error performance standard.&#x2003;This argument misconstrues the nature of the proposal. To be sure, "the content of performance standards is nonnegotiable." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ.</span> <span class="Italic">Ass'n, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (proposal is nonnegotiable in that it "intrudes on management's exclusive right to determine the substance <span id="page_1099"></span>of performance standards, and is outside the agency's duty to bargain.") As the FLRA noted, however, Proposal 3 "concerns only the evaluative methodology used to measure error rate." <span class="Italic">Local 1974</span>, 46 F.L.R.A. at 1177. It does not interfere with the VA's "discretion to establish its performance standards and to determine its evaluative methodology<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are faced with a problem that is inherent in any resort to sampling in order to ascertain the performance of a particular individual.&#x2003;Because of the inevitable margins of error, any methodology chosen will tend to be either over- or underinclusive. The VA's denial of a favorable rating to any percentage performance employee who has committed seven or more substantive errors in a sample of 75 cases will no doubt succeed in minimizing the number of unqualified employees who are given the favorable rating. On the other hand, the agency will withhold its "fully successful" rating if it discovers errors in seven out of a sample of 75 of the 2,000 cases an employee may have handled during the year even if those seven were the only errors that employee had committed. Thus the VA's approach will reduce the risk of giving a favorable rating to unqualified workers at the cost of excluding others who are fully qualified. By the same token, while the Union's proposal may ensure that virtually all employees who are entitled to the "fully satisfactory" rating will receive it, it will also allow a substantial number of the unqualified to slip through the door.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact remains, however, that Proposal 3 would affect neither the VA's choice of a 92 percent error-free standard nor its decision to rely on a 75-case sample in determining which employees will be awarded its "fully successful" rating. <span class="Italic">Compare National Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1454 and Veterans Admin.</span>, 26 F.L.R.A. 848, 852 (1987) (proposals concerning use of standard deviation table were nonnegotiable because they "prescrib[ed] the particular method by which the Agency must sample employees' work"). Rather, the proposal concerns the methodology to be applied in determining whether an employee has met the VA's standard. Such a requirement is manifestly procedural and therefore negotiable under section 7106(b)(2)<span class="Italic">. See American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 3172 and Dep't of Health and Human Services</span>, 35 FLRA 1276, 1284 (1990) (proposals requiring the use of "commonly accepted" statistical techniques are negotiable as they neither "interfere with management's choice of evaluation methodology nor do they preclude the Agency from taking personnel actions based on application of the selected methodology").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the same reasons, we conclude that Proposal 4 is procedural and hence negotiable. The nature of the proposal is not affected by the fact that it would apply the 3SD table to ascertain compliance with an allowable error standard when an expanded rather than a standard sample is employed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA concludes with two arguments, neither of them persuasive. First, it contends that the FLRA's decision represented an unreasoned departure from its precedent. This argument is meritless in light of <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 3172</span>, where the FLRA approved as negotiable a proposal requiring the compilation of statistical data "using commonly accepted statistical techniques." 35 F.L.R.A. at 1283. Second, the VA urges that the FLRA's ruling on Proposals 3 and 4 is inconsistent with its determination that Proposal 5 was nonnegotiable. Proposal 5 required that "[o]nly records which can be verified as accurate [may] be used to evaluate performance." <span class="Italic">Local 1974</span>, 46 F.L.R.A. at 1179. The FLRA found it nonnegotiable because it "precludes the Agency from using certain information in evaluating employee performance<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1180. The VA finds Proposals 3 and 4 virtually indistinguishable from Proposal 5 because, as it sees it, they would deny it the use of samples of its employees' work unless "statistically validated." The simple answer is that Proposals 3 and 4 deal with methodology; they do not eliminate any information from the agency's consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal affected the manner of reporting work errors and modified the basis for an agency to discipline its employees. The proposal directly interfered with management's right to discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1822 and VAMC, Waco</span>, 9 FLRA 709 (1982). Proposals scheduling certain work and establishing recordation requirements infringed on management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3511 and VA Hosp., San Antonio</span>, 12 FLRA 76 (1983). A proposed elimination of log-keeping requirements was outside the duty to bargain. It involved the method of work performance. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3511 and VA Hosp., San Antonio</span>, 12 FLRA 76 (1983). A proposal stating who would conduct a work count was not negotiable. It interfered with management's right to assign work by dictating who would be assigned the job of performing counts. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 7 FLRA 235, 239-40 (1981) (Proposal 6). Management was not required to negotiate a proposal that defined how elapsed time would be determined for purposes of applying numeric performance standards. The proposal required management to negotiate the timeliness of work and required negotiation of performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Vallejo Dist. Office</span>, 35 FLRA 1276, 1287 (1990) (Proposal 8; record not sufficiently developed for determination of arrangements analysis).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NWSEA and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA</span>, 63 FLRA 450, 452-53 (2009), was Provision 3, "A pre-established distribution of ratings (i.e., a quota) shall not be permitted":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Provision 3</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under its terms, Provision 3 would prevent the Agency from utilizing a ratings quota when rating employees. As argued by the Agency, the Authority has held that the evaluation of employee performance, including the right to determine the ratings to be given to individual employees, constitutes an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1760,</span> 28 FLRA at 169. By failing to respond to the Agency's SOP, the Union concedes that Provision 3 affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1226,</span> 62 FLRA 459, 460 (2008); <span class="Italic">NLRB Union and NLRB Prof'l Ass'n,</span> 62 FLRA 397, 401-03 (2008) <span class="Italic">(NLRB), aff'd sub nom. NLRB Union v. FLRA,</span> 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 3280 (D.C. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1712,</span> 62 FLRA 15, 16-17 (2007); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2) (a party's "[f]ailure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion."). Accordingly, as the Union does not dispute the Agency's claim, we find that Provision 3 affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) is limited by "applicable laws." <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 42 FLRA 377, 388-91 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds,</span> 966 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Thus, proposals or provisions that require an agency to exercise its management's rights in accordance with applicable laws do not interfere with such rights and are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its petition for review, the Union asserts that Provision 3 "restates the wording of Section 4.01.k of the [DAO] which...guarantees the protections and provisions of 5 [C.F.R. &#x00A7;] 430.20[8](c)." However, the Union does not explicitly argue that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208 constitutes an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Further, the Union does not explicitly assert either that compliance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208 renders the provision negotiable, or that such compliance establishes that the provision does not conflict with managements rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). As such, the Union has failed to expressly state "[w]hether and why the...provision enforces an 'applicable law,' within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7106(a)(2)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.25(c)(1)(iv); <span class="Italic">see also NLRB,</span> 62 FLRA at 401-02. Further, the Union does not assert that the provision is encompassed by any of the exceptions to management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b). Accordingly, we find that Provision 3 is outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
