<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-91"><span class="space">l.</span> Requirement Similar to Security Clearance; Public Trust Position</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may have a program that looks and feels like a security clearance but it is called something else. That something was a "Personnel Reliability Program" (PRP) in <span class="Italic">Dodson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 562, 567-68 (1987). The PRP was essentially a status that the appellant, a quality assurance specialist being trained in the handling of nuclear ammunition, maintained to stay in his job. The status was lost when the agency decided both that the employee acted negligently in some past work and that the employee became involved in an emotional incident relating to his marriage. Without saying much about the nature of the PRP, the Board affirmed dismissal--not for any failings of the employee in the training program itself, but for behavior that disqualified the appellant from maintaining his PRP status, a condition to continuation in the training program. <span class="Italic">Dodson</span> determined that the appellant's conduct, coupled with psychiatric and psychological reports, established that the appellant was properly disqualified under the regulations governing the PRP and that the disqualification from PRP participation was a proper basis for his removal. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. Dept. of Energy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170911046">870 F.3d 1185</a>, 1189 (10th Cir. 2017) ("Department's HRP-revocation [Human Reliability Program] decision was a security-clearance decision under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. On the second inquiry, we conclude that Sanchez's procedural-due-process claim challenges the merits or motives of that decision but that his failure-to-accommodate claim does not."). Of a challenge to a removal based on decertification from an Individual Responsibility Program, <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-21-0271-I-1, n.2 (NP 6/28/2022), explained the Board's inability to look behind the decertification on due process grounds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant alleges that the agency committed harmful procedural error because it failed to provide him with due process rights, i.e. notice and an opportunity to respond, regarding its decision to decertify him from the Individual Responsibility Program (IRP), due process rights are not extended to an agency's discretionary decision to revoke a previously granted privilege. <span class="Italic">See Holton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 688, &#x00B6; 29 (2016) (finding that the agency was entitled to revoke the appellant's privilege to report to duty, although he remained in a pay status, after a failed drug test without affording him due process), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 884 F.3d 1142 (Fed. Cir. 2018); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988) (observing that an employee does not have a right to a security clearance because granting of such a clearance is a discretionary act); <span class="Italic">Gargiulo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 727 F.3d 1181, 1184-85 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (finding that, because an employee does not have a property interest in a security clearance, its revocation does not implicate due process). Because granting the IRP certification is a discretionary act by the agency, the agency has a right to revoke it without extending due process rights. The appellant did receive all appropriate due process rights regarding his removal from the Federal service, which was based, in part, on his failure to a maintain a condition of employment, namely the IRP certification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mungo v. Dept. of Army</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP) (arbitrator's review provided sufficient due process through post-deprivation review of loss of IRP credential).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency certification for sensitive work was revisited in <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 688, 689-95 (1994). The appellant held a certification, similar to that held by the appellant in <span class="Italic">Dodson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, necessary for employees who worked with or around chemical agents and weapons. The appellant, a GS-7 Security Guard, lost his certification and as a result, his job, when he allegedly "verbally assaulted" another officer. The Army argued that the Board should not second-guess the agency's determination as to whether the appellant should lose his certification. The Board disagreed: the certification was not the equivalent of a security clearance; it could review the agency action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency based its action on the appellant's permanent disqualification from its Chemical Personnel Reliability Program (CPRP); it asserted that the appellant's position required him to remain qualified under the CPRP and that it had unsuccessfully searched for vacant positions to which he could be assigned that did not have this requirement. The CPRP was established by the agency as part of its Chemical Surety Program, which "is designed to ensure the safety, security, and reliability of chemical agents and weapons in the custody of the U.S. Army and provides controls to prevent chemical accidents, incidents and unauthorized use of agents and weapons." The agency assesses "the reliability and acceptability of individuals being considered for and assigned to chemical duty positions" and grants, denies, or revokes certification under the CPRP based on that assessment. The appellant was disqualified from the CPRP based on an alleged incident in which he verbally assaulted a Security Officer; the agency asserted that this incident demonstrated the appellant's poor judgment, contempt for authority, and an unprofessional attitude when working with others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disputed this account of the incident underlying his disqualification and also challenged the reasonableness of the agency's removal penalty. The agency moved the administrative judge to limit the scope of his review to the following: (1) Whether qualification under the CPRP was required for the appellant to remain in his position; (2) whether the appellant was disqualified from the CPRP; and (3) whether the appellant was afforded minimum due process by the agency's decision to disqualify him from the CPRP. It argued that removal of the appellant based on his disqualification from the CPRP was akin to a removal based on the loss of a security clearance and that the Board's authority to review the appeal thus was limited by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a hearing, the administrative judge mitigated the appellant's removal to a 30-day suspension. He concluded that the Board's scope of review was not limited by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, finding that the absence of any statutory provision precluding appellate review of removals based on the loss of CPRP qualification created a strong presumption in favor of appellate review. On the merits, he found that the appellant had engaged in the misconduct charged by the agency but determined that a 30-day suspension was the maximum reasonable penalty for the misconduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, the Board found that, in an adverse action proceeding based substantially on the agency's denial or revocation of a security clearance, its review is limited to determining that the agency has established the following: (1) Requirement of a security clearance for the position in question; (2) loss or denial of the security clearance; and (3) granting of minimal due process protections to the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 MSPR 509, 520 (1985). The Board emphasized that the commitment of security clearance matters to agency discretion was analogous to the deference with which courts have treated matters traditionally within military purview. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 516. In this context, it cited <span class="Italic">Mindes v. Seaman</span>, 453 F.2d 197, 199-201 (5th Cir. 1971), in which the court pointed to several considerations militating against judicial review, including peculiar military expertise; concern over stultifying the vital missions of the military; and judicial inclination to commit the matter in question to the military. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 28 MSPR at 517. The court stated that these considerations were to be weighed against the nature and strength of the appellant's claim, and the potential of injury if review were denied; on balance, the court found that there was a "judicial policy akin to comity." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mindes</span>, 453 F.2d at 199, 201.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also cited cases that it had decided which were based upon considerations similar to those outlined in <span class="Italic">Mindes</span>, where it held that it would not review the reasons underlying adverse actions where those actions were based on, respectively, criminal conviction or bar decertification. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 28 MSPR at 517-18 (citations omitted). The Board found that in these cases, the underlying actions had been committed to appropriate procedures within the respective entities and that they involved determinations wherein the Board lacked a specific grant of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 518.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching the result in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the Board found that the national security considerations inherent in a security clearance determination were simply too sensitive to permit Board review of the reasons underlying such a determination. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> It further concluded that the countervailing factors mentioned in <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> relating to the nature of the claim and potential for injury to the appellant were addressed to the extent that the agency or applicable entity had a procedure for affording at least minimum due process protections, including notice of the agency's determination, a statement of the reasons in support of the determination, and an opportunity for the affected individual to be heard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 519.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 802 F.2d 1563 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The Supreme Court reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 525-34, 108 S. Ct. at 823-27. The Court noted that the Court of Appeals' decision was based partly on the premise that the absence of any statutory provision precluding appellate review of security clearance denials in adverse action removal cases created a strong presumption in favor of appellate review. <span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 525-26, 108 S. Ct. at 823, citing 802 F.2d at 1569. It concluded, however, that this statement, while valid as a general proposition of administrative law,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">runs aground when it encounters concerns of national security, as <span id="Page_2585"></span>in this case, where the grant of security clearance to a particular employee, a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 527, 108 S. Ct. at 823-24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court found in this regard that the Executive Branch's authority to regulate the access of Federal employees to national security information was based on the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and had been delegated to the heads of departments and agencies. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 527-28, 108 S. Ct. at 824. It stated that no one had a "right" to a security clearance and that the granting of a security clearance required an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. It further noted that a clearance did not equate with passing judgment upon an individual's character but instead constituted an attempt to predict future behavior and to assess whether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, an individual might compromise sensitive information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> The Court concluded that such an attempt to define not only the individual's future actions, but also those of outside and unknown influences, rendered the granting of a security clearance "'an inexact science at best.'" <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 529, 108 S. Ct. at 825, citing <span class="Italic">Adams v. Laird</span>, 420 F.2d 230, 239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 397 U.S. 1039, 90 S. Ct. 1360, 25 L. Ed.2d 650 (1970).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It therefore determined that predictive judgment of this kind had to be made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified information and that it was not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the merits of such a judgment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 529-30, 108 S. Ct. at 825. The Court reasoned that such a body could not determine what constituted an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk....&#8197;In finding that such a judgment call must be left to the agency heads entrusted with the responsibility of protecting classified information, it concluded by remarking that the courts had traditionally been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since its decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the Board has addressed several situations in which an appellant has lost an agency-controlled certification (other than a security clearance) and has thereafter been removed<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., McGillivray v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 58 MSPR 398, 402-03 (1993) (revocation of procurement authority); <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 684, 687-88, 690-91 (1988) (revocation of clinical privileges); and <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 MSPR 16, 18-19 (1986) (loss of medical certification). The Board held there, however, that it could review the validity of the underlying agency determinations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. It concluded that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> addresses only those adverse actions which are based substantially on an agency's revocation or denial of an employee's security clearance; it found that the issues raised by the loss of procurement authority, clinical privileges, or a medical certification were not similar enough to those raised by security clearance determinations or military selection processes to require the Board to limit the scope of its review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Boulineau v. Department of the Army</span>, the Board found that it could consider the merits and a claim of age discrimination where a civilian employee had been removed from his Helicopter Flight Instructor position based on a medical disqualification. <span class="Italic">See</span> 57 MSPR 244, 247-49 &#x0026; n.6 (1993). In reaching this result, the Board acknowledged the general military exception to appellate review, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 248-49 &#x0026; n.6, but found that it extended only to cases involving military personnel or matters of inherently military concern. It therefore concluded that it could review the merits of a medical disqualification and that it could entertain the appellant's age discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board has addressed a case in which an appellant was removed based upon his disqualification from a Personnel Reliability Program designed to safeguard the agency's stockpile of nuclear munitions. <span class="Italic">See Dodson v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 562, 564-65 &#x0026; n.1 (1987). The Board did consider the underlying merits of the removal in sustaining the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 566-68. The issue regarding the proper scope of review that the agency has raised in this appeal, however, was not recognized or addressed by the parties or the Board in <span class="Italic">Dodson. See id.</span> at 564-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CPRP is designed to help ensure the safety, security, and reliability of chemical weapons in the agency's custody and to prevent chemical accidents, incidents, and the unauthorized use of those weapons. It accomplishes this objective through a process that identifies positions requiring access to chemical weapons and that continuously evaluates the acceptability and reliability of individuals occupying those positions. The qualifying and disqualifying factors for participation in the CPRP involve performance and conduct but also concern the ability of an employee to react to changing situations with dependability, emotional stability, proper social adjustment, sound judgment, and a positive attitude toward the objectives of the CPRP as well as toward the law and other duly constituted authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that we may review the underlying disqualification of the appellant from the CPRP and that the scope of our review is not limited in accordance with the analysis set forth by the Board and the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. The role of protecting the national chemical weapons program is, without doubt, a very important role. The importance of that role, however, should not divest civilian employees who work in that program of the basic employment protections guaranteed them under law. Neither should the "military" nature of such employment, nor should the program's requirements for the ability to react to changing situations with dependability, emotional stability, proper social adjustment, sound judgment, and a positive attitude toward program objectives and duly constituted authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical nature of the work performed by CPRP employees simply does not require that they be denied access to the Board. Many agencies have employees who do work as important and with as far-reaching consequences as that performed by CPRP employees, yet those employees will receive Board review of the merits of removal actions taken by their agencies. The engineer at the National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration, the medical researcher at the National Institutes of Health, the air-traffic controller at the Federal Aviation Administration--each of these employees performs critical work and each may seek full Board review of an agency action within our jurisdiction. Clearly, this similarity in the important nature of assigned responsibilities does not require that CPRP employees be denied a review right before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that there are countless positions throughout government requiring that the incumbents be dependable, stable, socially adjusted, of sound judgment, and positive in attitude. While some of these positions are in the military branches, many others are not, and it is obviously not the requirement for these traits that would exclude these employees from the Board's protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also suggests that, as an outside nonexpert body, the Board should not second-guess its inherently imprecise attempts under the CPRP to predict the appellant's future behavior. Its use of the Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 484 U.S. at 529-30, 108 S. Ct. at 825, is misplaced in the context of a CPRP decertification. It is fair to say that most of the removal actions taken by agencies are based at least in part on an attempt to predict an employee's future behavior. In <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 305-06 (1981), the Board set forth a range of factors that an agency should consider in making a penalty determination, which included an estimate of the employee's potential for rehabilitation. The basis of progressive discipline is that an employee who has engaged in repeated misconduct will be likely to do so again in the future. When an agency acts based on such predictions in imposing a penalty, the Board is required by its statutory mandate to review the propriety of those agency judgments. The Board's case law is therefore replete with decisions in which the Board has "second-guessed" agencies as to these predictions regarding an employee's future conduct and potential for rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was narrow in scope and specifically applied only to security clearance revocations. As the protector of the government's merit systems, the Board is not eager to expand the scope of the rationale in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to divest federal employees whose positions do not require a security clearance of basic protections against non-meritorious agency actions. The administrative judge found that the appellant's position required a security clearance but that, because of his CPRP decertification and subsequent removal, no decision was ever made regarding the possible revocation of his security clearance. We agree with the administrative judge that if the work assigned to the appellant was so important and so intimately related to national security that the agency could not tolerate Board review of its disciplinary actions, it could have revoked the appellant's security clearance and avoided review of the merits of a removal based on such a revocation. It did not, however, choose to do so. That act alone distinguishes this case from the situation addressed by the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits, we discern no error in the rationale for the administrative judge's mitigation of the appellant's removal to a 30-day suspension and affirm his finding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Griego v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-1221-15-0427-W-1 (NP 3/11/2016) (merits resolution of a whistleblower reprisal claim concerning suspension of PRP eligibility); <span class="Italic">Arthur v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 239, 243 (1982) (conviction for disorderly conduct did not alone provide a presumption of nexus sufficient to warrant the removal of an employee whose emotional stability and good judgment were requirements for retention in the CPRP program).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Public trust positions were briefly described in a decision sustaining removal of an appellant who failed to meet the criteria for that position when it was a requirement of his job, <span class="Italic">Franqui v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-14-0147-I-1 (NP 11/20/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-7 armed Security Guard, was required to pass a public trust background investigation and reinvestigation every ten years as a condition of his employment. In 2013, his position sensitivity <span id="Page_2586"></span>increased to high risk public trust, and he was required to undergo an upgraded background reinvestigation in order to meet the position requirements....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having not received any mitigating information from the appellant, the security office issued an adverse background reinvestigation determination finding that the appellant could no longer occupy any public trust or low risk/non-sensitive position. As a result, the agency proposed to remove the appellant for failure to meet a condition of employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The charge of failure to fulfill a condition of employment contains two elements that the agency must prove: (1) the requirement at issue is a condition of employment; and (2) the appellant failed to meet that condition. <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 6 (2014). Absent evidence of bad faith or patent unfairness, the Board defers to the agency's requirements that must be fulfilled for an individual to qualify for appointment to, or to retain, a particular position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant's position required him to successfully pass a public trust background investigation, and that he failed to do so. The appellant does not dispute that he was subject to this condition of employment or that he failed to meet it. Likewise, he has not alleged, much less shown, that the agency's application of the employment condition was patently unfair or based on bad faith. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also Gallegos</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 11. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency proved by preponderant evidence that: (1) obtaining a favorable public trust background reinvestigation determination was a condition of the appellant's employment; and (2) the appellant failed to meet this condition. We also agree that a nexus exists between the sustained charge and the efficiency of the federal service as the appellant could no longer hold his public trust position or perform his duties. <span class="Italic">See Penland v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). Finally, the appellant does not challenge, and we discern no reason to disturb, the administrative judge's conclusion that the penalty of removal is reasonable for the sustained charge. <span class="Italic">See also Penland</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12.</p>
