<p class="noindent">Allegations that the union is not a labor organization because it has not complied with &#x00A7; 7120 requirements are presented through complaints of standards of conduct violations filed with the Assistant Secretary for Labor Management Relations, whose decisions are enforced pursuant to Part 2428 of the Authority's regulations. Lacking evidence that there is a proceeding before the Assistant Secretary, the FLRA will not probe into an assertion that the petitioning labor organization violated the standards of conduct. <span class="Italic">Ft. Knox Dependent Sch. and Ft. Knox Teachers Ass'n</span>, 5 FLRA 33, 36 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a question is raised in a representation case concerning the filing of documents with FLRA, described in &#x00A7; 7111(e) ("[a] labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the Authority and the agency involved a roster of its officer and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives"), the matter is to be administratively resolved by the regional director; it is not a matter litigable in a ULP proceeding. Standards of conduct problems are resolved by the Assistant Secretary of Labor. <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE</span>, 5 FLRA 126, 128 (1981). A question concerning union compliance with standards of conduct belongs before the Assistant Secretary (<span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE</span>, 5 FLRA 126, 127 (1981), but issues that are properly raised in a ULP context, e.g., the legitimacy of participation in unions by supervisors, are not excluded from FLRA consideration because the Assistant Secretary may possess concurrent review authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2513 v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 174, 181 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-66 and Confer</span>, 17 FLRA 796, 813-14 (1985) (ALJ Decision) (concerning internal union discipline: it was inappropriate for union to remove individual from membership for causing other employees to file ULP charges against union).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA and VA Indep. Union</span>, 35 FLRA 172, 176-78 (1990), considered, on challenge to a regional determination, whether the petitioner constituted a labor organization within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(4), stating that a labor organization "means an organization...in which employees participate and pay dues." Petitioner did not have a provision in its constitution or by-laws that directly regulated the assessment of dues. FLRA concluded that nothing in the Statute required a statement of dues procedure in the union's organic documents. It determined that "[a]lthough such a written and published statement is to be encouraged as basic, responsible practice, we do not believe that the absence of such a written provision supports a conclusion that employees do not pay dues." Instead, FLRA considered the practices of the union, found that employees did pay dues to the organization, and declared it to be a union within the meaning of the Statute. FLRA noted that the petitioner was in the formative stages of its organization, and it would not be expected to operate with the degree of formality or precision expected of an established labor union. FLRA went on to state that "we would in certain circumstances find such an organization to be a labor organization even if no dues, fees or assessments had yet been collected so long as its intent to do so was established and such future dues payment was not speculative." <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">PBGC and Ind. U. of Pension Employee</span>, 65 FLRA 635, 637 (2011) ("&#x00A7; 7103(a)(4) and the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs </span>do not require that newly formed organizations must actually have collected dues money no later than the date of certification, or within any specific period of time thereafter, in order to qualify as a labor organization.").</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7111(f)(1) prevents the grant of exclusive recognition to a union if FLRA determines that the organization is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles. <span class="Italic">Div. of Military and Naval Affairs and NFCT</span>, 53 FLRA 111, 112-113, 118-126 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">New York Nat'l Guard</span>"), considered the approach FLRA would take when a union's status is challenged under &#x00A7; 7111(f)(1). The matter will be determined with regard to any concurrent proceedings before the Department of Labor, and representation proceedings will be suspended pending that result. FLRA left open what course it would pursue if related proceedings were not pending before the Labor Department or another agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1970, ACT was certified as the exclusive representative of a unit of employees of the Activity, Division of Military Affairs, New York National Guard (NYNG). In this case, NFCT filed a petition seeking an election to represent the NYNG employees currently represented by ACT. ACT asserted that the RD should dismiss NFCT's petition on the basis that NFCT is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles and, therefore, that NFCT is not entitled to exclusive recognition under section 7111(f)(1) of the Statute, which provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;if the Authority determines that the labor organization is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ACT also filed a complaint under section 7120 of the Statute with the Assistant Secretary of Labor, claiming that by the same allegedly corrupt or anti-democratic conduct, NFCT violated the standards of conduct for labor organizations. On August 25, 1995, DOL notified ACT that <span id="Page_240"></span>the complaint was without merit, and that "[t]he OLMS National Office and the Department of Labor's Office of the Solicitor concur with this decision."...&#8197;[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;ACT also filed an unfair labor practice charge alleging violations of 7116(b)(1), (2) and (8) of the Statute. The RD found that those allegations were also the subject of ACT's 7111(f)(1) "challenge" in this RO proceeding. That charge was dismissed (BN-CO-5O395, April 10, 1995), and an appeal of the dismissal to the General Counsel was denied on February 29, 1996.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is a case of first impression concerning section 7111(f)(1) of the Statute. The Authority has not previously issued a decision involving this section, and the legislative history of the Statute sheds no light on the appropriate interpretation and application of the section. Further, the predecessor to the Statute, Executive Order 11491, contained no equivalent to section 7111 and the NLRA has no similar provisions. However, both sections 7120(b) and 7111(f)(1) contain similar prohibitions on corrupt and anti-democratic influences in Federal sector labor organizations.[9] Consistent with the "whole statute" principle of statutory construction, the meaning of an individual section of a statute is determined in reference to the entire statutory scheme. Sutherland, Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 46.05 (5th Ed.). That is, "all sections of an act relating to the same subject matter should be considered together unless to do so would be plainly contrary to the legislative intent. Insofar as possible, the separate effect of each individual part or section of an act is made consistent with the whole<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 47.06. Guided by this principle, we interpret our obligations concerning claims filed under section 7111(f) as discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;As relevant here, section 7120 differs from section 7111(f)(1) only in that it uses the phrase "corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles" to describe prohibited conduct, while section 7111(f)(1) omits the modifier "basic." As no reason is alleged or apparent for construing these phrases in the two sections differently, we attribute to them the same meaning. Hereafter, both are referred to as "corrupt and anti-democratic influences."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority Makes Determinations Concerning</span> <span class="Italic">Exclusive Recognition under Section 7111(f)(1</span>) <span class="Italic">of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is unquestioned that only the Authority has jurisdiction to decide issues relating to the granting of exclusive recognition to labor organizations representing employees in the Federal sector. Section 7111(f)(1) states that exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization if the Authority determines that the labor organization is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles. Thus, freedom from corrupt and anti-democratic influences is a requirement that must be met before the Authority can certify a labor organization as an exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Framework for Deciding Challenges to Exclusive</span> <span class="Italic">Recognition Under Section 7111(f)(1) of the</span> <span class="Italic">Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. <span class="Italic">A Labor Organization Is Presumed Free from</span> <span class="Italic">Corrupt and Anti-Democratic Influences</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute does not define the terms "corrupt influences" or "influences opposed to democratic principles" in either section 7111(f) or section 7120. However, section 7120(a) establishes a presumption that a labor organization is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences if the union is subject to governing requirements that meet specified standards. This is a rebuttable presumption; section 7120(b) provides that, regardless of whether a union has subscribed to standards of conduct as provided in subsection (a), it must furnish evidence of freedom from corrupt and anti-democratic influences if there is reasonable cause to believe that the union: (1) has been suspended or expelled from an international union or federation of unions because of a demonstrated unwillingness to comply with proper governing requirements; or (2) is, in fact, subject to influences that are corrupt or opposed to democratic principles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of proceedings before the Authority to resolve a challenge under section 7111(f)(1), and consistent with the "whole statute" principle of statutory construction, we will henceforth apply the presumption established in section 7120(a)--that a labor organization subject to certain delineated governing standards is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences--which may be rebutted by establishing reasonable cause as provided in section 7120(b). We do so based on the factors noted above: (1) the similarity of language and subject matter in section 7111(f)(1) and section 7120; (2) the absence of any definition of "corrupt influences" or "influences opposed to democratic principles" within the context of either section; and (3) the absence of any indication that the two sections should be construed differently. Moreover, a review of the DOL regulations on Substantive Requirements Concerning Standards of Conduct, 29 CFR Part 458, leads to the conclusion that section 7120 envelops the corrupt or anti-democratic influences referenced in section 7111(f)(1).[10] In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that Congress intended the Authority to look to section 7120 when determining whether a labor organization is presumed free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences or whether that presumption has been rebutted. If a party establishes reasonable cause to rebut the presumption, the Authority would then determine whether the labor organization is rendered ineligible to serve as an exclusive representative under section 7111(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Section 7120 specifies that DOL shall prescribe the regulations necessary to carry out "the purposes of this section" and also requires that the regulations conform to the "principles" of the standards applied to unions in the private sector. DOL's regulations set forth virtually the identical enforcement scheme for violations of the Statute's union democracy provisions as apply to violations of the LMRDA<span class="Italic">. Local 1219, American Federation of Government Employees </span>v. <span class="Italic">Donovan</span>, 683 F.2d 511, 515 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1982). Moreover, those regulations require that "[i]n applying the standards contained in this subpart the Assistant Secretary will be guided by the interpretations and policies followed by the Department of Labor in applying the provisions of the LMRDA and by applicable court decisions." 29 CFR 458.1. Congress passed the LMRDA to ensure that elections "would remain free from the abusive and corrupt influences which plagued the unions for years. Thus, the Act's ultimate goal was to provide for 'free and democratic, elections[.]" <span class="Italic">Brock</span> <span class="Italic">v. Local 150, United Paperworkers Int'l</span>, 670 F. Supp. 213, 216 (N.D. Ohio 1986), quoting <span class="Italic">Wirtz v. Hotel, Motel &#x0026; Club Employees Union</span>, 391 U.S. 492 (1968). Clearly, regulations governing a finding in a section 7120 proceeding, which is based on the LMRDA model, would be pertinent to a section 7111(f)(1) challenge before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a section 7111(f)(1) proceeding, the presumption in section 7120(a) attaches if the labor organization is subject to the governing requirements set out in section 7120(a)(1) through (4). This may be demonstrated by submission of a constitution and bylaws that meet the criteria set forth in section 7120(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. <span class="Italic">Reasonable Cause May Be Established to Rebut</span> <span class="Italic">the Presumption that a Labor Organization is</span> <span class="Italic">Free From Corrupt and Anti-democratic</span> <span class="Italic">Influences</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The presumption that a labor organization is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences, established by meeting the requirements of section 7120(a), may be rebutted by a showing that there is reasonable cause to believe that the labor organization is not free from such influences. As noted above, the standards for rebutting the presumption are set forth in section 7120(b). Under section 7120(b), the presumption may be rebutted based on reasonable cause to believe that: (1) the organization was suspended or expelled from, or was otherwise sanctioned by, a parent organization, or federation of organizations with which it had been affiliated, based on its demonstrated unwillingness or inability to comply with the governing procedures set out in 7120(a)(1) through (4); or (2) the labor organization is in fact subject to corrupt or anti-democratic influences. Based on the standards in section 7120 and the Authority's exclusive jurisdiction over representation matters, we have developed the following guidelines for analyzing whether, under section 7111(f)(1), the requisite reasonable cause has been established to rebut the presumption that the labor organization is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. <span class="Italic">A</span> <span class="Italic">Finding By A Third Party With</span> <span class="Italic">Jurisdiction Over the Allegations Asserted</span> <span class="Italic">To Establish Corrupt Or Anti-Democratic</span> <span class="Italic">Influences May Establish Reasonable Cause</span> <span class="Italic">for the Authority to Proceed With the</span> <span class="Italic">Section 7111(f)(1) Claim</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where another agency or entity has jurisdiction over the matter asserted to establish the requisite reasonable cause, the Authority will look to the disposition of charges or claims before such third party in determining the labor organization's eligibility to be accorded exclusive recognition. Relying on third party findings will allow us to conserve resources, take full advantage of the expertise of the third party, and administer the Statute in a comprehensive manner, as intended by Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the ACT's allegations were also the basis for a section 7120 complaint filed with DOL. The mandate of section 7120 and the applicable regulations suggest that most charges of conduct involving corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles are encompassed by DOL's enforcement of standards of conduct.[12] Where, as in this case, the charges are so encompassed, the need to avoid duplication of proceedings and ensure expeditious representation case processing leads us to conclude that, in determining whether reasonable cause has been established to proceed on a charge raised under 7111(f)(1), the Authority will rely on the findings of DOL concerning conduct that is the same or similar to conduct set forth in section 7120.[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12] For example, corrupt or anti-democratic influences within a <span id="Page_241"></span>labor organization could lead to election irregularities, the raising of dues without members' permission, or expulsion from membership without due process. Any of these alleged infractions could, in turn, provide the basis for a DOL standards of conduct complaint alleging a violation of the bill of rights of members of labor organizations, 29 CFR 458.2, and could result in a section 7120 violation. Thus, although DOL does not make determinations as to whether a union is subject to corrupt and anti-democratic influences so as to preclude the union from serving as an exclusive representative under section 7111(f)(1) of the Statute, DOL's investigations and findings regarding standards of conduct violations under section 7120 will in most instances encompass allegedly corrupt or anti-democratic activity. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 174, 177-78 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (although Authority has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate unfair labor practice charges, the Assistant Secretary of Labor and the FLRA have concurrent jurisdiction to administer section 7120).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] Although we anticipate that most claims asserted under section 7111(f)(1) will, like the claim at issue here, present allegations that also may be asserted as a standards of conduct violation within the jurisdiction of DOL, we recognize that some may not implicate section 7120. For example, the General Counsel suggests that proceedings under RICO may also provide a basis for finding reasonable cause to proceed with a section 7111(f)(1) allegation. Applying the approach we adopt today with regard to charges within the jurisdiction of DOL, the Authority would rely in such cases on the findings of the third party with jurisdiction over the underlying claim. In other cases, it may be appropriate for the Authority to look to other proceedings under the Statute, such as Authority unfair labor practice decisions finding violations of section 7116(b)(1) based on persistent, pervasive violations of the duty of fair representation or other conduct by the accused labor organization that is incompatible with exclusive recognition. In establishing procedures for deciding all such issues, we will be guided by the importance of avoiding duplication of proceedings and unwarranted delay in the processing of representation cases. In the event that claims are presented to us that are not subject to another third party's jurisdiction, or cognizable in an existing proceeding, we will address at that time the appropriate procedures to follow in resolving the issues in dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, if a third party with jurisdiction over the conduct alleged to establish the requisite reasonable cause finds a violation based on the same facts raised by the section 7111(f)(1) challenge, the Authority will accept that finding as evidence that there is reasonable cause to believe that the presumption of freedom from corrupt and anti-democratic influences has been rebutted. In such circumstances, consistent with the requirements of section 7120(b), the labor organization must furnish evidence to the RD of its freedom from such influences.<span class="Italic"> See </span>Section IV.B.3, below.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dismissal By a Third Party, Such as DOL</span>, <span class="Italic">Will Suffice to Establish the Absence of</span> <span class="Italic">Reasonable Cause to Believe That Denial of</span> <span class="Italic">Certification Is Required Under Section</span> <span class="Italic">7111(f)(1</span>)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the third party with jurisdiction over the conduct alleged to establish reasonable cause dismisses the charge before it, the Authority will accept this as evidence that reasonable cause does not exist to overcome the presumption that the labor organization is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences. In such circumstances, the Authority will proceed accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The</span> <span class="Italic">Authority Will Stay Its Proceedings</span> <span class="Italic">When a Case Is Pending Before a Third</span> <span class="Italic">Party That Is Based on the Same or</span> <span class="Italic">Substantially Similar Allegations That</span> <span class="Italic">Support the Section 7111(f)(1) Claim</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In matters subject to a third party's jurisdiction, if a complaint is pending before such a third party at the time a section 7111(f)(1) challenge is filed, the Authority will stay its proceedings pending disposition of the third-party proceeding.[14] Similarly, if allegations concerning corrupt or anti-democratic influences are filed only with the Authority and are, in the RD's view, subject to a third party's jurisdiction, the RD should instruct the party filing the claim to first obtain a disposition of those matters that are within the third party's jurisdiction. The RD may also explain that, in so doing, the filing party should present its claim to the third party in a manner that is acceptable in that forum. For example, if the matter lies within the jurisdiction of DOL, the filing party should present the claim with the Assistant Secretary as a standards of conduct violation under section 7120, rather than as a claim of corrupt and anti-democratic influences.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14] Where appropriate, the Authority may direct that an election be held and the ballots be impounded pending the third party's determination and the pending Authority decision under section 7111(f)(1). This will ensure that the vote reflects the wishes of the bargaining unit at a time sufficiently proximate to the filing of the petition to preserve the rights of the employees under section 7102 of the Statute as well as the rights of the accused union should the Authority ultimately determine that it is not subject to corrupt or anti-democratic influences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If such third party action is initiated within a reasonable time, the Authority will stay any underlying representation petition until a decision is rendered.[15] If such action is not initiated with the third party within a reasonable time, the Authority, where appropriate, will apply the presumption contained in section 7120 and proceed accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15] Because of the damage to representation rights that can be caused by delay in processing a representational petition, however, the Authority will not stay section 7111 proceedings pending enforcement of a DOL decision under 5 CFR Part 2428 or pending court review. The Authority also will not stay its section 7111(f) proceedings pending third party action if it is clear that even if the facts alleged were true, they would not support a finding of corrupt or anti-democratic influences sufficient to render the labor organization ineligible to serve as the exclusive representative. The RD would base such a conclusion on a determination that a challenge is frivolous on its face or that the documentary evidence establishes that any violation would be <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> or has been cured. <span class="Italic">See</span> section IV.c.3 below.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">When Reasonable Cause Is Established to</span> <span class="Italic">Believe that a Labor Organization Is</span> <span class="Italic">Subject to Corrupt or Anti-Democratic</span> <span class="Italic">Influences, the Burden of Proof Shifts to</span> <span class="Italic">the Accused Labor Organization</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where it has been established that there is reasonable cause to believe that a labor organization is subject to corrupt or anti-democratic influences, the burden of proof under section 7111(f) shifts to the accused labor organization to demonstrate that it is, in fact, free from influences that would preclude recognition. In such cases, the Authority will determine whether the evidence shows that a labor organization has met this burden by demonstrating, for example, that: (1) the violation found by a third party has been cured (for example, that sanctions imposed by a parent organization have been lifted); or (2) the violation found by a third party is in effect <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> and thus is insufficient to warrant denial or revocation of certification.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16] In light of our disposition of this case, it is not necessary at this time to elaborate on the specific procedures the Authority will use to determine whether a labor organization has satisfied this burden.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of Analytical Framework to This Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed in this case that there is a presumption that NFCT is free from corrupt and anti-democratic influences. Therefore, the threshold issue is whether reasonable cause has been established to rebut that presumption. As discussed above, the Authority will not further examine claims that a union is subject to such influences if DOL has dismissed similar allegations subject to its jurisdiction under section 7120.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17] We note that among the protections provided in DOL's regulations governing standards of conduct proceedings is the right to appeal a DOL regional director's dismissal of a complaint to the Assistant Secretary. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 458.59. In the instant case, the record does not establish that an appeal was taken. Moreover, the dismissal letter by the DOL regional director noted concurrence by the OLMS National office and the Office of the Solicitor of Labor. Therefore, there is no section 7120 action currently pending.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of DOL's dismissal of ACT's claims in the section 7120 proceeding, we find no reasonable cause to believe that the Petitioner is subject to influences that would preclude its certification. Accordingly, there is no basis for further Authority proceedings to determine whether the Petitioner should be denied the opportunity to be accorded exclusive recognition on the ground that it is subject to corrupt or anti-democratic influences. Therefore, we direct the RD to resume processing the representation petition with the understanding that the Petitioner will be eligible to serve as the exclusive representative if it wins the election. Accordingly, we remand the case to the RD, with instructions to open and count the impounded ballots, and to take appropriate action based on the outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, there is no merit to ACT's contention that it was prejudiced because it was not allowed to present evidence at the hearing to support its claim that NFCT is subject to corrupt and anti-democratic influences. We have found that by reason of DOL's dismissal of the allegations brought under section 7120, reasonable cause has not been established to believe that NFCT is subject to such influences. Therefore, NFCT is not required to prove before the Authority that it is not subject to such influences. Accordingly, in view of our finding that the Authority will not proceed when, as here, a third party with jurisdiction has dismissed the same allegations, we find no merit in ACT's assertion of prejudice.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_242"></span>Once a union is certified, its status as a labor union may not be collaterally attacked in a representation proceeding, <span class="Italic">PBGC and Ind. U. of Pension Employee</span>, 65 FLRA 635, 637 (2011) (not discussing decertification):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Petitioner argues that UPE did not meet the definition of labor organization by the time it was certified in 2009 and failed to meet the definition until it was "too late[.]" However, nothing in the wording of &#x00A7; 2422.8(d) or Authority precedent indicates that, in the context of an election petition where the unit employees are currently represented, the Petitioner may challenge the status of an incumbent exclusive representative on the basis that it did not constitute a labor organization as of the date on which it was certified by the Authority. <span class="Italic">Cf. Def. Logistics Agency</span>, 5 FLRA 126, 127 (1981) (Authority adopted judge's conclusion that the certification of exclusive representative could not be collaterally attacked). In addition, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(4) and the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs </span>do not require that newly formed organizations must actually have collected dues money no later than the date of certification, or within any specific period of time thereafter, in order to qualify as a labor organization. Thus, the Petitioner's arguments provide no basis for finding that the RD erred in concluding that UPE is a labor organization and has a right under &#x00A7; 2422.8(d) to participate in any election. Accordingly, we deny the application.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In connection with the Petitioner's claim that UPE is being investigated by the Department of Labor, the Authority has repeatedly acknowledged that the Assistant Secretary of Labor has exclusive jurisdiction over the type of claims raised by the Petitioner when they "do not fall under the purview of the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">N.M. Army &#x0026; Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 56 FLRA 145, 149 (2000) (then-Member Segal and then-Member Cabaniss concurring and Chairman Wasserman dissenting as to other matters). Here, the Petitioner makes no argument that the alleged matters are within the purview of the Statute. To the extent that the Petitioner is challenging UPE's certification on grounds other than UPE's failure to meet the definition of "labor organization[,]" the Petitioner may not raise any issue in its application that it did not raise to the RD. It is not clear that the Petitioner raised any challenge to the validity of the Authority's certification to the RD apart from whether UPE met the definition of labor organization.</p>
