<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-142"><span class="space">e.</span> Duress; Misrepresentation; Incompetence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's decision to withdraw an appeal is not binding if it is under duress. If there is an element of duress, it should be raised when the appeal is withdrawn by lodging a protest with the AJ. The facts constituting the duress will not be considered new and material evidence. <span class="Italic">Reebie v. Marine Corps</span>, 23 MSPR 502, 503 (1984) (Board reopened on its own motion, in the interest of the integrity of the appeal process: "If appellant's allegations that he was coerced into withdrawing his appeal are valid, such action by the agency would subvert the appeal process and cannot be condoned or permitted by the Board."). [Refer earlier to "Threats by Agency Personnel."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Displeasure with agency actions not constituting coercion or deceit does not provide a basis for negating an earlier, unequivocal withdrawal of an appeal. An appellant's uncertainty over whether to proceed with an appeal, before the issuance of an initial decision and after the filing of a withdrawal of an appeal, does not establish a basis for setting aside the withdrawal of the appeal after the initial decision is issued. <span class="Italic">Tozier v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 41 MSPR 167, 169 (1989) ("His allegation that he was coerced into retiring goes to the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over his initial appeal and does not relate to whether the withdrawal of his appeal was coerced."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Heiskell v. USPS,</span> DA-0353-10-0434-I-1 (NP 5/12/2011) ("The appellant asserts that she and her representative decided that it was in her best interest to move for withdrawal so that she could pursue her grievance of the matter, but now she "declines the offer" to withdraw her appeal without prejudice and seeks to proceed to a hearing. However, the mere fact that the appellant has changed her mind and now wishes to proceed with her Board appeal does not form a basis for reversing the administrative judge's dismissal of the appeal as withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See Lincoln</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 486, &#x00B6; 8.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determines voluntariness if the appellant alleges that she was forced or misled into withdrawing her appeal. <span class="Italic">Doyle v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1991), apparently permitted allegations concerning the voluntariness of the withdrawal to be raised for the first time in the PFR (producing a result consistent with the nature of the allegation that a withdrawal, quickly accepted by the AJ, was coerced):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally gives effect to an appellant's withdrawal of her appeal and, absent unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, we will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn....&#8197;The appellant here alleges that...the agency's representative during the proceedings below induced her into withdrawing her appeal by means of misinformation and duress. The alleged improprieties...include the following: Purposefully bypassing the appellant's designated representatives in order to deal directly with the appellant, thereby taking advantage of her "lack of sophistication"; intentionally misrepresenting material facts; and intimidating the appellant with respect to her suspension and the withdrawal of her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the appellant asserts that, on February 13, 1991, [the agency representative] issued her "an ultimatum" stating that, "unless she unilaterally withdrew her appeal by 5:00 <small>P.M.</small> that day, she would 'lose everything.'" The appellant further asserts in this regard that the short timeframe imposed...made it impossible for the appellant to contact her attorney prior to the 5:00 <small>P.M.</small> deadline. The Board will not countenance such actions by the agency's representative where they are taken with the intent to avoid dealing with the appellant's duly-designated representative....&#8197;We find that the appellant's allegations raise substantial factual questions as to the voluntariness of the withdrawal of her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find it appropriate to remand this appeal to the regional office for a hearing on the appellant's allegations and to determine whether the withdrawal of her appeal was voluntary....&#8197;If the administrative judge finds that the appellant's withdrawal was involuntary, she shall reinstate the appeal and adjudicate it on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reliance on an agency's misrepresentations may warrant reopening of an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. OPM</span>, 90 MSPR 611, 613-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-7 (2002) (appellant withdrew an appeal based on a representation by OPM that employee's annuity would be adjusted; when it was not, the Board reinstated the appeal despite the lapse of the PFR deadline). An appeal was reinstated after it was withdrawn based on OPM's representations concerning the amount of annuity the appellant would receive without the necessity of pursuing the Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Mueller v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 639, 640-41 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a reconsideration decision denying the appellant's application for disability retirement benefits. The appellant filed a timely appeal, and during a telephonic conference on July 23, 1997, the appellant withdrew her appeal based on OPM's representative's calculations that she would receive $725.15 per month, premised on the appellant's early-out retirement, which would be higher than a disability retirement annuity of $591.15 per month. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petition for review, the appellant asserts that she withdrew her appeal based on the accuracy of OPM's representative's statement that her disability retirement annuity would be "$550.00 [sic] a month." The appellant further states that, subsequent to the July 23, 1997 telephonic conference, "Ms. Coleman from the Washington office" told her in a telephone conversation that her disability retirement annuity "should be $775.00 a month." The appellant therefore concludes that she was given inaccurate information by OPM's representative that induced her to withdraw her appeal, and she wishes to reinstate her appeal. OPM has not responded to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality, and, in the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it is withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 474, 477 (1996); <span class="Italic">Scarboro v. Department of the Navy,</span> 55 MSPR 494, 496 (1992). The Board, however, may relieve the appellant of the consequences of her decision to withdraw the appeal where the decision was based on incorrect or misleading information. <span class="Italic">Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's expressed reason for withdrawing her appeal was her reliance on OPM's representative's stated amount of her monthly <span id="Page_1089"></span>disability retirement annuity, as noted above. If, indeed, OPM made misleading statements regarding such amount, it does not appear that the appellant voluntarily withdrew her appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Gray v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 MSPR 78 (1984) (the Board ruled that the appeal would be reinstated if, as alleged and as appeared from the record, the appellant chose to withdraw his appeal because he had been misinformed by the agency regarding his retirement benefits; the Board remanded the matter for a determination of whether the appellant involuntarily withdrew his appeal); <span class="Italic">cf. also Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment). We find that, under the circumstances of this case and the alleged difference of approximately $200 per month in the amount of disability retirement annuity that the appellant could receive, the parties should be afforded an opportunity to address the issue of alleged inaccurate information provided by OPM concerning the appellant's retirement options.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that OPM is not estopped from denying benefits not permitted by law because of an employee's reliance on erroneous advice. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 2467, 2476-77, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990). That case, however, involved the Appropriations Clause and the authority of the government to pay benefits for which the retiree did not qualify. In this case, however, the alleged misrepresentation goes to the appellant's right of appeal to the Board and the significance of the withdrawal of the appeal, and not to the government's obligation to pay. Thus, the Board may relieve the appellant of the consequences of her decision to withdraw her appeal if she relied on misinformation in choosing to withdraw her appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scarboro,</span> 55 MSPR at 497 n.2.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant withdrew an appeal based on bad information from his agency. He was told that he could file a grievance concerning his employment dispute within 15 days of the Board's disposition of his appeal. Acting on that information, the appellant withdrew his Board appeal, only to find that his attempts to initiate a grievance were barred because the filing deadline had passed. <span class="Italic">McCann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 288, 290-91 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Doyle v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 566, 568-69 (1991)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">James v.

The appeal in <span class="Italic">Stewart v. DHHS</span>, 100 MSPR 661, 663 &#x00B6; 7 (2005), was reinstated when the appellant withdrew the appeal, based on information she supplied with her PFR, involving an agency personnelist's statements to the appellant during a prehearing conference that the appellant's personnel file had no negative information concerning the appellant. The appellant made several attempts during the appellate process to obtain the OPF from the agency. When, after the appeal was dismissed as withdrawn based on the representations by the agency's official, the appellant discovered that the information she was provided was incorrect, she promptly moved to reopen the appeal. The appeal from an indefinite suspension was reinstated on PFR when the appellant asserted that he was promised, but did not receive, leave restoration as an inducement to withdraw his appeal. <span class="Italic">Rose v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gallegos v. FDIC</span>, 90 MSPR 159, 161-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2001), permitted reinstatement of an appeal withdrawn by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant suffering from a mental impairment, whose actions were influenced by unusually stressful hearing conditions as well as by the failure of the AJ to appreciate the appellant's condition and to inform her of the consequences of the withdrawal of her appeal. The Board decided that the situation warranted reassignment of the case to another AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleges that she was mentally impaired at the time of the withdrawal of her appeal due to severe chronic depression and a panic disorder. A medical report in the record before the AJ provided evidentiary support for the appellant's allegation that she suffers from these illnesses. The appellant's physician, Peter A. Sugerman, M.D., and psychotherapist, Joseph A. Horton, Ph.D., stated in the medical report dated June 26, 2000, approximately 3 months prior to the withdrawal of the appeal, that "the appellant has all the symptoms associated with acute stress disorder." The report stated that "she cannot sleep, has recurring nightmares, and feels that she has been ignored, insulted, ridiculed, and physically and mentally assaulted." The report also stated that "she becomes agitated and anxious whenever she has anything to do with the FDIC to the point where her actions become completely aimless." Thus, the evidence of record supports the appellant's allegation that she was mentally impaired at the time of the hearing and that the nature of her condition was such that the proceedings involving the agency would have aggravated her condition<span class="Italic">. Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1998) (an appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status on review, and evidence of some disabling mental condition, are legitimate factors to be considered in deciding whether to exercise the Board's discretionary authority to remand for further findings); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 454 (Board found no merit to employee's claim that she suffered from a stress disorder and stress-related hypertension and that these conditions caused her not to comprehend the implications of her decision to withdraw her appeal because medical documents she submitted were dated 1992 and did not refer to circumstances surrounding her 1996 decision to withdraw her appeal or otherwise reflect how her conditions might have rendered her unable to fully comprehend the nature of the withdrawal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to whether she has otherwise shown that she was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question, the appellant argues that the circumstances surrounding the hearing contributed to her anxiety and inability to understand the implications of her withdrawal of the appeal. She states that the length of the settlement negotiations and hearing reached approximately 14 hours by the end of the first day. She states also that she received a short break at lunch but no breaks later in the evening as the hearing progressed to 10:20 <small>P.M.</small> She states further that she was unable to take medication following the hearing because, due to the late hour, she could not get the 10-12 hours of sleep required to function on the medication the next day of the hearing, and that she was hungry, having missed dinner and then breakfast prior to the hearing. The appellant asserts that on the second day of the hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I immediately requested to speak to the Judge. I told him that I could not continue. He dictated to me a statement to be entered into the record. After he dictated the statement to be entered on the record, he asked me to date and sign it. I dated it June 29, 2000...rather than September 29, 2000...which was entered into the court record. I made a comment to the judge how I was shaking and did not know what Month or Date it was. This should have been adequate proof to the Judge that I was incoherent and unable to properly represent myself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Further, even though the evidence clearly indicates that the lengthiness of the hearing created a level of exhaustion and confusion with the appellant as well as the agency's witness, the record does not show that the AJ, although aware of the appellant's mental condition and anxiety in confronting the FDIC, ever asked the appellant whether she understood the implications of the withdrawal of the appeal. Further, the record does not show that he advised her of the legal consequences of her decision to withdraw the appeal. Thus, we find that the appellant has shown that the circumstances surrounding the hearing contributed to her anxiety and inability to understand the implications of her withdrawal action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scarboro v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 494, 496 (1992); <span class="Italic">Dodd v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 582, 585 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant claims that her decision to withdraw her appeal was influenced by the AJ's failure to correct her erroneous belief that by withdrawing her appeal she withdrew her right to a hearing but maintained her right to appeal the removal. The record does not show that the AJ was aware of the appellant's misapprehension in this regard. The record, however, does indicate that the AJ had an opportunity to advise the appellant at the hearing that the withdrawal of her appeal would forfeit her right of appeal to the Board and he failed to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scarboro,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. at 496 (Board reinstated the appeal where the employee withdrew her appeal based on her erroneous belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction, and, although the administrative judge was in a position, during a conference call, to correct the appellant's mistaken belief, he failed to do so). Moreover, we find that the same considerations that lead us to conclude that the appellant's withdrawal of her appeal <span id="Page_1090"></span>was not a clear, unequivocal, and decisive action, raise a question as to whether the appellant's request to withdraw her request for a hearing was a clear, unequivocal, and decisive action. Because strong policy considerations favor granting an appellant a hearing on the merits of her case, an appellant may waive the right to a hearing only by clear, unequivocal, or decisive action; further, the waiver must be an informed one. <span class="Italic">See Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 148, 150-52 (1998). We find that standard has not been met here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we are compelled to resolve any doubts in the appellant's favor, to reinstate this appeal, and to provide the appellant with another opportunity to request a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Amante v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 MSPR 636, 638 (1998) (the Board reinstated a previously withdrawn appeal based on the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, his prompt letter to the AJ questioning the withdrawal of his appeal, his apparent misunderstanding of the consequences of his withdrawal and the lack of any memorialization in the record of what occurred during his telephone conversation with the AJ when he requested to withdraw his appeal); <span class="Italic">see generally Dodd,</span> 48 MSPR at 585 (the Board reinstated the appeal where the appellant withdrew his appeal based on an apparent belief that his only choice was between a hearing and withdrawal and the AJ failed to advise the appellant that he could have his appeal adjudicated without a hearing although he had the opportunity to do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant an opportunity for a hearing, if she requests one, and shall adjudicate the merits of her appeal.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;...In <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 554, 114 S. Ct. 1147, 127 L. Ed.2d 474, the Supreme Court suggested that reviewing bodies have discretion to require reassignment upon remand even where recusal would not be required. In view of the above and considering the ordeal this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant endured in the proceeding below, the Board, relying on <span class="Italic">Liteky,</span> as cited in <span class="Italic">Chianelli v. Environ</span>mental Protection Agency, 2001 WL 534142 (Fed. Cir. 2001), would reassign this case to another administrative judge on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical and anecdotal evidence did not warrant reinstatement of an appeal by an appellant who withdrew his appeal, <span class="Italic">Auyong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 97 MSPR 267, 269-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-9 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Withdrawal of an appeal is generally an act of finality that has the effect of removing the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction, and, absent unusual circumstances, the Board will not reinstate an appeal merely because the appellant has had a change of mind and now wants to proceed before the Board. <span class="Italic">Gallegos v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 159 &#x00B6; 4 (2001). The Board may relieve the appellant of the consequences of his decision to withdraw the appeal, however, when he shows that the withdrawal was involuntary because of mental distress. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining if reinstatement of the appeal is warranted, the Board considers whether the appellant was represented below, has demonstrated that he was mentally impaired at the time, and has otherwise shown that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question or to assist his representative in regard to the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his declaration in support of his request to reinstate his appeal, the appellant states that he has been intermittently under the care of Psychiatrist Mark Zen, M.D., since 1991. Dr. Zen diagnosed the appellant with "Major Depression and psychosis (borderline paranoid ideation)" and treated him with a regimen of psychotherapy and antipsychotic and antidepressant medications. At the time relevant to the withdrawal of the appeal, the appellant and his wife were experiencing severe marital problems. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. They were seeing a marital counselor and the appellant was attempting to reconcile with his wife. In June 2003, he was depressed, nervous, and upset about keeping the marriage together. He did not return to Dr. Zen, however, because his mental disorder "prevented [him] from making cogent and rational decisions...." He also feared that seeking treatment would cause further deterioration in his marriage. After he filed his appeal, he began to believe that pursuing his appeal would result in his wife leaving him and taking their child with her. He believed that the public nature of the appeal would humiliate her. Rather than risk this additional stress to their marriage, which was deteriorating in any case, he decided to withdraw the appeal. He called his attorney on the evening of June 13 and left a telephone message instructing him to withdraw the appeal. He avoided contact with his attorney because he believed that the representative would try to convince him not to withdraw the appeal. Early in July, his wife told him that she was filing for divorce. After he decided in mid-July that there was no chance to save his marriage, he called his attorney to seek to reinstate his appeal. His representative's declaration corroborates the appellant's description of their interaction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also submitted a report from Psychologist Robert Dav&#x00E9;, Ph.D., who conducted a psychological evaluation on the appellant on September 11, 2003. Dr. Dav&#x00E9; had also assessed the appellant's mental status on April 4 and 17, 2003. According to Dr. Dav&#x00E9;, the appellant returned to Dr. Zen after the incident that led to his removal. Dr. Zen prescribed Remeron, which the appellant took until February 2003, when it was discontinued. By April 2003, the appellant's clinical depression and marital crisis seemed to have resolved and he was psychologically stable. However, some time after he received the May 5, 2003 removal decision, his wife made it clear that she would not tolerate the stress of an appeal, and she refused to return to the marriage counselor who had ended treatment. Dr. Dav&#x00E9; stated that the appellant believed that continuing the appeal would end his marriage. In Dr. Dav&#x00E9;'s opinion, the appellant would not have withdrawn his appeal but for his major depression, underlying marital stressors, his wife's ultimatum, and his personality traits, which make him vulnerable to relationship instability and dependency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's evidence is insufficient to show that his decision to withdraw the appeal was the result of his mental condition and not a choice freely made. His evidence shows that he suffers from a mental illness, but he has not shown that he was unable to understand fully the nature of the action in question. In his declaration, he states that, after his removal was effected on May 12, 2003, he retained his attorney to represent him in his appeal. He signed the appeal form on June 2, and it was filed on June 10, 2003. According to his declaration, the appellant left a telephone message on June 13 with his attorney, instructing him to withdraw the appeal. The appellant's general statements about his mental condition from January 2003 and through June 24, the date he signed the letter withdrawing the appeal, do not explain how he was able to exercise the judgment to contact an attorney and file an appeal in the first place, but then, only a short time later, lack the judgment to leave his appeal in place. He has not described any particular incident between June 2 and June 13, 2003, that would have affected his judgment. Although he asserts that he believed that pursuing his appeal would result in the ending of his marriage, his sworn statement indicates that the same circumstances were present when he filed the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Dav&#x00E9;'s opinion is based on a psychological evaluation conducted on September 11, 2003, and his review of his earlier April 4 and April 17, 2003 assessment reports, along with underlying documents and records, and his review of the appellant's October 23 declaration. Dr. Dav&#x00E9; does not state that he saw the appellant during June and July 2003. Nor does he explain how the appellant had the mental and emotional ability to file a timely appeal but then apparently lost that same judgment when he withdrew his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that the evidence that the appellant presents does not warrant relieving him of the consequences of his decision to withdraw the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 451, 454 (1996) (Board found no merit in <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's claim that her stress disorder and stress-related hypertension caused her not to comprehend the implications of her decision to withdraw her appeal because medical documents that she submitted were dated 1992 and did not refer to circumstances surrounding her 1996 decision to withdraw her appeal or otherwise reflect how her conditions might have rendered her unable to fully comprehend the nature of her withdrawal).
