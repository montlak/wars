<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-89"><span class="space">2.</span> Requirement for Adverse Action Procedure</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In a straightforward enforced leave case (the agency places the employee into leave status based on a proposed adverse action, provides a reply opportunity, and issues a decision), the ensuing appeal is treated as what it is: an adverse action suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Abbott v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ABBOTT_MARY_A_DC_0752_12_0366_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1048487.pdf">121 MSPR 294</a>, 2014 MSPB 47 (2014) (discussed earlier, in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-083.html#sec6-83">Enforced Leave; Constructive Suspension</a>"). For other situations, the analysis is less pellucid; the adverse action analysis has varied over time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there was some authority from the Court of Claims suggesting that noticeless enforced leave was improper in a disciplinary context, e.g., <span class="Italic">Hart v. United States</span>, 284 F.2d 682 (Ct. Cl. 1960), a result that was also reached in <span class="Italic">Pulley v. DHHS</span>, 14 MSPR 121, 124-25 (1982) (placement of an employee on enforced leave following a threat to a supervisor was disciplinary in nature and should have followed the adverse action notice and reply rights), following the 1978 Reform Act, the analysis of whether agencies must use adverse action procedures to impose enforced leave was principally controlled by three decisions of the Federal Circuit involving the imposition of enforced leave in situations not squarely involving disciplinary situations: <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, and <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985), was decided with reference to the OPM regulation that restricted the use of enforced leave when agencies had reason to initiate psychiatric disability retirement proceedings on behalf of or against an employee. <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 772 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985), considered the use of enforced leave pending the outcome of a psychiatric fitness exam that could have been the predicate for the initiation of a psychiatric disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987), broadened the application of the first two decisions to encompass virtually any use of enforced leave. Enforced leave adverse action procedures are for nonprobationary employees. Enforced leave involving a probationer is not within the Board's adverse action appellate authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowmack v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 491, 498 &#x00B6; 18 (1999). In the unusual case of conversion of paid duty time of an ALJ to LWOP, the ensuing constructive suspension appeal is heard by an ALJ as a disciplinary case against the ALJ under 5 USC 7521. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jennings v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/JENNINGS_KELLY_STEPHEN_AT_4324_11_0442_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1336286.pdf">123 MSPR 577</a>, 2016 MSPB 31 (2016).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The changes in enforced leave law began with agency application of an OPM regulation, 5 CFR 831.1206, no longer extant. The regulation recited that an agency should retain an employee in active duty status until it received the initial decision of OPM on an agency-initiated application for retirement necessitated by mental disability, but the agency could place the appellant on leave without his consent if his retention in active duty could result in damage to government property or could be detrimental to the interests of the government or injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the general public. <span class="Italic">Goldsborough v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 521, 523 n.1, 6 MSPB 437 (1981). The regulatory scheme no longer permits the agency to initiate disability retirement except under very limited circumstances, and then only upon removal of the employee. 5 CFR 831.1201 (2022), <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Under the earlier regulations, agencies were placing employees considered too disruptive or unproductive to retain on the payroll on enforced leave during the time required to process their retirement applications.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the appeal that would change the law during court review, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 20 MSPR 688 (1984), the Board determined that the OPM regulation permitted the agency to place an employee on noticeless enforced leave if an agency-initiated application for retirement was pending with OPM and if the employee appeared to be a threat to coworkers because of bizarre and threatening behavior. The appellant said that there would be a revolution, that he would be the leader, and that the victims would include supervisors. The Board concluded on the basis of this and other evidence that the appellant was a "disruptive, threatening force in the workplace and that his behavior was frightening to his co-workers." The enforced leave status was appropriate and, accordingly, there was no adverse action appellate jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 20 MSPR 688, 695 (1984). Another example of the use of enforced leave for an unruly employee, <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 115, 120 (1982), and 30 MSPR 119, 128 n.8 (1986), suggested that the regulatory conditions for enforced leave were met if the employee had conflicts with other workers, had threatening conversations with personnel, misused leave, and failed to perform work. In a different appeal, an employee with a mental disability was not overly disruptive, but he was considered by the agency to be extremely inefficient. He could not do his job and ended up wasting the time of other employees. The Board found that if an individual could not perform because of mental disability, the provisions of Chapter 43 relating to unacceptable performance actions were inapplicable; the individual was properly placed on enforced leave beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 26 MSPR 640, 643 (1985) (following remand from 21 MSPR 290 (1984). <span class="Italic">Woodall</span> would later be reversed, following the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> court case, <span class="Italic">post</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 196 (1985), and 33 MSPR 127, 134 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis of the enforced leave and constructive suspensions controlled until the matter was placed into the courts. In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 88-90 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the court noted that Mr. Thomas was placed on enforced (sick) leave for about five months before his suspension was proposed for his office behavior and its adverse impact on other employees. GSA then applied for disability on Thomas's behalf and advised him that he was on indefinite suspension pending OPM review of the application. To determine whether enforced leave constituted a suspension, the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> court first reviewed the legislative history of the Reform Act and found nothing more than references to Civil Service Commission determinations on leave issues. The Commission defined a suspension as "an action placing an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for disciplinary reasons or for other reasons pending inquiry." The court determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that GSA's action in this case falls within the jurisdiction of the MSPB, whether that action be deemed taken for purely disciplinary motives (in the sense of punishment) <span class="Italic">or</span> whether it was taken because it was necessary in order to place petitioner apart from his fellow workers during the period until the disability application could be acted upon by OPM. If the agency suspended petitioner simply because of his objective conduct--without regard to the possible source of that conduct in some psychiatric condition--the suspension plainly had a disciplinary basis....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if, as the Board thought and appears probable, the suspension occurred because of Thomas' psychiatric problems as disclosed by the psychiatrist's fitness-for-duty report, this appeal to the MSPB was still proper because the suspension was to await the OPM decision as to the disability application. An OPM regulation, 5 CFR 831.1206 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall retain an employee in an active duty status until it receives the initial decision...on an agency application for disability retirement, except that the agency on the basis of medical evidence, may place an employee on leave with his/her consent, <span class="Italic">or without his/her consent when the circumstances are such that his/her retention in an active duty status may result in damage to Government property, or may be detrimental to the interest of the Government, or injurious to the employee, his/her fellow workers, or the general public</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then is...whether such a "non-disciplinary" suspension...is appealable to the MSPB under the Reform Act.... [T]he legislative history indicates that Congress wished to continue the practice of the former Civil Service Commission, and that Commission had specifically defined <span id="Page_2064"></span>a "suspension" as including the placing of an employee in a temporary non-duty and non-pay status "for disciplinary reasons <span class="Italic">or for other reasons pending inquiry</span>." The latter standard squarely covers the type of involuntary suspension envisaged for disability retirement cases.... Such suspensions--which are ordered because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could...be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public--are "disciplinary" in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government against possible disruption by the suspended employee....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is hard to believe that this regulation intended to permit a prolonged suspension (i.e., of more than 14 days) to be left wholly to the agency's own judgment even though a comparable suspension of purely "disciplinary" character (in the strict sense) would clearly be appealable. The actual impact on the employee would be the same, and there would be no adequate reason for distinguishing between the two (on the question of appealability).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was percolating, <span class="Italic">Woodall</span> had his hearing on remand, but the AJ determined that Woodall was properly placed on enforced leave and that, as a result, the Board lacked jurisdiction over his appeal. The appeal went back to the Board on a PFR. Woodall won, eventually. At first, the Board sustained the initial decision, but the Board then reopened the case after it was brought to the Board's attention that the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> decision required the Board to accept jurisdiction. The agency sought to defend its position by arguing that under then-prevailing OPM regulations, Woodall's retention in active duty status would have been injurious to himself and detrimental to the government's interests. The Board directed a remedy, <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 196 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the agency's assertion that the action meets the above exception to the general rule of 5 CFR 831.1206, the agency failed to provide appellant with any of the adverse action procedural protections required by 5 USC 7513(b) in effecting the suspension in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 363, 369 (1983); <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 5 MSPB 299 (1981). In this regard, the record establishes that while the agency afforded appellant an opportunity to respond to its notice of intent to file a disability retirement application, it did not provide the statutory notice of or opportunity to respond to its decision to place appellant in enforced leave status. Instead, the agency merely informed appellant...that he would be placed in enforced leave status from the following day until OPM's final decision on his retirement application. Since the agency did not afford appellant the procedural protections of 5 USC 7513(b), the action cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was followed by <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">rev'g</span> 24 MSPR 368 (1984), involving an employee accused of threatening conduct. The agency did not initiate a disability retirement application. The employee received a notice of suspension and reacted in a manner that caused his agency to then place him on noticeless enforced leave for the period that it took to have the employee examined by a psychiatrist and for a period following the psychiatrist's report to the agency that the employee was fit for duty. Without reaching the effect of the lack of notice of the enforced leave, the court permitted the first and disallowed the second portion of the enforced leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the Board had jurisdiction we, nevertheless, need not remand for a determination whether the suspension was proper. The findings and conclusions of the presiding official that "the agency had an obligation to send appellant for a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination" and that "appellant's conduct and medical condition gave the agency a reasonable belief that he presented a threat to his fellow employees" are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and, therefore, remain undisturbed.... Accordingly, Mercer's non-duty status from December 7, 1981, to February 11, 1982 (the date the Board found that the agency received notice that Mercer was able to work), constituted a proper suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the remaining period of enforced leave, the Board found that any delay from February 11, 1982, to February 19, 1982, was proper being attributable to the normal administrative process and that the delay thereafter constituted improper enforced leave. We hold that once an agency learns that its beliefs are unfounded, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the employee is fit for duty, the employee must be restored immediately to "active duty status." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 831.1206; <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPB 348 (1982) (after acquittal of employee suspended on reasonable belief he had committed a crime, agency ordered to terminate suspension as of the date the agency was notified of the acquittal). Accordingly, Mercer's non-duty, non-pay status from February 11, 1982, until March 1, 1982, constituted an improper suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the issue of readiness to work, the Board adopted the requirement that an employee be immediately restored to active duty status after the agency learns that he is fit for duty. <span class="Italic">Patin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 3, 5 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board accepted the analysis and results of <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, reviewing both decisions in <span class="Italic">Passmore v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 31 MSPR 65, 67-70 (1986)<span class="Italic">.</span> In <span class="Italic">Passmore,</span> the appellant was placed on enforced leave pending psychiatric evaluation. After the evaluation, he was told that he was permanently disqualified for air traffic control duties. He appealed the enforced leave as an improper suspension. The Board reversed the enforced leave for failure of the agency to provide the procedural protections of 5 USC 7513(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant is placed on enforced leave pending inquiry or because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could be injurious to the employee, his or her fellow workers, or the public, the appellant need not show that he or she is ready, willing and able to work during the period of leave in order to bring the agency action within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>...the Federal Circuit focused on the disciplinary prong of the <span class="Italic">Martel</span> test and concluded that the ready, willing and able test does not apply to certain situations....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The court concluded that two types of enforced leave are within the Board's jurisdiction: (1) where the action is for purely disciplinary motives; and (2) where the action is taken to keep appellant away from the workplace pending inquiry, including an OPM determination on a disability retirement application. With respect to the first situation, the court found that enforced leave based upon conduct, such as inappropriate, disruptive or threatening behavior, may fall within the normal meaning of discipline and, therefore, come within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the second situation, the court found that under 5 CFR 831.1206 (1983), enforced leave ordered because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in danger to federal property, or be detrimental to governmental interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public, is "disciplinary" in the sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government against possible disruption by the suspended employee pending OPM's determination of that employee's disability application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently, the court expanded its holding in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> on the ready, willing, and able test to a case which did not involve a disability retirement application. In <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the appellant was placed on enforced leave pending a fitness-for-duty examination after verbally threatening his supervisor. The court found that enforced leave ordered because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public is "disciplinary" in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government against possible disruption by the suspended employee.... Thus, the court has established that where the enforced leave is ordered pending inquiry or where retention on duty status would be injurious to the employee, his or her fellow workers, or the public, the enforced leave constitutes an appealable suspension regardless of whether the appellant is ready, willing, and able to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Passmore</span> was followed in another appeal involving noticeless enforced leave against an air traffic controller believed to be suffering a temporary psychological problem. The Board declined to dismiss the case as moot when the enforced leave ended before disposition of the appeal. The possibility of back pay could, in the Board's judgment, constitute an improper suspension, warranting retention of the appeal and denial of a motion to dismiss. <span class="Italic">Valentine v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 31 MSPR 358, 360 n.1 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Seman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 294, 296 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Passmore</span>, reexamining <span class="Italic">Mosely</span>, "held that when an employee is placed on enforced leave pending inquiry or because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public, the employee need not show--in order to establish Board jurisdiction--that he is ready, willing, and able to work during the period of leave"); <span class="Italic">Pifer v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 395, 397 (1986) (reversal of a noticeless enforced leave was ordered because of the perceived threat of the employee's presence and a pending medical inquiry to evaluate the employee's suitability for work); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 42 MSPR 115, 121 (1989) (on a counsel fee application); <span class="Italic">Lynch v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 33, 39 (1986) (restating <span class="Italic">Passmore</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions just discussed concerned enforced leave imposed with agency-initiated disability retirement applications or psychiatric fitness exams for employees with a mental disability. There remained the question of the legitimacy of use of noticeless enforced leave when an agency decided that an employee had a medical condition making it unsafe for him to work or unsafe for others working around him. The Board attempted to distinguish the use of enforced leave for an individual with a medical problem from its use for employees with psychiatric difficulties. <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 33 MSPR 67, 70-73 (1987), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>, permitted the use of enforced leave for employees with general medical problems unless the employees could prove that they were ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Orr</span>, 747 F.2d 1352 (10th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Schoening v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 34 MSPR 556, 560 (1987) ("In fact, the agency did not have much discretion in placing appellant in an enforced leave status since it was appellant's physician who found him physically unable to perform his job. In <span id="Page_2065"></span>light of this medical information, the agency would have been in violation of appellant's physician's instructions if it had allowed appellant to return to work."); <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 97, 100 (1987) (employee was placed on enforced leave because of a physical inability to perform work when light duty assignments were unavailable); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Maucier v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 101, 103 (1987) (same result as <span class="Italic">Morey</span>). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 15 (1986) (reversing leave imposed when the appellant would not release medical records to the agency); <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 485, 488 (1986) (reversing a noticeless enforced leave caused by an employee's inability to wear safety equipment without medical problems); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Zaborowski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 299, 302-03 &#x0026; n.3 (1987) (Board implied that enforced leave was used in a disciplinary situation to remove from the worksite an employee who had complained that other employees were shirking their duties).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> analysis collapsed during Federal Circuit review. In <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the court summarized the events leading to the appeal: as a result of back problems, Mr. Pittman was placed in a light duty position, then placed on enforced leave when the agency determined it could no longer maintain him on light duty and could find no other position for him. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, distinguishing between psychological and physical problems. The court decided the distinction was unavailing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two of our earlier decisions give us helpful guidance in the current case. The first was <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>...and the second was <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>.... <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> expressly held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Such suspensions--which are ordered because the agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to federal property, or be detrimental to governmental interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public--are "disciplinary" in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government against possible disruption by the suspended employee (pending the determination of that employee's disability retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Mercer</span>...repeated this rule and held that part of that employee's suspension "constituted an improper suspension."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board's opinion in the current case distinguished cases with psychological overtones (in which <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> would apply) from those showing purely physical symptoms (like Pittman's) which would still be beyond MSPB jurisdiction. We see no reason in the statute, legislative history, or regulation for this difference. The effect on the Government's operations as well as on the employee's own interests is the same. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> are framed in general principles making no such psychological-physical distinction. As <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> has already indicated...it is hard to believe that the law limits a prolonged suspension (i.e., of more than 14 days) wholly to the agency's own judgment in physical cases while psychological instances would clearly be appealable to the Board. "The actual impact on the employee would be the same, and there would be no adequate reason for distinguishing between the two (on the question of appealability)." In both instances, indefinite enforced leave is tantamount to depriving the worker of his job--without any review other than by the agency--until the agency itself changes its mind and decides that he can perform his job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> that the placement on enforced leave be "pending inquiry"...is fulfilled here by the demand that the agency continue to monitor Pittman to see whether he has become able to work. "[O]nce an agency learns that its beliefs are unfounded, i.e., that the employee is fit for duty, the employee must be restored immediately to "active duty status." <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>. The result is that the present case falls directly under <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> in all respects.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency follows statutory adverse action procedures, it may impose leave. Proper procedures were employed in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 21, 26 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, in so suspending the appellant, the agency provided the requisite statutory procedures of 5 USC 7513(b). Moreover, the administrative judge found that the appellant conceded, on appeal, that he could not perform the duties of his Letter Carrier position, due to his medical restrictions. The appellant established no right to placement in a light-duty assignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, at 460 (denial of a request for light-duty placement is within the discretion of the agency). The administrative judge found that the agency proved that it did not have available work that was within the appellant's medical limitations.... Based upon all of the above findings, we conclude that the agency's action was procedurally correct, and that the agency supported its basis for the action by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B). In <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> at 600, the court sanctioned an agency's suspension of an employee "pending inquiry" into his ability to work, so long as requisite procedures had been followed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What all this means is that enforced leave is to be applied through adverse action procedures if the leave exceeds 14 days and if it is imposed for reasons of alleged physical or mental disability. <span class="Italic">Morrison v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 479, 482 (1988) (restrictions were placed on an employee by his personal physician and agency doctors); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Justice v.

USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 98, 103 (1997) (enforced leave of more than 14 days is a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction when action is taken pending an agency inquiry into the employee's physical ability to perform; the agency's restoration of the employee to administrative leave status does not moot appeal); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 665, 670-71 (1992) (agency must treat as a suspension the placement of an employee on enforced leave because the agency has determined, or is inquiring into, whether his physical condition renders him incapable of performing the duties of the position; the suspension will be reversed unless there has been prior notice of the charges, an explanation of agency evidence, and an opportunity to respond, i.e., constitutional due process); <span class="Italic">McClain v.

<p class="Body-Text">If an agency places an employee on enforced leave through adverse action procedures, the leave is within the jurisdiction of the Board once the leave exceeds 14 days, and jurisdiction does not depend on whether the employee is able to work or whether the leave is paid, <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 70 MSPR 483, 486 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded that, although the appellant's placement on enforced leave was involuntary, it could not be appealed because he was not ready, willing, and able to work in his position, the agency had no suitable light duty, and the action was not meant to be discipline for misconduct. The administrative judge's analysis is consistent with <span class="Italic">Mosely v. Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 220, 4 MSPR 135, 137 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 718 (1981), upon which he relied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Mosely</span> has never been expressly overruled, its test for when placement on enforced leave may be appealed is no longer the law. Specifically, jurisdiction over an appeal from enforced leave does not depend on whether the employee was ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">See Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 284, 286-87 (1991). Furthermore, whether there is work available within any medical restrictions an employee may be under has no bearing on jurisdiction over an appeal from the employee's placement on enforced leave. <span class="Italic">See Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 121, 126 (1994). Finally, enforced leave based not on alleged misconduct, but on the agency's belief that an employee cannot perform his duties without endangering himself or others, is nevertheless "'disciplinary' in the broader sense of maintaining the orderly working of the Government...." <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (quoting <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 89 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985)). For jurisdictional purposes, the key question is whether the agency or the employee initiated the leave; the involuntary placement of an employee on leave for more than 14 days, pending an inquiry into the employee's ability to work, is an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Rivas,</span> 61 MSPR at 126-27; <span class="Italic">accord Moon v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Although <span class="Italic">Walker</span> evidently involved enforced unpaid leave, whether or not the leave is paid makes no difference for jurisdictional purposes. <span class="Italic">See Minnis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2066"></span>In the present case, the agency conceded below that the appellant was placed on leave "without his consent." Additionally, according to the agency, the appellant was not serving a probationary period and had more than one year of current continuous service in a competitive-service position at the time of the action.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Stewart v.
