<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-62"><span class="space">3.</span> Investigation Reports</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Many agency cases based on misconduct allegations rely on an investigation report that finds its way into the appeals response or hearing record. The weight of the report is based on the circumstances of its compilation and presentation as evidence. Because both parties offer evidence <span class="Italic">de novo</span> in a Board hearing, an investigative report is admissible, although an agency may choose not to rely upon it when it issues charges against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Skrettas v. VA</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP) ("But there is nothing that generally forbids an agency from relying on reliable hearsay, including to discipline employees based on misconduct reports relayed to supervisors. <span class="Italic">See</span> Charles H. Koch, 2 <span class="Italic">Administrative Law and Practice</span> &#x00A7; 5:52[4] (3d ed. 2023)."); <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 80 n.6 (1994) ("[A]lthough the report contains a detailed description of these statements. Because the IG report did not include the witnesses' statements, the administrative judge attached little probative value to it. We find that the absence of the witnesses' statements, standing alone, does not detract from the report's probative value."); <span class="Italic">Marable v. Dept. of Army</span>, 52 MSPR 622, 626 (1992) ("It was also not improper for the administrative judge to accept the AFOSI report into evidence even though the report constitutes hearsay evidence.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The probative value of a hearsay report of investigation may be lessened if the investigator was not at the hearing and available for cross-examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 659, 664 (1984) ("[T]he unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct contained in the NIS reports and statements, when measured against appellant's sworn testimony, which is uncontradicted and corroborated, are deserving of little weight[.] "); <span class="Italic">Pardo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 206, 210 (1982) (without other evidence corroborating the agency's case, the appellant's sworn testimony outweighed the statement of the investigator who was not made available for cross-examination).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The value of a report may be diminished if a principal witness does no more than affirm before the Board the correctness of his statement to the investigator, assuming reliable contradiction by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 92, 95 (1991). The report may assume less prominence if it is compiled by an interested agency and involves delicate and complex matters pertaining to an individual's constitutional rights against the government, especially where fact-finding procedures were inadequate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Porter v. Califano</span>, 592 F.2d 770 (5th Cir. 1979). Investigative memoranda may diminish in evidentiary value if they are written many months after the interviews they reflect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS</span>, 318 F.3d 1310, 1316 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woodward v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 389, 394-99 (1997), involving an appeal from a negative OPM suitability determination, comprehensively discussed how the Board weighs investigative reports that are contradicted by the appellant's sworn testimony:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The two investigative reports, which are composed largely of hearsay evidence, were properly admitted into evidence under well-settled law that relevant hearsay evidence is admissible in administrative hearings. <span class="Italic">Marable v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 52 MSPR 622, 626 (1992); <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 258 (1988); <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77, 83-87 (1981). Hearsay evidence may meet the "substantial" evidence standard which requires evidence only of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded persons in exercising impartial judgment might reach different conclusions. 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(p)]. It may not, however, have sufficient probative value or weight to meet the higher standard of "preponderant" evidence required of OPM in this case. 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B). Preponderant evidence is defined as evidence that a reasonable person would accept as sufficient to find a contested fact more probably true than untrue. 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)]; <span class="Italic">Tamburello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 455, 466 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, under <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>, to the extent that an agency relies on hearsay evidence to support its action, the administrative judge must first determine whether such evidence has significant probative value according to the circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 558,[5] 65 (1991). If so, the administrative judge must then determine whether the value of that hearsay evidence is outweighed by the other evidence of record, including the appellant's oral testimony. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 7 MSPB 746, 8 MSPR 289, 294 (1981). The administrative judge in this case relied heavily on the investigative reports, but failed to assess their probative value, even though the appellant argued the issue before him. <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, 48 MSPR at 565. We correct that error now. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR at 88; <span class="Italic">cf. Garst v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 378 (1993) (while an administrative judge's credibility determinations are entitled to deference, the Board may substitute its own findings, giving the administrative judge's determinations only so much weight as may be warranted by the record and the strength of his reasoning).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following judicial precedents examining the weight to be given hearsay evidence, particularly documentary evidence such as an administrative record, the Board in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> set forth the following factors which are to be considered in assessing the probative value of hearsay evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;whether the statements of the out-of-court declarants were signed or in affidavit form, and whether anyone witnessed the signing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;the agency's explanation for failing to obtain signed or sworn statements;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;whether declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events, and whether the statements were routinely made;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;consistency of declarants' accounts with other information in the case, internal consistency, and their consistency with each other;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;whether corroboration for statements can otherwise be found in the agency record;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;the absence of contradictory evidence; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;credibility of declarant when he made the statement attributed to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR at 87.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On their face, the reports which form the entire basis of the agency's case against the appellant present issues of reliability. Much of them are, at best, double hearsay. The names of the investigators are not provided <span id="Page_1489"></span>and the reports contain no sworn statements, in fact, no statements at all, of witnesses who were questioned, but only summaries of their statements as prepared by the unidentified investigators<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Henley v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 379 F. Supp. 1044, 1054 (M.D. Pa. 1974); <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 7 MSPB 746, 8 MSPR at 295. As such, the declarants have not signified the accuracy of the summaries or the truth of the statements attributed to them. The agency has offered no explanation as to why it did not obtain signed statements. <span class="Italic">Futrell v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 57 MSPR 640, 644-45 (1993), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 31 F.3d 1177 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Moreover, as noted, the agency did not produce any witnesses at the hearing, neither the individuals with firsthand knowledge who spoke to the investigators nor the investigators themselves. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. United States</span>, 226 Ct. Cl. 75, 639 F.2d 727, 730 (1980); <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 7 MSPB 746, 8 MSPR at 296, n.4. And, the agency provided no explanation for its failure to do so<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Although the summaries upon which the agency relied were, in part, consistent with one another, the individuals with whom the investigators spoke were involved to some extent in the incidents and cannot be considered disinterested. <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR at 89. Moreover, the "statements" were not routinely made. As such, these summaries of conversations do not rise to a probative value sufficient to resolve the factual disputes relating to the alleged incidents of misconduct and job terminations favorably to the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf. Morris v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 619, 623 (1987) (where OPM's evidence was presented in the form of signed statements that were internally consistent, consistent with other statements taken during the investigation, and supported by contemporaneously-maintained records, the administrative judge properly concluded that such evidence outweighed the appellant's oral testimony).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The way in which the Board assesses the probative value of investigative reports under <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> is consistent with that prescribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. Although the Board is not required to strictly adhere to the Federal Rules of Evidence, <span class="Italic">see Behensky v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 MSPR 690, 696 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Brandis v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 795 F.2d 1012 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 1006, 107 S. Ct. 644, 93 L. Ed.2d 700 (1986), they may be looked to for guidance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>, <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 33, 42 (1986). The Federal Rules provide that "Public records and reports" are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Pursuant to Rule 803(8), these consist of:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">records, reports, statements, or data, compilations, in any form, of public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding, however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers or other law enforcement personnel, or (C) in civil actions and proceedings and against the Government in criminal cases, factual findings resulting from an investigation made pursuant to authority granted by law, unless the sources of the information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to its drafters, Rule 803(8) is based on "the assumption that a public official will perform his duty properly and the unlikelihood that he will remember details independently of the record." Rule 803(8) Advisory Committee's note. Thus, in considering whether an official report should be admitted under the Rule, it is appropriate to "start from the premise that such reports of investigation are presumed to be reliable." <span class="Italic">In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation</span>, 723 F.2d 238, 265 (3d Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. v. Zenith</span> <span class="Italic">Radio Corp.</span>, 475 U.S. 574, 106 S. Ct. 1348, 89 L. Ed.2d 538 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, however, the Rule does state that official reports may be excluded when the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness. To make this determination, the following factors should be examined: (1) The timeliness of the investigation; (2) the special skill or experience of the official; (3) whether a hearing was held and the level at which conducted; and (4) whether the report was prepared in anticipation of litigation. Rule 803(8) Advisory Committee's note; <span class="Italic">Fayson v. Schmadl</span>, 126 F.R.D. 419, 420 (D.D.C. 1988). In applying these factors to OPM's report of investigation and the earlier report prepared by the INS, we find first that both investigations were timely conducted. Specifically, although the appellant submitted an SF-171 for the position of Border Patrol Agent on July 16, 1990, she did not submit the required SF-86, Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions, until June 24, 1992, and the INS promptly conducted its investigation between July 12, 1992, and August 31, 1992. Similarly, the appellant received a summer appointment to the position of Grounds Inspection Clerk on June 20, 1994, her appointment was extended on October 1, 1994, and OPM timely conducted its investigation between December 20, 1994 and January 31, 1995. Thus, the application of Factor 1 to the investigative reports in question would weigh in favor of their admission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Factor 2, special skill or experience of the official conducting the investigation, cannot be assessed in this case because the investigators are not identified. The application of Factor 3, whether a hearing was held, would weigh against admitting the reports into the record since the record does not reflect that either of the investigations here were conducted in that fashion. Finally, the application of Factor 4, whether the investigative reports were prepared in anticipation of litigation, would weigh in favor of their admission since, to the contrary, the investigations here were conducted under OPM's authority to investigate the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service. 5 CFR 5.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inasmuch as the application of the majority of the factors which can be assessed would weigh in favor of admitting the reports, and considering the general presumption of admissibility, it is likely that, under the Federal Rules of Evidence, the reports would be admitted, but that their substantial deficiencies, as previously recounted, would be considered in determining their probative value. Thus, whether considered under the rationale of <span class="Italic">Borninkhof</span> or under Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the investigative reports in question were properly admitted into the record, notwithstanding that, overall, their probative value is marginal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, despite the fact that the investigative reports themselves are, on the whole, unreliable, certain specific portions of the reports contain evidence that is probative and inherently trustworthy. For example, the INS investigator summarized official police records he reviewed during the course of the investigation. The August 1984 and the September 1985 arrests were verified by the INS investigator's examination of records of the Val Verde County Sheriff's Department and the Del Rio Police Department, respectively. The November 1986 arrest is documented in the INS investigative report by copies of the pertinent police records. <span class="Italic">Rint v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 MSPR 69, 72 (normal office records, compiled in the ordinary course of business, are admissible and are entitled to substantial weight), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 950 F.2d 731 (1991) (Table). Of this criminal activity, the appellant admitted only the August 1984 and November 1986 arrests on the SF-86 she submitted in 1992, and the September 1985 arrest for DWI that was subsequently reduced to a charge of Public Intoxication on the SF-171 she submitted in 1994. Thus, there is, within the INS investigative report, probative trustworthy evidence that the appellant engaged in criminal activity as set forth above, but did not fully admit to such activity when she applied for the instant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's prior use of marijuana, there is also probative trustworthy evidence in the INS investigative report. Specifically, the investigator reviewed the applicant files of the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department and the Dallas Police Department where the appellant had unsuccessfully sought employment. Those files contained a narrative which summarized the results of a polygraph examination the appellant took on December 13, 1991, and the investigator quoted specific portions of that narrative in the investigative report. <span class="Italic">Rint</span>, 48 MSPR at 72. The summary of the results of the polygraph is inherently trustworthy in that it concerns a matter the investigator observed pursuant to his or her duty to prepare the report. Federal Rules of Evidence 803(8)(B). Specifically, it was reported that, during the polygraph, the appellant initially stated that she had used marijuana experimentally in 1973 while in high school and on several occasions in 1985 and 1986, not to exceed 20 times, during the course of her undercover work....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question remains whether this evidence rises to the level of preponderant evidence, in view of the appellant's hearing testimony. Although not required to, she exercised her option to have a hearing and to give testimony. <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 648, 655 (1992). The administrative judge must consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at the hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record. <span class="Italic">Webb v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 35, 38 (1988). As noted, the appellant was the only witness to testify at the hearing. She admitted to the DWI arrest in 1985, and to the 1986 charge of Public Intoxication to which she pled "no contest" and was fined. She also testified, however, that she last used marijuana in 1986 in connection with her undercover work, denying that she told the polygraph examiner that she had used it more recently. And she denied that she was arrested for Public Intoxication in July 1986. The administrative judge who heard the appellant's testimony and observed her demeanor failed to assess her credibility, consistent with the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987) (to resolve credibility issues, an administrative judge must identify the factual questions in dispute, summarize the evidence on each disputed question, state which version he believes, and explain in detail why he found the chosen version more credible, considering such factors as: (1) The witness's opportunity and capacity to observe the event or act in question; (2) the witness's character; (3) any prior inconsistent statement by the witness; (4) a witness's bias, or lack of bias; (5) the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence; (6) the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events; and (7) the witness's demeanor).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inasmuch as the proper disposition of this case depends upon the <span id="Page_1490"></span>resolution of disputed factual matters, this appeal must be remanded so that the administrative judge, who conducted the hearing in which these matters were addressed, can make the initial findings and conclusions....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Noffke v. DOD</span>, 809 Fed. Appx. 877, 880 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("There is no merit to Ms. Noffke's argument that the deciding official needed to rely on the evidence underlying the OIG report in the pre-termination proceedings. There is no bar to the deciding official's relying on summary documents."); <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-15-0820-I-1 (NP 5/27/2016) ("The appellant argues that, because this investigator did not produce photographs or videotape of him committing the misconduct, his testimony has no probative value. The appellant's argument is unavailing. The Board has held that circumstantial evidence of charges allows for a strong inference of culpability if it is not reasonably and satisfactorily explained by the appellant. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 521, 524 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 92 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 420, 425 (1996) (explaining that, when there is no significant contrary proof, circumstantial evidence can constitute proof by preponderant evidence)."); <span class="Italic">McClain v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 230, 239-40 (1997) (suitability decision discounting police reports not based on sworn statements from the arresting officers, participants in the incidents, or other corroborating evidence); <span class="Italic">Ahr v. DOJ</span>, 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984) (police reports admissible in Board proceedings despite their hearsay nature); <span class="Italic">Alston v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 172, 175 (1984) (to rely on an investigative report, the Board "must be able to express some confidence in the underlying reliability and probative value of the evidence").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The weight of a report does not <span class="Italic">seem</span> to be materially lessened if the agency destroys investigative backup notes. <span class="Italic">Dancer v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 214, 217 (1984), dismissed a due process challenge to an adverse action by observing, as to the contention that notes were destroyed, that the report was in the agency file and that the agency official who prepared it and the complaining employees who were interviewed all testified at the hearing. The record contained meaningful evidence on the charges against the appellant without the notes; the appellant had access to the evidence presented and an opportunity to cross-examine the individuals involved. The Board distinguished a case involving the denial of meaningful cross-examination, <span class="Italic">Banks v. FAA</span>, 687 F.2d 92 (5th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM investigation reports were sufficient to support an adverse action directed by OPM against individuals accused of falsifying employment applications. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Howard v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 617, 620 (1986). Another employee was demoted for off-duty misconduct. The only evidence was a police report containing a policeman's account of an interview with a complaining witness. The hearsay was insufficient to qualify as preponderant evidence even when the appellant failed to testify. The account of the interview in the report, considered of <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> probative value as double hearsay, could not be enhanced sufficiently to meet the agency burden of proof by a negative inference that could have been drawn from the appellant's failure to testify in opposition to the contents of the report. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arthur v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 239, 242 (1982). An OPM investigator's report was insufficient to sustain a charge of a false answer in response to an employment inquiry concerning arrests or charges against the appellant. The investigator relied on information about alleged criminal charges in the appellant's employment file with a previous employer, but he did not check official court records and the records that were checked were not copied. The investigator admitted he had no knowledge of the alleged charge or conviction, and a summary of court records indicated no record of charges against the appellant. <span class="Italic">Futrell v. DOJ</span>, 57 MSPR 640, 644-45 (1993). But a police report coupled with other evidence is probative, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-15-0206-I-1 (NP 4/21/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's petition asserts that the administrative judge relied solely on the police report as evidence in sustaining the conduct unbecoming charge, the administrative judge largely relied on the appellant's own admissions and the logical conclusions that result from those admissions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Arthur v. Department of the Army</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 239, 241-43 (1982) (finding that an agency failed to prove its misconduct charge where it relied, in toto, on data excerpted from an arrest record, a police report of an interview with a complaining witness, and a court calendar with receipt stating the employee was convicted)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency attempts to shield the names of not only witnesses but also its investigator, the hearsay problem becomes more acute. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 289, 296 n.4 (1981), a suitability appeal, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statements to OPM's investigator were double hearsay, since (1) the informants lacked firsthand knowledge of the events they described and (2), even as to what they had heard, the informants were not produced as witnesses. OPM's investigator was not a witness at the Board's hearing, thus making the reported statements triple hearsay. The Court of Claims has noted that "This type of attenuated and highly unreliable evidence is qualitatively, at best, triple hearsay. ["] <span class="Italic">Cooper v. United States</span>, 639 F.2d 727, 730, 226 Ct. Cl. 75 (1980). OPM could have eliminated one entire level of hearsay by presenting its investigator as a witness. While the investigator could not have vouched for the truth of the information he had received, he could at least have described the circumstances in which he received that information, the basis of his informants' knowledge of the events in question, and related facts that might have enabled the presiding official to attribute some probative value to that information. Similarly, OPM could have provided affidavits from its informants with no apparent administrative burden of expense. It stretches credulity to expect the Board, in a matter fraught with Due Process implications, to rely upon non-verbatim hearsay accounts by an unidentified investigator as to what he or she was told in unsworn interviews with persons some of whom are themselves unidentified and all of whom lacked firsthand knowledge of the incidents in question. <span class="Italic">See generally Borninkhof v.
