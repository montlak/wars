<p class="Body-Text">A change to a lower grade is involuntary if it is caused by an adverse action knowingly proposed without good cause, but a procedural defect in a proposed adverse action does not render the downgrading involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. MSPB</span> (9th Cir. 1981 NP No. 80-7132) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-026.html#sec6-27">Time Pressure</a>") ; <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 79 MSPR 576, 582 (1998) ("If the appellant can establish that he agreed to a demotion because he wanted to avoid another threatened action, and if he can show further that the threatened action could not be substantiated, then the demotion may be considered coerced, and therefore involuntary."); <span class="Italic">Ryals v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 409, 411 (1983) ("While we agree with appellant that a change to lower grade is involuntary if it is caused by an adverse action knowingly proposed without good cause, <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States</span>, 389 F.2d 815 (Ct. Cl. 1968), we cannot conclude that a proposed action lacks good cause merely because an agency has committed a procedural error by taking it under 5 U.S.C. 4303. Such an error neither affects the merits of the agency's case nor requires reversal of the action."); <span class="Italic">Griffin v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 59, 60 n.1 (1982) ("Absent a showing by appellants that the agency knew or believed that the proposed downgrading could not be substantiated or that an arguable basis for the agency's action <span id="Page_1928"></span>did not exist, the fact, standing alone, that an arbitration decision found that the Review Clerk position should be placed in the PS-6 salary level does not render appellant's acceptance of the downgraded position involuntary."). The appellant is not unlawfully demoted if he accepts demotion in lieu of another action, e.g., removal, that would be taken for a valid reason, e.g., failure to pass a required examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 84, 88 (1992).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hartman v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 565, 567-68 (1992), provides an example of allegations sufficient to warrant a hearing based on a demotion agreed to and then challenged as coerced by an unwarranted threat of adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a reduction in grade can be an adverse action appealable to the Board, the Board is without jurisdiction to review a downgrade that the employee accepted voluntarily. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(1) and (2); 752.401(b)(9); <span class="Italic">Gaudette v. Department of Transportation</span>, 832 F.2d 1256, 1258 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The appellant bears the burden of proving that his reduction in grade was involuntary, and thus within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]; <span class="Italic">Lamb v. United States Postal Service</span>, 46 MSPR 470, 474 (1990) (appellant has burden of proving Board jurisdiction over appeal from alleged involuntary resignation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant can establish that he agreed to a demotion because he wanted to avoid the threatened removal, and if he can show further that the agency knew that the threatened removal could not be substantiated, then the demotion may be considered coerced, and therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lamb</span>, 46 MSPR at 475. To establish that he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was coerced into a downgrade, which was therefore involuntary. His allegation must be supported by factual assertions indicating that it is not a mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argues in part that his reduction in grade was involuntary because, contrary to the agency's threat, the agency knew that it could not substantiate a removal action for falsifying a time record. The appellant asserts that the agency threatened to end his 28-year career because instead of reporting the hours he worked on a shift as being from 12:15 <span class="small">A.M.</span> to 9:55 <span class="small">A.M.</span>, he advised the payroll division that he had worked from 11:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to 7:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> He explains that he misread the schedule, and a supervisor telephoned him at home after 11:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span> to tell him to report to work. Further, the appellant claims, when a different supervisor questioned him about the discrepancy two or three days later, he realized that he had erred in simply reporting his regular shift, and he and the supervisor called payroll and corrected the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge noted the appellant's argument regarding the validity of the purported charge against him, he did not afford the appellant a jurisdictional hearing, and did not determine whether the appellant showed that the agency knew that the threatened removal action could not be sustained. If the appellant's assertions regarding the threatened action are true, they would support a finding that the agency knew that the threatened removal could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (to sustain a falsification charge, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency). Therefore, we find that the appellant's allegations are sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 32 MSPR 100, 102-03 (1987). The hearing should be followed by a new determination regarding jurisdiction, and, if the administrative judge finds jurisdiction, adjudication of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hartman</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Law v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 30, 36-37 (1997), determining that the appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing based on her allegation that she accepted a downgrading because her supervisor threatened to fire her if she made just one more mistake:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant's allegations regarding the voluntariness of her demotion are also sufficient to warrant a jurisdictional hearing in that regard. An action initiated by an employee is presumed to be voluntary, and thus outside the Board's jurisdiction, unless the employee can show that the action was obtained through duress or coercion or shows that a reasonable person would have been misled by the agency. <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Department of Justice,</span> 60 MSPR 244, 250 (1993). Thus, if an employee can show that he or she accepted a demotion to avoid a threatened removal and can further show that the agency knew or should have known that the removal could not be substantiated, then the demotion may be considered coerced and therefore involuntary. <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 438, 443 (1996). To establish entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing based on the voluntariness of a demotion, an employee must make a nonfrivolous allegation that he or she was coerced into accepting the demotion; the allegation must be supported by factual assertions indicating that it is not a mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> pleading. <span class="Italic">Hartman v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 53 MSPR 565, 567 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged below that her demotion was involuntary because, shortly after her assignment to the EAS-14 Senior Legal Secretary position, her first-line supervisor threatened to remove her if she made just one more mistake, unless she accepted the demotion. She stated that she believed that the probability of her not making another mistake was "non-existent," and, therefore, she "believed that her removal was all but guaranteed." She stated that her supervisor threatened her before affording her an adequate opportunity to improve her performance and that he failed to follow the agency's progressive discipline policy. She stated that, for these reasons, as well as her financial obligations to her family, her age, and her job seniority, she signed a voluntary demotion form under duress. We find that the appellant's allegations of duress are sufficient to entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing on the involuntariness of her demotion. <span class="Italic">See Hartman</span>, 53 MSPR at 567-68.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wyatt v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WYATT_JULIAN_AT_3443_04_0335_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250322.pdf">101 MSPR 28</a>, 40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-20, 2006 MSPB 2 (2006), remanded a constructive demotion claim for a merits determination based on the allegation that the action resulted from an improper threat of an agency action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidating it. <span class="Italic">See Bynum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 662, 665 (1998). However, one way in which an appellant may show that a settlement agreement was coerced, and thus, involuntary, is by establishing that the agency threatened to take a future disciplinary action that it knew or should have known could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">See Fassett v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 4 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the administrative judge, the appellant alleged that the agency erred in issuing the 1999 notice of removal because the appellant had met all the requirements of the PS-05 Maintenance Mechanic position prior to attending IES training in accordance with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. In support of this argument, the appellant quoted a portion of a collective bargaining agreement which purportedly addressed the selection of applicants to the maintenance craft and provided that an employee who was detailed to a position contingent upon satisfactory completion of training shall be declared the successful applicant upon satisfactory completion of the training or one year from the date detailed. The appellant also submitted evidence in support of his argument that the agency could not properly remove him for failure to complete the IES training after the agency had detailed him to the PS-05 Maintenance Mechanic position for more than one year. Based on this evidence, we find that the appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that the agency knew or should have known that it could not substantiate the charge contained in the 1999 notice of removal and that the agency therefore coerced the appellant into executing the settlement agreement wherein he agreed to accept the reduction in grade to the PS-03 Laborer Custodian position and to waive his right to appeal that action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rethaber v. MSPB</span>, 233 Fed. Appx. 1001, 1004 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), discerned no lack of justification for the threat of a removal that led the appellant to accept a demotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rethaber also argues that her acceptance of the demotion was involuntary because it was obtained through coercion by the Agency. An employee may show that an adverse action was obtained though coercion by proving that the agency did not have reasonable grounds to propose the adverse action in the first place. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1026 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987). "If an employee can show that the agency knew that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated, the threatened action by the agency is purely coercive." <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Ms. Rethaber argues that the agency did not have reasonable grounds to propose her removal because she was never told what was specifically wrong with her rating decisions, as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(A)(i). However, prior to Ms. Rethaber's removal she received formal written counseling memoranda, a performance assistance plan, and a performance improvement plan all indicating that the accuracy percentage of her ratings was below the required level. These communications advised Ms. Rethaber of required performance standards. Further, Ms. Rethaber met with her supervisors on numerous occasions to discuss specific errors with her ratings decisions. Under these circumstances, we find that Ms. Rethaber has not met her burden of proving that the agency knew that the reasons for the threatened removal could not be substantiated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shank v. USDA,</span> CH-0752-10-0153-I-1 (NP 2/24/2011), describes circumstances underlying an agreement to take a reduction in grade later unsuccessfully challenged as involuntary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disputes the administrative judge's statements that she was aware that the agency had problems with her performance and that she chose to take the reduction in grade to avoid being placed on a performance improvement plan (PIP). However, she testified that, after several fully satisfactory ratings, she received a marginal rating at the end <span id="Page_1929"></span>of 1992, and that the agency denied her within-grade increase in 1993. She also testified that, following her detail, Thomas Sommer, her second-line supervisor, summoned her to his office and explained that, because of continuing issues with her performance, she had several options--keep working in her position and face a possible unsatisfactory rating, PIP, and removal, or accept a downgrade. In addition, she testified that Steven Davis, her first-line supervisor, had also talked with her about the possibility of her being placed on a PIP based on her continuing performance problems, of the fact that she might lose her job if she failed the PIP, and of the option that she could request a voluntary downgrade to a GS-9 position. She acknowledged in her testimony that Davis had had a discussion with her husband, who was also an employee, regarding her performance problems, and that he had conveyed that information to her.</p>

Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-13-0575-I-1 (NP 7/9/2014) (remanding constructive downgrading appeal for hearing on whether the appellant's performance, as alleged, was sufficient that the agency knew or should have known it could not take a threatened removal based on the results of a PIP); <span class="Italic">Harris v. VA</span>, 114 MSPR 239, 2010 MSPB 122 (2010) (remanding a demotion appeal based on the agency's grant of a within-step increase covering a period that the appellant's performance was characterized as unacceptable, leading to a removal proposal and decision and the appellant's "abeyance" agreement to accept a demotion with a waiver of Board appeal rights); <span class="Italic">Huyler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 570, 2006 MSPB 98 (2006) (remanding demotion appeal for further development of whether the agency improperly threatened the appellant with removal based on the agency's assumption that his position was subject to deployment and therefore required the appellant to meet applicable physical requirements). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Rathbun v. VA</span>, 293 Fed. Appx. 764, 765-66 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (demotion requested and received following a threat of removal of an employee whose academic credentials did not meet job requirements was not involuntary; the agency had the right to determine the requirements of the job and the employee had the choice of being removed and fighting the removal on the merits rather than avoiding removal through acceptance of a demotion); <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 106 MSPR 520, 529 n.7, 2007 MSPB 207 (2007) (mere allegation that a downgrade was accepted "under protest" did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of coercion conferring Board jurisdiction; a choice between unpleasant alternatives does not make the resulting decision involuntary); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-16-0491-I-1 (NP 9/23/2016) ("At the time the appellant accepted the Mission Support Assistant position, the agency had not proposed any adverse action against him, although it had warned him that it might do so if he declined the agency's offer. In other words, the agency did not know whether it would eventually propose removal or some lesser action, and it had a number of possible charges it could bring, but had not yet decided what those charges might be. Because we do not know what the potential future charges might be, there is no way to evaluate whether the agency knew or should have known that the charges could not be substantiated.").</p>
