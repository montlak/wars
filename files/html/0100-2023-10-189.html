<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-190"><span class="space">b.</span> Continuity of Union Before and After Change in Affiliation</h5>
<p class="noindent">When the amendment of certification process is invoked by a union seeking to change its affiliation to another union, FLRA determines if there is substantial continuity between the union before and after the affiliational change, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal and NAGE Local R7-72</span>, 46 FLRA 76, 84-85 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further agree with the Regional Director's finding that the petition was supported by evidence of substantial continuity between the union existing before and after the change in affiliation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Financial Institution Employees of America, Local</span> 1182, 475 U.S. 192 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Financial Institution Employees</span>); <span class="Italic">Union of Federal Employees</span>, 41 FLRA at 572 n.2, 587 n.4. For the reasons discussed by the Regional Director, including the fact that the Local's officers served as representatives in negotiated grievances and made submissions to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and that the Local continued to operate with the same degree of autonomy after the election as before, we agree that there was "no material change in the Local's daily operation, autonomy or control of operation and it continued as the representative of employees in various representational matters."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Again we emphasize that the issues to be resolved in this application for review relate to employees in the petitioned-for unit. Thus, the analysis of representational continuity must be made in terms of the GS unit. In this regard, we simply do not know the import of the failure of the NAF unit to file an AC petition. It is not evident from the record before us that the NAF unit has, despite the results of the affiliation vote, retained its affiliation with NAGE. Further, even assuming that the NAF unit has not formally affiliated with NFFE and that NAGE is correct in contending that the GS unit therefore would have to elect new officers to replace those remaining with NAGE Local R7-72 if the certification of the GS unit is amended, the record does indicate that two of the officers are members of the unit involved in this case. Moreover, continuity of officers is only one element the Authority relies on in determining representational continuity. <span class="Italic">Union of Federal Employees</span>, 41 FLRA at 572, 582 (Authority agreed with Regional Director that there was sufficient continuity based on, among other things, retention of officers). Other elements relating to local autonomy and control of day-to-day operations are also considered to be strong indicia of representational continuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 582. In view of all the factors cited by the Regional Director, we find sufficient continuity of representation has been demonstrated and that the application does not establish a basis to grant review of the Regional Director's decision in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, N.Y. NG and Nat'l Fed'n of Civilian Technicians, N.Y. State Council</span>, 46 FLRA 1468, 1473-74 (1993) ("NYACT is attempting to terminate its relationship with the certified representative. Such conduct is not properly accomplished in an amendment of certification petition."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot, Naval Air Station Alameda, Cal. and IAM Lodge 1584</span>, 47 FLRA 242, 246 (1993) (disallowing amendment of certification to reflect result of union merger without <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> procedures because "it has not been demonstrated that the merger conforms to the wishes of the membership of IAM Lodge 739").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA and Nat'l Nurses United</span>, 65 FLRA 259, 260-263 (2010), demonstrated FLRA's disinclination to examine too closely changes in the union organizational structure after the regional director's decision to approve amendment of a certification to reflect an affiliational change:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_181"></span>The individuals filing applications for review (Applicants) make largely identical claims. The Applicants assert that NNU has not conducted itself as it said it would before the RD granted the petition changing the bargaining unit employees' exclusive representative affiliation from UAN to NNU. Specifically, the Applicants claim that, since the RD's decision to grant the petition, NNU has changed the structure of NVAC. In this regard, the Applicants point to NNU's removal of NVAC President Alice Staggs, to NNU's removal of NVAC President Alice Staggs, NVAC Manhattan Local President Cathy Benjamin-Bovell, and business representative Hector Ramos, even though a document included in the ballot package stipulated that NVAC's leadership would remain the same until elections could be held....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Applicants do not assert that review is warranted on any of the grounds set forth in &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations. Moreover, the record does not show that the Applicants intend to make any such claim. Instead, the Applicants ask the Authority to reverse the RD's decision based on events that took place after the RD completed the investigation and subsequently granted the petition. The Applicants do not challenge the RD's decision to grant the petition and concede that they agreed to the change in affiliation based on the information that was presented to the RD and on which the RD made his decision to grant the petition. Therefore, as the Applicants fail to challenge the RD's decision to grant the petition, and absent any other claim that comports with the requirements for review set forth in &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations, we find that review of the RD's decision is not warranted under the Authority's Regulations and deny the applications for review.[9] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Fayetteville, N.C.</span>, 65 FLRA 191 (2010) (application denied for failing to assert any grounds for review set forth in &#x00A7; 2422.31(c), including any challenge to RD's determinations).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;As we deny the applications for review for failing to assert grounds for review pursuant to &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) of the Authority's Regulations, we find that it is unnecessary to address NNU's claim that it has maintained continuity of representation. For the same reason, we also find that it is unnecessary to address the VA's request that the Authority remand this matter to the Authority's San Francisco Regional Office for additional factual investigation and review.</p>
<p class="noindent">A trusteeship imposed by a national union on its local before the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> balloting blocks an affiliation change by the petitioning local on the national's objection to the unit clarification petition. <span class="Italic">EPA and NFFE Local 2050</span>, 52 FLRA 772, 781-82 (1996), established a process for addressing a challenge to the trusteeship that blocks the change in affiliation (FLRA noted that a challenge to the trusteeship was denied by the DOL Assistant Secretary but an appeal was pending):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Where the Regional Director determines that a trusteeship was established "in conformity with the procedural requirements of [the parent labor organization's] constitution and bylaws and authorized or ratified after a fair hearing either before the executive board or before such other body as may be provided in accordance with its constitution and bylaws[,]" as provided by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 458.28, the Regional Director, in the absence of a final decision by the Assistant Secretary resolving the trusteeship matter, will presume the validity of the trusteeship and will dismiss the petition on the ground that the person purporting to act for the incumbent labor organization has no authority to act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Where the Regional Director determines that a trusteeship was not established "in conformity with the procedural requirements of [the parent labor organization's] constitution and bylaws and authorized or ratified after a fair hearing either before the executive board or before such other body as may be provided in accordance with its constitution and bylaws[,]" as provided by 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 458.28, the Regional Director, in the absence of a final decision by the Assistant Secretary resolving the trusteeship matter, will place the petition in abeyance. Upon being notified by the parties of the issuance of a final decision by the Assistant Secretary, the Regional Director will take appropriate action in light of that decision to either process or dismiss the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD Properly Presumed the Validity of the Trusteeship In This Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that NFFE National gave notice to Local 2050's President, Executive Board, and membership on September 21 that it had established the trusteeship and cited to the provisions of its constitution that allowed such a trusteeship. NFFE National informed the officers and members that it had removed the authority of the officers and appointed a trustee, in whom it vested sole authority to act on behalf of Local 2050. NFFE National also informed the officers and members that a hearing would be held on the matter within 90 days. A hearing was held on December 6, within 90 days of the September 21 notice, and the trusteeship was upheld by the President of NFFE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We affirm the RD's finding that NFFE National's establishment of the trusteeship was in conformity with the provisions of the NFFE National constitution, which include provisions for a fair hearing (<span class="Italic">see</span> note 4, above). It is undisputed that the trusteeship was established prior to the taking of the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> vote and that no final decision has been issued resolving the trusteeship matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 3, above. Accordingly, applying the standard set forth above, we find that it was proper in this case for the RD to presume the validity of the trusteeship.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Welch Had No Authority to File the Petition</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2422.1(d) of the Authority's Regulations provides that an AC petition "may be filed by an activity or agency or by a labor organization which is currently...an exclusive representative." Welch did not have standing to file the petition in this case as an individual; only Local 2050 had standing to file the petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 11, above. Welch filed the petition as president of Local 2050 on October 6. However, his authority to act as president of Local 2050 had been removed by NFFE National on September 21.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will remand a petition if it cannot make the determinations necessary to resolve the petition.[23] Because the record does not permit us to resolve the dispute, we remand the petition to the RD to make further findings. In remanding, we direct the RD to investigate and provide more information on the issue of standing, including additional details on when and how the trusteeship became effective and the impact of the Department of Labor's determination concerning the impropriety of the trusteeship, and whether the March 2017 election moots any issues. While the decision states that the parties agreed that the trusteeship was imposed prior to the filing of the petition, the decision does not explain how the trusteeship became effective and whether it took effect prior to the Incumbent Union's actions to disaffiliate. If the trusteeship was imposed after the Incumbent Union filed the petition, the trusteeship would have had no effect on the petition.[25] As we remand for further findings, we do not address the Intervenor's additional arguments.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA will not enforce a union's constitutional provisions requiring notice to the union of a vote to change affiliation, presumably so that a trusteeship may be imposed before the vote.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority originally granted in part and denied in part the application for review filed by NFFE.&#x2003;The application for review was granted on the following issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To what extent, if any, was NFFE entitled to notice that a <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>vote would be conducted in this case? If it was entitled to any such notice, did it receive such notice?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">What is the effect of a trusteeship upon a petition to amend certification where the trusteeship is imposed after a <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>vote occurs and after a petition to amend certification has been filed?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that NFFE was not entitled, under the <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>doctrine, to notice that a vote to change affiliation would be conducted. We also find that a trusteeship imposed after a petition to amend certification has been filed has no effect on the petition. Accordingly, we affirm the RD's Decision and Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and RD's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Local is the exclusive representative of all general schedule and wage grade Activity employees throughout New Mexico.&#x2003;The President of the Local received a petition from bargaining unit members requesting that the Local hold a special election to vote on changing its affiliation from NFFE to LIUNA. The Local hired the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to run a mail ballot election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Local President sent a letter to all bargaining unit members, informing them: (1) that he had received a request to hold an election to change affiliation from NFFE to LIUNA; (2) that the Local would hold such an election; (3) that the Local was mailing this letter to each member's last known home address; (4) the reasons for changing affiliation, as stated in the petition requesting a vote; (5) the representation choices that would be voted upon; (6) what affiliation meant; (7) that ballots should arrive shortly; and (8) that bargaining unit members could call the Local's headquarters collect to ask questions about the election.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_182"></span>AAA mailed 122 ballots with self-addressed, stamped envelopes marked "Secret Ballot" to all dues paying members of the bargaining unit, with a return deadline. The voting instructions contained a phone number to call if members had questions. The ballot provided two choices:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">YES, I approve the disaffiliation of Local 1636 with the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), and affiliation with the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">NO, I disapprove of the disaffiliation with the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During a 9-day period, the Local President traveled throughout New Mexico to those locations where approximately 90 percent of the Local's membership was located. During that time, NFFE and LIUNA sent information to the Local's members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">AAA counted all ballots received by the deadline.&#x2003;Of the 45 envelopes received, 1 was rejected for lack of identification. Of the 44 ballots counted, 40 favored the affiliation change, and 4 did not favor the change in affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thereafter, the Local filed a petition to amend certification; the petition identified the Local as an affiliate of LIUNA and of NFFE. A few days later, the Local filed an amended petition that deleted the statement identifying the Local as affiliated with LIUNA. Subsequently, the Local filed a second amended petition (hereinafter, the petition) that also did not state that the Local was affiliated with LIUNA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the petition was filed, NFFE notified the Local that it had imposed a trusteeship upon it effective immediately. That same day, NFFE notified the Local President that he was no longer an officer. In response, the Local President wrote:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As you know [,...] Local 1636 dues paying members voted 40 Yes, 4 No, 1 Challenged to disaffiliate with NFFE. I will pay dues through [the voting deadline date]. I do not recognize the Trusteeship as we are no longer affiliated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;NFFE Was Not Entitled to Notice that a Vote to Change Affiliation Would be Conducted under <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>; and the Authority Does Not Enforce NFFE's Constitution</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE argues that it was entitled to notice that a vote to change affiliation was scheduled, in accordance with its Constitution and <span class="Italic">Montrose. </span>For the following reasons, we find that NFFE was not entitled to notice that a vote to change affiliation was scheduled. We also find that we lack jurisdiction to enforce NFFE's Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Procedural Criteria Established in <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> Do Not Require Notice to NFFE</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To amend the designation of an exclusive representative in an existing unit to reflect a change in affiliation, the procedures set forth in <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>must be followed. Under <span class="Italic">Montrose, </span>to ensure that an amendment of certification conforms to the desires of a union's membership, four procedural criteria must be met:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)[a] proposed change in affiliation should be the subject of a special meeting of the members of the incumbent labor organization, called for this purpose only, with adequate advance notice provided to the entire membership; (2) the meeting should take place at a time and place convenient to all members; (3) adequate time for discussion of the proposed change should be provided, with all members given an opportunity to raise questions within the bounds of normal parliamentary procedure; and (4) a vote by the members of the incumbent labor organization on the question should be taken by secret ballot, with the ballot clearly stating the change proposed and the choices inherent therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Montrose, </span>4 A/SLMR at 860. The Authority has determined that where geographic dispersion precludes a special meeting of all of the members of the bargaining unit, a mail ballot may be substituted. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo</span> <span class="Italic">Area, Gallup, New Mexico, </span>34 FLRA 428, 444-45 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied the procedural criteria established under <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>in other cases where there was no agreement on change in affiliation between two national labor organizations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, National Guard Bureau, New York National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard, Division of Military and Naval Affairs, Latham,</span> <span class="Italic">New York and National Federation of Civilian Technicians, New York State Council and Association of Civilian Technicians, Inc., </span>46 FLRA 1468, 1469 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock</span> <span class="Italic">Island, Illinois and National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local R7-72 and National Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees, </span>46 FLRA 76, 79, 83-84 (1992); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Navajo Area, Gallup, New Mexico and National</span> <span class="Italic">Council of Bureau of Indian Affairs Educators,</span> 33 FLRA 482, 487, 492 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf. Union of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 405 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army</span> <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, St. Louis, Missouri, </span>41 FLRA 562, 583 (1991) (applying the four procedural criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>where a local union sought to disaffiliate from a national labor organization and not affiliate with another national labor organization, but maintain independent status). Apart from its assertion that the Authority "should review whether the antiquated changing of affiliation" procedural criteria established under <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> apply in cases such as this one, involving "adversarial entities,"...NFFE provides no arguments why application of the procedural criteria established under <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> is wrong. Therefore, we find that a modification to <span class="Italic">Montrose </span>to require notification to a national labor organization of a disaffiliation vote is not warranted at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Assistant Secretary of Labor Is the Appropriate Authority for Enforcement of NFFE's Constitution</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE contends that its Constitution requires that local officers provide NFFE with notice that a vote to change affiliation is scheduled, and that by failing to do so, they have violated their Oaths of Office....&#8197;In essence, NFFE requests that the Authority enforce NFFE's Constitution to require that local officers provide advance notice to the incumbent labor organization headquarters whenever employees plan to conduct a vote to change affiliation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has specifically recognized that the Assistant Secretary of Labor has "exclusive jurisdiction over Standards of Conduct" regarding issues that do not fall under the purview of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2419, </span>53 FLRA 835, 841 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local R5-66,</span> 17 FLRA 796, 813 (1985). That is, even assuming that a breach of NFFE's Constitution occurred, we are empowered to act regarding such a violation only if it also constitutes a violation of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See id.,</span> 17 FLRA at 814. NFFE's claim raises a Standards of Conduct issue, and raises no statutory claim. Accordingly, we conclude that the Authority has no jurisdiction to enforce NFFE's Constitutional claim in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;A Trusteeship Imposed After a Petition to Amend Certification has been Filed has no Effect on the Petition</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D. C and National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 2050 and Environmental Employees</span> <span class="Italic">Collectively Organized, </span>52 FLRA 772 (1996) <span class="Italic">(EPA),</span> the Authority addressed a trusteeship that had been imposed before the membership voted to change affiliation. The Authority stated that, in certain circumstances, an RD must presume the validity of such a trusteeship and that an RD should place a petition seeking amendment of certification in abeyance pending a decision on the validity of the trusteeship by the Assistant Secretary of Labor, if the RD is not satisfied as to the trusteeship's validity. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 781-82.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD here found that the trusteeship was irrelevant in determining whether the petition should be granted, because NFFE imposed it <span class="Italic">after </span>the Local filed the certification petition. NFFE offers no argument to the contrary. Therefore, we find that a trusteeship imposed after a petition to amend affiliation has been filed has no effect on the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Fayetteville and AFGE Local 1738</span>, 65 FLRA 191, 191 &#x0026; 192 n.2 (2010) (assertion that petitioner employees desire to establish a new local because they are dissatisfied with representation by the national is an internal union matter or a dispute concerning application of the union constitution within jurisdiction of Labor Department).</p>
