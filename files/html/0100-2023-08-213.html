<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-211"><span class="space">d.</span> Reduction in Pay; Locality Pay Issue; Failure to Obtain Pay Increase</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Pay correction disputes aside, not much litigation occurs over what constitutes a pay reduction for purposes of MSPB adverse action jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Calvin v. MSPB</span>, 254 Fed. Appx. 820, 821 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), helped to explain that basic pay must be reduced to permit an appeal from a reduction in pay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Board is determined by statute and, with statutory exceptions not here relevant, a transfer without reduction in grade or pay is not within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7512, 7701; <span class="Italic">Pierce v. MSPB</span>, 242 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The regulations, supported by precedent, state that a "reduction in pay," for purposes of Board jurisdiction, means a reduction in the basic rate of pay without regard to any other benefits or perquisites that may be lost in the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 531.202 ("Rate of Basic Pay means the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind.") Similarly, a loss of prestige or status due to transfer does not confer jurisdiction upon the Board where the grade or rate of pay has not been reduced. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (the Board does not have jurisdiction of reassignments "not constituting a reduction in grade or pay, even though the reassignment reduces the employee's status, duties or responsibilities"). Absent jurisdiction, the Board does not have jurisdiction to resolve factual disputes concerning the motive for the transfer. The dismissal of the appeal must be affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For there to be an appealable reduction in pay, the employee must have the status to appeal, that is, be an "employee" as the term is defined by 5 USC 7511. <span class="Italic">See Baseden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-3443-14-0468-I-1 (NP 12/4/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Baseden v. MSPB</span>, 629 Fed. Appx. 962 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim to what should have been a pay increase relating to adjustment of statutory pay caps does not establish jurisdiction over a reduction in pay arising from a furlough case, <span class="Italic">Gaydar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 121 MSPR 357, 359-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2014 MSPB 52 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reduction in pay is an appealable action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(4) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Arrington v. Department of the Navy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 8 (2012). For adverse action purposes, pay means "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4); <span class="Italic">Arrington</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, a reduction in pay is appealable only when "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee" decreases. <span class="Italic">Liebeck v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 696, 698 (1998). The Board and the courts have interpreted the term "rate of basic pay" restrictively because Congress intended adverse action rights, such as the right to appeal a reduction in pay, to be given a narrow construction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has not alleged that the agency decreased the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the GS-15 position he held. Instead, he asserts that the agency improperly failed to increase his rate of basic pay as an adjustment in connection with the reduction in the number of hours he worked due to the furlough. Such a failure to increase the appellant's rate of basic pay does not generally constitute a reduction in the rate of basic pay. <span class="Italic">See Caven v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adams v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-16-0670-I-1 (NP 7/21/2022), remanded for further consideration of a pay reduction appeal when the agency reassigned an employee with retained pay that the agency later determined was not authorized:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the appellant was not entitled to pay retention when she moved from the AD-06 Police Officer position to the GS-07 Physical Security Specialist position because the AD pay schedule is not a "covered pay schedule" and instead was established pursuant to the Secretary of Defense's authority to appoint law enforcement and security personnel "without regard to the pay provisions of title 5." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5361(5)-(6); 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2674(b)(5). However, OPM's regulations governing pay retention extend to an employee who is "moving to a position under a covered pay system from a position not under a covered pay system." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.102(a)(2). The parties have not addressed whether such regulations applied to the appellant when she moved to the Physical Security Specialist position in the GS pay system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5361(5) (considering the GS pay system a "covered pay schedule"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency has argued that the appellant was ineligible for pay retention under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.102(b)(1) because her reassignment that resulted in a reduction in pay was not the result of a management action but was made at her request and for her benefit. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.102(b)(1), an agency may not provide pay retention to an employee who is reduced in pay "for personal cause or at the employee's request." A reduction in pay is "at the employee's request" when it is "initiated by the employee for his or her benefit, convenience, or personal advantage." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103. A reduction in pay is "for personal cause" when it is "based on the conduct, character, or unacceptable performance of an employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, a reduction in pay is not "for personal cause" when it is based on an employee's "inability to perform the duties of his or her position because of a medical or physical condition beyond the employee's control." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant argued below and on review that she sought a reassignment because the agency failed to accommodate her disability in her Police Officer position, and that her reassignment with a reduction in pay was involuntary based on her reliance on the agency's misinformation regarding her entitlement to retained pay. Because the parties have not presented sufficient evidence and argument concerning the issues set forth above, we find that further adjudication is necessary to determine whether the appellant was entitled to pay retention and, accordingly, we remand the appeal for a jurisdictional hearing. On remand, the administrative judge should also allow the parties to present further evidence and argument regarding the question of whether the appellant was entitled to pay retention, including evidence on the following: whether OPM's regulations applied to the appellant when she moved to the Physical Security Specialist position in the GS pay system; and whether the appellant was ineligible for pay retention under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.102(b)(1) as the agency argues or whether she was in fact eligible because the reduction in pay was based on the appellant's "inability to perform the duties of his or her position because of a medical or physical condition beyond the employee's control."</p>

USDA</span>, 112 MSPR 160, 162-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-16, 2009 MSPB 162 (2009), involving consolidated appeals. The employees were relocated from one area to another, and upon their reassignments to their new worksites, their locality pay was reduced to the amount authorized for the new location. Their grades and steps remained the same. The Board lacked jurisdiction over the ensuing reduction in pay because the employees were not entitled to mandatory pay retention:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decisions, the AJ found that as a result of the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, Congress had statutorily defined the term "rate of basic pay" for the purposes of the grade and pay retention statutes, and that, in May 2005, the Office Personnel Management (OPM) revised the definition of the term "rate of basic pay" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 (2008), with the result being that both the statutory and regulatory provisions now include locality pay within those definitions.[2] The AJ found that the Board could now have jurisdiction over a reduction in pay appeal regarding locality pay because 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) defines "pay" in terms of "rate of basic pay," and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 (2008) now specifically defines the term "rate of basic pay" as including locality pay. However, the AJ found that the first inquiry in determining whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appellants' claims of a reduction in pay is which locality pay the appellants are lawfully entitled to in their new official worksite. The AJ reviewed OPM's locality rate pay-setting regulation and determined that the appellants are only lawfully entitled to the locality pay established for their new official worksite; they are not lawfully entitled to the locality pay of their former official worksite. Thus, the AJ concluded that, if the agency had failed to adjust the appellants' pay to reflect the locality pay for their new official worksite, the appellants' rates of basic pay would have been contrary to law or regulation. Additionally, the AJ noted that, even if the application of OPM's locality pay-setting regulation (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.609 (2008)) was in doubt, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.611(d) (2008) specifically provides that the reduction or termination of a locality rate under &#x00A7; 531.609 is not an adverse action for the purposes of the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. part 752. The AJ also found that the appellants are not entitled to pay retention because they did not go from one pay schedule to another pay schedule as a result of their reassignments to their new official worksite. Thus, the AJ found that the appellants had not been the subject of a reduction in pay within the Board's jurisdiction and he dismissed the appeals for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that OPM has further amended its grade and pay regulations, effective December 8 and 18, 2008, after the effective date of the agency's action reassigning the appellants in these cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> 73 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we reopen these appeals on our own motion to further consider the appellants' argument that they have suffered a reduction in pay because they are entitled to mandatory pay retention.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally has jurisdiction over an employee's reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(4), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Kile v.

Congress has defined "pay" to mean "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). Congress has defined "rate of basic pay" for the purposes of the grade and pay retention statutes to mean:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) the rate of basic pay payable to an employee under law or regulations before any deductions or additions of any kind, but including--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;any applicable locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5361(4). An employee may be entitled to pay retention where the employee's former rate of basic pay is greater than the maximum rate of basic pay payable for the grade of the employee's position immediately after the occurrence of, among other circumstances, a management action that places an employee under a different pay schedule. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5363(a)(3), (b)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.301(a)(4) (2008). The appellants reassert on review, in effect, that the agency erred in failing to accord them mandatory pay retention in the amount of their former rate of locality pay, as allegedly required under OPM's implementing pay retention regulations, specifically 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 536.101, .103, and .301(a) (2008), because locality pay is now included in the definition of "rate of basic pay" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5361(4) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008). In effect, the appellants assert that, as a result of a management action reassigning them to a new official worksite under a covered pay system with a different pay schedule that has resulted in a reduction of their payable rate of basic pay, which includes locality pay, they are entitled to mandatory pay retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ rejected this claim as legally meritless because the appellants had not, as a result of their reassignments, changed from one pay schedule to another pay schedule, given that the appellants had remained under the GS pay system in their new official worksite. Although the AJ's reasoning appears to misapprehend the difference between a "covered pay system" and a "pay schedule," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008), for the reasons set forth below, we find that the AJ's reasoning has not affected the appellants' substantive rights because the AJ correctly determined that the appellants had failed to assert nonfrivolous allegations of a right to pay retention and, thus, that the Board does not have jurisdiction over these cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's pay retention regulations provide, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under 5 U.S.C. 5363, an employee whose rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced as a result of a management action is entitled to retain his or her rate of basic pay <span class="Italic">under the circumstances prescribed in this part.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.101 (2008) (emphasis added). "Management action" is defined, in part, to mean "an action (not for personal cause) by an agency official not initiated or requested by an employee which may adversely affect the employee's grade or rate of basic pay." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008). Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.301(a) (2008) provides, in part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) &#x2003;Subject to the requirements in &#x00A7; 536.102 and this section, an agency must provide pay retention to an employee in a position under a covered pay system whose payable rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced (<span class="Italic">after application of any applicable geographic conversion under</span> &#x00A7; 536.303(a)) as a result of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4) A management action that places an employee under a different <span class="Italic">pay schedule.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.301(a)(4) (2008) (emphasis added). "<span class="Italic">Pay schedule</span> means a set of rate ranges established under a single authority--i.e., the General Schedule...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008). The GS locality rate schedules established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5304 are a form of pay schedule. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008) (definition of "pay schedule"). Each geographically-based GS locality rate schedule has a set of rate ranges established in accordance with requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5304. It is undisputed that the appellants' salaries have been set using the GS locality rate schedules. Thus, under the circumstances of these cases, the appellants were potentially entitled to pay retention because they were reassigned through a management action from a higher GS locality rate schedule to a lower GS locality rate schedule and their rates of basic pay, which include locality pay, were thereby reduced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_344"></span>However, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.301 (2008) also provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) &#x2003;If an employee's official worksite changes in conjunction with an action that <span class="Italic">may</span> entitle the employee to pay retention under paragraph (a) of this section, the agency must apply the geographic conversion rule in &#x00A7; 536.303(a) <span class="Italic">before</span> determining whether an employee's rate of basic pay otherwise would be reduced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.301(b) (2008) (emphasis added). Section 536.303(a) (2008) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Geographic conversion at time of action that may provide initial entitlement to pay retention</span>. If, in conjunction with a pay action that may entitle the employee to pay retention under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 536.301 or 536.302, an employee's official worksite is changed to a new location where different pay schedules apply, the agency must convert the employee's rate(s) of basic pay to the applicable pay schedule(s) in the new location before applying the pay retention rules in this subpart or any other simultaneous pay action (other than a general pay adjustment). The agency must identify the highest applicable rate range that would apply to the employee's position of record before the pay action as if that position were stationed at the new official worksite and determine the employee's converted payable rate of basic pay based on the step (or rate) in that range that corresponds to the employee's step (or rate) before the pay action. A reduction in an employee's payable rate of basic pay resulting from this geographic conversion is not a basis for entitlement to pay retention. The pay retention rules in this subpart must be applied as if the employee's payable rate of basic pay after geographic conversion is the employee's existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants do not dispute the agency's assertion that their pay locality areas went from the "Detroit-Warren-Flint, Michigan" pay locality area for their former official worksite to the "Rest of U.S." pay locality area for their new official worksite. Regarding the appellant in this lead case, Mark Zajac, it is undisputed that his GS-11, Step 9 rate of basic pay went from $74,729 to $69,026 as a result of the change in his official worksite and applicable pay locality area. Applying the above noted geographic conversion rule, Mr. Zajac's "existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action," was therefore $69,026, the rate of basic pay for GS-11, Step 9 under the "Rest of U.S." pay locality area. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.303(a) (2008); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.304(a)(3) (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of eligibility for pay retention is then determined by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.304(b) (2008), which, in pertinent part, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Determining initial pay retention entitlement</span>. When an employee becomes entitled to pay retention under &#x00A7; 536.301 or [&#x00A7;] 536.302, the agency must determine the employee's pay retention entitlement under the following rules (subject to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;If an employee's existing payable rate of basic pay is less than or equal to the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the grade of the employee's position of record immediately after the event causing the pay retention entitlement, the employee is entitled to the lowest rate of basic pay in such rate range that equals or exceeds the employee's existing payable rate of basic pay. If an employee's payable rate of basic pay is set at or below the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range, pay retention under this subpart ceases to apply to the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"<span class="Italic">Rate range</span> or <span class="Italic">range</span> means the range of rates of basic pay for a grade within an established pay schedule, excluding any retained rate." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "rate range" for GS-11 under the "Rest of U.S." pay locality area runs from $54,494 to $70,843. Mr. Zajac's $69,026 "existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action" was less than the "maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range for the grade of the employee's position of record immediately after the event causing the pay retention entitlement," $70,843, and thus Mr. Zajac was only entitled to "the lowest rate of basic pay in such rate range that equals or exceeds the employee's existing payable rate of basic pay." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 536.303(a) and .304(b)(1) (2008). Because Mr. Zajac's "existing payable rate of basic pay in effect immediately before the action" was $69,026, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.303(a) (2008), that is the rate of basic pay he is entitled to under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.304(a)-(b) (2008). Because that payable rate of basic pay is "below the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range, pay retention under this subpart <span class="Italic">ceases to apply to the employee." See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.304(b)(1) (2008) (emphasis added). Accordingly, Mr. Zajac did not assert nonfrivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, could show that the Board has jurisdiction over his claim of a reduction in pay and, thus, the AJ properly dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The seven remaining appellants are also under the GS pay schedule. We have applied the above legal analysis to each of those appellants' uncontested salary information and have determined that their "existing payable rate[s] of basic pay in effect immediately before the action" were "at or below the maximum rate of the highest applicable rate range" under the GS schedule for the "Rest of U.S." pay locality area applicable to their new official worksite and, thus, we find that the remaining appellants were not entitled to pay retention as well. Accordingly, we find that the remaining appellants have also failed to assert nonfrivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, could show that the Board has jurisdiction over their claims of a reduction in pay and, thus, that the AJ properly dismissed all of these consolidated cases for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In one reduction in pay appeal, the Board considered the definition of basic pay, with specific reference to locality pay as a possible component of basic pay, as that definition was modified by the OPM regulations implementing the 2004 Federal Workforce Flexibility Act, in <span class="Italic">Kile v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 104 MSPR 49, 50-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 11-19 2006 MSPB 330 (2006) (following remand, 107 MSPR 160, 2007 MSPB 260 (2007)), and instead of deciding the issue of law, remanded the appeal for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, an Instrument Mechanic, WG-10, applied for and was appointed to the position of Equipment Specialist, GS-7, effective May 1, 2005. The rate of pay for the appellant's new GS position was $50,782.00, which included a locality adjustment of $5,327.00 and retained pay. The agency subsequently informed the appellant that he was not entitled to a locality adjustment in addition to retained pay, and withdrew the appellant's locality pay adjustment of $5,327.00, retroactive to May 1, 2005, thus reducing his pay to $45,455.00.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed to the Board, claiming that the agency had improperly reduced him in pay or grade. The agency responded that, as a result of the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) May 31, 2005 interim regulations, which were made retroactively effective to May 1, 2005, implementing the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act of 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-411, 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. (118 Stat.) 2305 (the Act), the appellant was not entitled to a locality adjustment in addition to retained pay. Specifically, the agency stated, "Through an amendment to 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 5302, locality payments under 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 5304 will no longer be paid on top of a retained rate." The agency argued that, although the Board generally has jurisdiction over reductions in pay or grade, the Board does not have jurisdiction in those instances where the agency reduced an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." The agency argued that the appellant's loss of locality pay was therefore not appealable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument that he suffered an appealable loss in pay or grade. The appellant responded that the vacancy announcement for the GS-7 Equipment Specialist position, under which he applied and was selected, stated that the salary for the position would include locality pay. The appellant further explained that, in the new position, he was paid $24.33 per hour (base pay plus locality pay), and that his previous base pay was $21.78 per hour. The appellant argued that he relied on the agency's representations to his detriment and that he wished to be reinstated to his previous position of Instrument Mechanic, WG-10, with appropriate back pay for missed overtime since May 1, 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he issue before the Board is whether it has jurisdiction to consider the appellant's loss of a locality adjustment as a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Pay" is defined in chapter 75 as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). Furthermore, OPM has defined "pay" for purposes of chapter 75 as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee, that is, the rate of pay before any deductions and <span class="Italic">exclusive of additional pay of any kind</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) (emphasis added). Based on this regulatory provision, it appears that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's loss of locality pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Previously, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.202 also defined "rate of basic pay" as "the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee before any deductions and <span class="Italic">exclusive of additional pay of any kind</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.202 (2005) (emphasis added). The Act, however, which was passed on October 30, 2004, and which took effect 180 days later (i.e., on April 29, 2005), statutorily redefined "rate of basic pay" within the context of grade and pay retention to include locality pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N.

In addition, pursuant to OPM's May 31, 2005 implementation of section 301 of the Act, OPM issued interim regulations, which were made retroactively effective to May 1, 2005, that redefined "rate of basic pay" for GS employees to include, in part, a locality rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 70 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that the loss of locality pay, as an addition to basic pay, was not an appealable reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Shifflett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (1999). In <span class="Italic">Shifflett</span>, the Board <span id="Page_345"></span>applied the pre-Act definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. part 531 in determining that the loss of locality pay is not an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board, however, did not explain in <span class="Italic">Shifflett</span> why it did not apply the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. part 752. Regardless, the result in <span class="Italic">Shifflett</span> would have been the same given that the language in the two regulatory provisions was then identical. Therefore, <span class="Italic">Shifflett</span> does not foreclose the application of the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. part 752 to the present case. The parties, however, have not had an opportunity to address the discrepancy between 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) and the newly enacted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203. As a result, the appeal is remanded to provide the parties with an opportunity to address these regulatory provisions and to submit evidence and argument regarding which regulation governs in the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the AJ determines on remand that the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) governs the present appeal, the appellant's loss of locality pay is not an appealable adverse action. If, however, the AJ concludes that the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 applies, it is necessary to further develop the factual record in order to determine whether the Board may, for the following reasons, have jurisdiction to consider the appellant's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule is that a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). An exception to this rule is when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Hall v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1997); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Transportation</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 560, 565 (1984). As noted above, the agency argued below that, pursuant to OPM's regulatory interpretation of the Act, an employee may not receive both locality pay and a retained rate of pay, and that the appellant's receipt of locality pay was therefore contrary to law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction over his appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . An employee makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction by establishing that his rate of basic pay was reduced since, by statute, such an action is appealable. <span class="Italic">See Royster v. Department of Defense</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998); <span class="Italic">Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559-60 (1998). If the agency reduced the employee's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, then the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Royster</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 559-60. An employee should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his pay, since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the employee's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">See Royster</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 559-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant's pay was reduced from $50,782.00 to $45,455.00 to eliminate locality pay. If the AJ determines that the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 governs here, the appellant has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction by establishing that his rate of basic pay as redefined by the Act was reduced. The agency would then bear the burden of showing that it originally set the appellant's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Royster</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10; <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 559-60. The parties' submissions fail to provide a sufficient factual basis upon which to determine whether the agency properly set the appellant's pay as required by the retained pay regulations in 5 C.F.R. part 536 subject to the maximum-payable-rate rule at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.221, particularly given that the term "rate of basic pay" now specifically includes locality pay under the definitions provision at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 pursuant to OPM's regulatory interpretation of the Act. For example, the agency's argument below and on review that it was merely correcting an erroneous rate of pay is not, in and of itself, evidence. <span class="Italic">See Hendricks v. Department of the Navy</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 163, 168 (1995) (statements of a party's representative in a pleading do not constitute evidence). In addition, the SF-50 that purports to document the agency's correction of the appellant's pay cites "Reg 335.102 Comp" as legal authority for the change. The agency has not provided any explanation of this reference. If, for example, the agency is referring to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102, which concerns an agency's general authority to promote, demote, or reassign certain employees, it is not clear how this provision supports the agency's contention that the appellant's pay was initially set at a rate contrary to law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, this is a case of first impression with regard to the implications of the Act and OPM's extensive revisions to its pay administration regulations, including the impact of the discrepancy between the definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) and OPM's revised definition of "rate of basic pay" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203. Assuming that, on remand, the AJ determines that the part 531 definition of "pay" is applicable in this appeal, the record as it exists is insufficient with regard to the agency's burden of production concerning its initial calculation of the appellant's pay in the GS-7 Equipment Specialist position. <span class="Italic">See Mulligan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 12 (1999). Therefore, the AJ shall, if he reaches this issue, further develop the record on this matter. In addition, given that the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proof on this jurisdictional issue, he must be afforded the opportunity to rebut any showing that the agency may make concerning its initial calculation of the appellant's pay in the GS-7 Equipment Specialist position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the 2007 Board decision denying the agency's PFR from the remand decision in <span class="Italic">Kile</span>, the Board did not explain the reasoning followed by the AJ, who ruled that the appellant was constructively demoted when he relied on incorrect information provided by the agency in taking a new position to retain his locality pay.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4), reduction in pay is appealable to the Board. Pay is defined in chapter 75 as the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that the loss of locality pay, as an addition to basic pay, was not an appealable reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Shifflett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 472, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (1999).

Therefore, <span class="Italic">Shifflett</span> does not foreclose the application of the definition of rate of basic pay in 5 C.F.R. part 752 to the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question presented here is what is meant by "pay" in chapter 75 of Title 5. The starting point for every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. Where the statutory language is clear, it must control absent clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Aralar v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). As stated previously, pay is defined in chapter 75 as the rate of basic pay fixed by <span class="Italic">law or administrative action</span> for the position held by an employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enacting the Workforce Flexibility Act, Congress statutorily redefined rate of basic pay within the context of grade and pay retention to include locality pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2004 U.S.C.C.A.N. (118 Stat). 2305, 2315-16, 2318; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5361(4)(A)(i), 5363 note. I therefore find that "rate of pay" within the meaning of Title 5 must, following enactment of the Workforce Flexibility Act, necessarily include locality pay. To hold otherwise would preclude an employee from appealing a reduction in a rate of pay fixed by law, inasmuch as the Workforce Flexibility Act is now law and specifically incorporates locality pay into the definition of "rate of basic pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When reading Title 5 in this light, OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(f) is not inconsistent for it also defines "pay" as the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action," while clarifying that such rate is the rate of pay before any deductions and exclusive of additional pay of any kind. "Additional" referring to any type of pay not included in the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action. Since locality pay is now included in the rate of basic pay fixed by law, it cannot be consider "additional" pay, such as overtime, night differential, and the like, which are not. Accordingly, I find that the definition of rate of basic pay in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203 applies as that provision implements the change in the definition of "rate of basic pay" included in the Workforce Flexibility Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On September 18, 2008, OPM proposed rules at 73 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Stone's alleged loss of FQA pay is "additional pay" not subject to MSPB review, the Board correctly held that it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Stone's appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203. Moreover, Mr. Stone's FQA was not "fixed by law or administrative action" as proscribed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4)--it was discretionary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5922(a) ("allowances...authorized by this subchapter <span class="Italic">may</span> be granted to an employee officially stationed in a foreign area" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">see also Roberts v.

Accordingly, Mr. Stone's loss of FQA is not an appealable "reduction in pay" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), and the Board did not err in dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board also lacked jurisdiction to review the Agency's debt collection procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constructive denial of a pay increase was beyond Board jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Goettmann v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 95, 96-97 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The five appellants in these cases were changed from wage grade positions to GS-5 training instructor positions, under the agency's upward mobility program, and were entitled to and received a retained rate of pay under 5 USC 5363. After completion of a one-year training program, appellants were promoted to GS-7 with no increase in salary, due to continued salary retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants appealed the denial of a pay increase by the agency, contending that they were reduced in pay. Specifically, appellants argued that they were entitled to an increase in salary of not less than two steps above the GS-5 position from which they were promoted, pursuant to 5 USC 5334(b). The presiding official, in separate decisions, dismissed the appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He determined that there was no reduction from the amount allotted to the appellants prior to the promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their petitions, appellants reiterate their contention that the agency's denial of their statutory entitlement under 5 USC 5334(b) was a reduction in pay over which the Board has jurisdiction under 5 USC 7512. However, they provide no authority for this argument, urging merely that "a denial of an entitlement is no less objectionable than a withdrawal of a benefit." This is insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction on the Board. Appellants' complaint is based on a perceived failure by the agency to obey the mandates of 5 USC 5334(b), pertaining to Subchapter III General Schedule pay rates, and their desired remedy is pay adjustment under that subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants' argument that the agency in effect imposed a constructive reduction in pay upon them is unsupported and unsupportable. Constructive pay reductions, like speculative pay reductions, do not fall within the purview of its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span>, <span class="Italic">Peele v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPB 253, 6 MSPR 296 (1981); <span class="Italic">Wilcox v. The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency</span>, 6 MSPB 264, 6 MSPR 310 (1981). Absent an actual loss of pay, the Board cannot, and here does not, intimate an opinion on the merits of appellants' claimed entitlements under the pay rate regulations of Subchapter III.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants have not shown that an appealable adverse action has been effected in these cases such as would confer jurisdiction upon the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Peele v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 296, 299 (1981), noted in <span class="Italic">Goettmann,</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's argument that he has suffered a reduction in pay is similarly specious. Since the position to which appellant was reassigned still compensates him as a GS-17, it is obvious that his pay has not been reduced. Appellant's contention that a reduction in pay does not have to connote an actual loss since pay is defined by 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(4) as the rate of basic pay fixed by law overlooks the subsequent words of that statute. 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(4) states that "'pay' means the rate of basic pay fixed by law <span class="Italic">or administrative action</span> for the position held by an employee." (emphasis supplied.) Thus, appellant's current pay, fixed by administrative action at the same rate as before his reassignment, which rate had been limited by law, precluded a finding that his pay has been reduced. Similarly, appellant's complaint that his reassignment deprives him of the possible future benefit of periodic step increases must fail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also cited in <span class="Italic">Goettmann</span> was <span class="Italic">Wilcox v. Arms Control &#x0026; Disarmament Agency</span>, 6 MSPR 310, 311-12 (1981):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the petitioner speculates that his pay may not be increased to the same level or at the same rate as increases applicable to employees under the General Schedule and that any appeal at that time could be untimely, we reviewed this issue, and the specific authority relied on by appellant, in our decision issued today in <span class="Italic">Peele v.
