<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-16"><span class="space">a.</span> National Guard, Other Uniformed Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before a statutory change, <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 327, 328-32 (1989), determined that service credit was not earned through Army National Guard training unless the employee is ordered to active duty in "the service of the United States":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant seeks service credit for ten weeks of training with the Massachusetts National Guard performed for two weeks in each of the years from 1948 through 1952. OPM initially denied credit for the service and reaffirmed its denial in its reconsideration decision issued on May 31, 1988. On appeal, the administrative judge sustained OPM's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that the appellant bears the burden of proof to show that his service is creditable. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 9 M.S.P.R. 122, 125 (1981). He found that the appellant had not established that his regular yearly training with the National Guard constituted "military service" within the definition of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13) because it was training performed while in a state government status and not in the service of the United States. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 501-505 pertaining to the National Guard. He rejected the appellant's contention that his National Guard training was creditable because he was ordered to duty under the auspices of the President and he received federal pay....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sole issue for resolution in this appeal is whether the appellant's service with the National Guard is creditable towards the computation of his civil service retirement annuity. Under certain circumstances, military service is creditable towards a civil service retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c). Thus, the question in this appeal is whether the appellant's service constitutes military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13) "military service" includes service in the armed forces but "does not include service in the National Guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the United States." The appellant claims credit for his weeks of service with the Army National Guard; the record does not, however, establish that he was "ordered to active duty in the service of the United States."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reconsideration decision, OPM noted that service credit may not be allowed for National Guard service when it is performed "while in a State Government status; such noncreditable service is generally performed under provisions of title 32, U.S. Code [pertaining to the National Guard]." OPM quoted a letter of May 3, 1984, from the Adjutant General's Office, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which stated with reference to the appellant, "please be advised that your Annual Training periods while a <span id="Page_4110"></span>member of the MassARNG [Army National Guard] were under Title 32 USC 505."<span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also relied on a letter of May 5, 1969, directed to an official of its Bureau of Retirement and Insurance by a Legal Advisor with the Department of the Army and the Air Force National Guard Bureau. This letter sets forth the Department's view of noncreditable National Guard service as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">What is excluded from entitlement to credit is (a) service performed by members of the National Guard, in response to orders of State authorities for State service and entitlement to State pay, e.g. the Maryland National Guard at Cambridge, the Michigan National Guard at Detroit prior to being called into Federal service, and (b) annual field training and other full time training duty performed by these Guardsmen in State status, in conformity to 32 U.S.C. 502-505, for which they are entitled to pay from the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM accordingly found that the appellant was not entitled to credit because his training was under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 505, and he, therefore, was in a state government as opposed to a federal or United States status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge sustained this conclusion. He considered the appellant's assertion that he was entitled to credit because he was ordered to training under the auspices of the President, and he received federal pay. He, however, noted the letter of May 5, 1969, from the National Guard Bureau and an additional letter of August 25, 1970, from the Legal Advisor, Department of the Army and the Air Force National Guard Bureau, reaffirming its earlier conclusion regarding entitlement to service credit. In addition, the administrative judge considered the May 3, 1984, letter from the Adjutant General. He further noted that the orders issued to the appellant indicated that he was ordered to training under Title 32 as opposed to Title 10 of the United States Code because they were issued by the Adjutant General's Office of the "Commonwealth of Massachusetts," and the appellant's unit was "not called to active duty' rather his unit of the Guard is directed to 'field training.'" Thus, he found that the preponderant evidence of record established that the appellant was in a state as opposed to a federal status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of this conclusion, we note that the statutory scheme provides for a National Guard that is primarily defined in terms of state control, even though its authorization is Federal. National Guard is defined in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(9)&#x2003;"National Guard" means the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(10)&#x2003;"Army National Guard" means that part of the organized militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone, and the District of Columbia, active and inactive, that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;is a land force;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;is trained, and has its officers appointed, under the sixteenth clause of section 8, article I, of the Constitution;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;is organized, armed, and equipped wholly or partly at Federal expense; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;is federally recognized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 501(b) provides that: "The training of the National Guard shall be conducted by the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, the Canal Zone and the District of Columbia in conformity with this title." Section 505 provides that: "Under such regulations as the President may prescribe and upon the recommendation of the governor of any State or Territory, Puerto Rico, or the Canal Zone, or of the commanding general of the National Guard of the District of Columbia," the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force may authorize members of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard to attend a service school, or be attached to an organization of the Army or Air Force for "routine practice instruction"..."during field training or other outdoor exercises."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant does not dispute the fact that his field training was under state auspices or that he was a member of the Army National Guard as opposed to a member of the Army National Guard of the United States which is a "reserve component of the Army all of whose members are members of the Army National Guard."<span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(11). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 261 defining the Army National Guard of the United States as one of the "reserve components of the armed forces." If the appellant had been a member of the reserves, his field training would have been under the auspices of the federal government; however, he was a member of the National Guard serving under the auspices of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. While a State National Guard unit is subject to federal control, including receiving appropriations from federal funds to support the unit, in times of peace, the National Guard unit remains a component of the State and the members thereof are employed by the State. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. United States,</span> 189 F.2d 607 (10th Cir. 1951); <span class="Italic">Satcher v. United States,</span> 101 F. Supp. 919 (W.D. S.C. 1952).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is at least one circumstance when Army National Guard members who are not members of the reserves are considered to be performing a federal function for which their service is creditable as military service. This is when they are "called" to active duty by the President of the United States pursuant to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3500 (to repel invaders or quell rebellions) or other "call" provisions. The record does not show, and the appellant does not assert, however, that his training orders were for such a purpose. Rather, the record shows that his training was performed exclusively for a state under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 505 and is not creditable. <span class="Italic">See also</span> Federal Personnel Manual Supplement, 831-1, S3-6(a)(3)-(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also again asserts in his petition for review, that he was denied due process and equal protection under the law because reservists may have their training time credited for civilian retirement purposes as federal military service. The administrative judge relying upon <span class="Italic">Malone</span> concluded that the Board is "without authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes, whether they are alleged to be unconstitutional in their design or application."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held in <span class="Italic">Malone</span> that "administrative agencies are without authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes."<span class="Italic">Malone</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. at 406. The Board, however, held in <span class="Italic">May v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 534 (1988), that although it is without authority to determine the constitutionality of statutes, it "has the authority to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to an agency's application of a statute." But the appellant here does not raise such a question of statutory applicability. He is not claiming that he was treated differently from other members of the Army National Guard but rather that members of the Army National Guard of the United States, as members of the reserve component of the Army, are treated differently from members of the Army National Guard who are not members of the reserves. Thus, he does not challenge a specific statutory application but instead an entire statutory scheme or design affording different rights and benefits to reservists and nonreservists. We are without authority to consider the constitutionality of the statutorily mandated differences between these two groups.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, conclude that OPM correctly determined that the appellant's service with the National Guard was not creditable towards his civil service retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGrath v. OPM</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-2187.OPINION.5-29-2020_1595778.pdf">810 Fed. Appx. 882</a>, 883-84 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), added definition for covered National Guard service in a FERS case, determining that time spent by Mr. McGrath in the National Guard was not credited for his civil service retirement since he was not formally ordered into federal service, pursuant to Title 10, by the President or other federal authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McGrath served honorably in the United States Army from July 1, 1968 to April 7, 1976. Mr. McGrath then served a total of 87 days in the Army National Guard of Connecticut between 1977 and 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its initial decision of March 28, 2018, OPM found that Mr. McGrath was not entitled to receive credit for his National Guard service in the computation of his FERS annuity. OPM affirmed this finding in a final decision on August 22, 2018. In that final decision, OPM stated that Mr. McGrath's National Guard service was not creditable because it was not "performed under either a 'call' by the President or an 'order' by the Secretary of State."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 13, 2019, the Administrative Judge affirmed OPM's final decision. <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., No. DC-0841-18-0798-I-1 (M.S.P.B. June 13, 2019). In her decision, the Administrative Judge explained that service in the National Guard was ordinarily not creditable "military service" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8411(c)(1), which provides such credit for "each period of military service." The statutory definition of "military service" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31) excludes service in the National Guard, "except when ordered to active duty in the service of the United States or full-time National Guard duty (as such term is defined in section 101(d) of title 10) if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38 that occurs on or after August 1, 1990." The second exception, for full-time National Guard duty, applies only to service performed after August 1, 1990. The Administrative Judge found that this exception thus did not apply to Mr. McGrath's service in 1977 and 1978. Mr. McGrath does not contest this finding on appeal. The Administrative Judge then determined that Mr. McGrath's service in the National Guard also did not fit within the first exception, being ordered to active duty in service of the United States. The Administrative Judge held that, for the service to be creditable under the first exception, Mr. McGrath was required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that either he or his unit was formally called into service by the President or the Army National Guard of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McGrath argues that the Board misinterpreted the governing statutes when it determined under what circumstances service in the National Guard would be creditable. Specifically, Mr. McGrath argues that the Board improperly interpreted 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12602, which concerns general <span id="Page_4111"></span>compensation and benefits for members of the Army National Guard of the United States. Mr. McGrath argues that the 87 days of service at issue should be considered "in Federal service as a Reserve of the Army" under either &#x00A7; 12602(a)(1) or (2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its final decision, the Board considered &#x00A7; 12602 but determined that it did not relieve Mr. McGrath of the requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31). That section provides definitions specific to FERS and explicitly states that creditable military service "does not include service in the National Guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the United States." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board's interpretation. The provisions of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12602(a) do not render creditable, for purposes of FERS, National Guard service that does not fit within the exceptions provided by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(31). Section 12602 concerns benefits for reserve components of the Army. Definitions for those purposes may differ from definitions for purposes of FERS, a civil service retirement system governed by chapter 84 of Title 5. If, as Mr. McGrath asserts, members of the Army National Guard are always deemed to be in federal service by virtue of their continuous membership in the Army National Guard of the United States, even when serving as members of the Army National Guard of a state, there could be no National Guard duty that is <span class="Italic">not</span> in federal service--and &#x00A7; 8401(31)'s requirement that creditable National Guard service be "in the service of the United States" would be mere surplusage. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12401 ("Members of the Army National Guard of the United States and the Air National Guard of the United States are not in active Federal service except when ordered thereto under law.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board did not err in holding that Mr. McGrath must show that, for the 87 days in dispute, he was formally ordered into federal service, pursuant to Title 10, by the President or other federal authority. <span class="Italic">Clark v. United States</span>, 322 F.3d 1358, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (holding that "members of the National Guard only serve the federal military when they are formally called into the military service of the United States" (citing <span class="Italic">Perpich v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 496 U.S. 334 (1990))). Other courts have consistently drawn the same distinction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1366-68 (collecting cases). Substantial evidence supports the Board's factual finding that neither Mr. McGrath nor his unit were formally called into federal service during the 87 days at issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of a statutory change, qualifying service as a National Guard technician became creditable with a deposit, <span class="Italic">Tate v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 57, 59-60 &#x00B6; 8, 2008 MSPB 115 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until 1990, service under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 was creditable toward a CSRS annuity only if the individual had performed such service after December 31, 1968. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Retirement Benefits: National Guard Technicians, Pub. L. No. 101-530, &#x00A7; 1, 104 Stat. 2338 (1990). As noted above, the appellant's service under that statutory provision was performed entirely before that date. In 1990, Congress enacted legislation providing that an individual could obtain CSRS credit for service under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709 even if the individual's service under that provision occurred entirely before 1969. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Credit for this service can be obtained, however, only if the individual "makes an appropriate deposit...." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 3(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Only service after 1969 is creditable for National Guard Technicians, according to <span class="Italic">Coombs v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 473, 474-75 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis of the applicable statutes reveals that under the law effective prior to January 1, 1969, appellant was an employee of the state of Utah, and was not entitled to service credit for his National Guard service prior to January 1, 1969. Therefore, the Act merely conferred a new benefit to individuals employed by the National Guard on that date. Because appellant's service ended in 1955, he receives no benefit from the Act and his service is not creditable for retirement purposes.</p>
