<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-190"><span class="space">k.</span> Inappropriate or Disruptive Statement Not Charged as Threat</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency need not prove its case under <span class="Italic">Metz</span> standards if it does not charge the employee with making a threat. If the agency charges misconduct through a different characterization, that charge, although having some similarity to the charge of a threat, may be sustained on a lesser burden of proof than that required by <span class="Italic">Metz,</span> and the penalty is assessed according to the seriousness of the conduct. An analogy can be drawn to sexual misconduct cases. <span class="Italic">Wiley v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/WILEY_MICHAEL_DA_0752_05_0539_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247273.pdf">102 MSPR 535</a>, 540-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-19, 2006 MSPB 206 (2006), explained the basis for an alternative, and lesser, charging theory in a threat-like case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, in deciding whether statements constitute threats, the Board is to apply the reasonable person standard, considering (1) the listeners' reactions; (2) the listeners' apprehensions; (3) the speaker's intent; (4) any conditional nature of the statements; and (5) the attendant circumstances. <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, 780 F.2d at 1002. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198 (1997), in support of its contention that the administrative judge erred by applying the five-part "threats" test set forth in <span class="Italic">Metz</span>. Relying on <span class="Italic">Otero,</span> the agency argues that, because it charged the appellant with "Improper Conduct/Violation of the Zero Tolerance Policy," and did not specifically charge the appellant with making threats, it was not required to prove that it met the criteria in <span class="Italic">Metz.</span> We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is required to review an agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). "Nothing in law or regulation requires that an agency affix a label to a charge of misconduct." <span class="Italic">Otero</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 202. The agency "may simply describe actions that constitute the misbehavior in a narrative form, and have its discipline sustained if the efficiency of the service suffers because of the misconduct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, if the agency chooses to label an action of alleged misconduct, then it must prove the elements that make up the legal definition of the charge, if any. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency chose to charge the appellant with improper conduct for violating a provision of its zero tolerance policy. That provision prohibits any "actual, implied or veiled threat, made seriously or in jest" and states that "[a]ny form or manner of threatening or provoking remarks or threatening gestures in the workplace is unacceptable." This provision contains a lesser burden of proof than the <span class="Italic">Metz</span> test because it does not require that the agency prove that the appellant intended to cause harm or that any listeners felt threatened by the alleged statements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to the administrative judge's findings, the agency was not required to prove that the appellant's statement constituted a "true threat" under <span class="Italic">Metz</span>, but only that his statement constituted improper conduct in violation of the zero tolerance policy. <span class="Italic">See Otero,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 202-04; <span class="Italic">see also Taylor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (the agency did not charge the appellant with assault and, therefore, was not required to prove intent, even though the agency properly considered the behavior as "assaultive" in its penalty determination), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 175 Fed. Appx. 335 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (NP); <span class="Italic">Cross v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 7-9 (2001) (finding that the administrative judge erred by requiring the agency to prove the elements of falsification when it had charged the appellant with "conduct unbecoming" for changing information in a subordinate's evaluation report and signing the report for another individual without authorization to do so); <span class="Italic">cf. Tyler v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 85, 89-90 (1988) (an agency must meet Title VII's standards of proof when it has explicitly charged an employee with violating that law, but it need not meet those standards when its action rests on its own valid policy or rules). Here, there is no indication that the agency acted improperly in charging the appellant with the general charge of improper conduct/violating the zero tolerance policy. Thus, the administrative judge should have analyzed the charge as written by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the lesser standard in this case, we find that the agency has proven its charge by preponderant evidence. The record establishes that, on September 23, 2004, after being advised to stop harassing Lupoe, the appellant commented that he should go and get his gun and shoot up the place. In addition, the appellant himself admitted that he said, "[I]f I lose my job, what am [I] supposed to do, want to kill her...?" We find that the appellant violated the agency's zero tolerance policy, irrespective of his argument that none of the individuals who heard his comments took them seriously or felt threatened. As discussed above, the zero tolerance policy does not require that any listeners feel apprehension or fear; it only requires that the appellant utter an "actual, implied or veiled threat, made seriously or in jest." The appellant's statements fall squarely within the purview of the zero tolerance policy and constitute a violation of that policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to proving the charge against the appellant, the agency must show that the action taken promoted the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). We find that a nexus exists because the charge that was sustained, i.e., violation of the zero tolerance policy on violence in the workplace, was serious and adversely impacted the agency's mission of providing service to its customers and a safe environment for its employees. <span class="Italic">See Guise v. Department of Justice,</span> 330 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (the agency established nexus by showing that the appellant's conduct made it more difficult to maintain facility safety); <span class="Italic">Battle v. Department of Transportation</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 403, 410 (1994) (behavior that affects the agency's obligation to maintain a safe workplace impinges on the efficiency of the service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). Where, as here, the agency's <span id="Page_2696"></span>charge is sustained, the Board will modify an agency-imposed penalty only when it finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or the penalty imposed clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Jacoby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 554, &#x00B6; 15 (2000). Here, the deciding official, Carl J. Iannazzo, who had been in his position for a little over 6 months when he removed the appellant, failed to appropriately consider the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Although his letter of decision and a small portion of his direct testimony indicate that he considered factors such as the seriousness of the offense, the appellant's 8 years of service, and whether there were any other mitigating factors, the majority of his hearing testimony makes it overwhelmingly clear that he did not give serious consideration to any penalty other than removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Iannazzo's position that removal is the proper penalty for any violation of the zero tolerance policy, without any real consideration of a lesser penalty, is contrary to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Omites v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 11 (2000). Therefore, the agency's penalty determination is not entitled to our deference, and we must independently weigh the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to evaluate the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (no deference is owed to an agency's penalty determination where it failed to weigh the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In selecting a reasonable penalty, the Board must "consider, first and foremost, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or was frequently repeated." <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 127, 135 (1997). In this case, we find the statements made by the appellant to be very serious, especially in light of the climate in which the agency operates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the seriousness of the offense, we will also consider the reaction of Lupoe, the apparent target of the appellant's statement about killing "her" if he lost his job, despite the fact that his statements were relayed to her by other individuals. Lupoe testified that she was "frightened because [she] didn't know if it was a serious threat" and she had to leave the workplace after she was told what the appellant had said because she "didn't know if he was going to come back and shoot or anything...." Lupoe further related that she had to seek counseling because of the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not present any evidence that the appellant had been involved in any prior disciplinary actions or misconduct before this incident. Thus, the appellant appears to have had 8 years of unblemished agency service at the time of his removal. We find, however, that these mitigating factors are outweighed, not only by the seriousness of the offense, but by the appellant's failure to take responsibility for his misconduct and his lack of remorse. <span class="Italic">See Render v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 441, &#x00B6; 17 (2001) (considering lack of remorse in a penalty determination and finding that the appellant's failure to recognize that her acts were improper demonstrates that she lacks rehabilitation potential). At the hearing, the appellant continued to deny stating that he "felt like getting his gun and shooting up the place," even when confronted with the testimony of his "friend," Elias, who stated that she specifically heard him make that statement. He went on to admit, however, that he did ask Elias, "[I]f I lose my job, what am [I] supposed to do, want to kill her?" We find that this statement provides a greater justification for the removal penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we find that the penalty of removal is within the bounds of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disruption in the workplace, not a threat, sustained an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-15-0049-I-1 (NP 11/2/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In connection with the 30-day suspension, the appellant alleges on review that, although the agency charged him with causing disruption in the workplace, the underlying charge was that he made a threat which the agency was then required to prove, but that his remarks did not rise to that level. He points to the notice of proposed removal wherein the proposing official stated that "[t]he fact that you threatened to get even not only with the employee, but her family with whom you have no personal relationship, is unsettling." In determining how adverse action charges are to be construed, the Board will examine the structure and language of the proposal notice. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). Here, the charge in question was causing a disruption in the workplace, and the narrative description of the actions that constitute the charged misconduct explains why, in the agency's view, the appellant's statements disrupted the workplace. Despite the proposing official's lone statement elsewhere in the notice, we find that, taken as a whole and considering the entire proposal notice, the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat and therefore was not required to prove that his statements constituted a threat. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 28 (2007). For that reason, we also reject the appellant's claim that the agency denied him due process or committed harmful procedural error in denying him the right to respond to the threat charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hicks v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-16-0105-I-1 (NP 9/22/2016), distinguished a charge of a threat and a more general charge involving impairment of service efficiency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming without finding that the deciding official relied on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information when she considered the appellant's alleged misconduct as a threat charge the proposal notice informed the appellant that the agency charged her with conduct prejudicial to the best interests of the service. This contains a lesser burden of proof than a threat charge because it does not require an agency to establish that the appellant intended to cause harm or that any listeners felt threatened by the alleged statements or actions at issue. <span class="Italic">See Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6; 10 (2006) (finding that an improper conduct charge contains a lesser burden of proof than a threat charge), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 218 F.

Department of the Treasury</span>, 780 F.2d 1001, 1004 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-13 Health Systems Administrator, had been experiencing difficulties for some time with pay and leave matters, apparently because of a disagreement she had with management as to whether her work schedule required her to work a set tour of duty each day. She had filed numerous equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaints over these issues. On May 2, 2014, she went to see the Chief, Medical Expense Performance Reporting System, regarding these matters. During the meeting, the appellant expressed concerns about how her supervisors had been treating her, became visibly upset, and, according to the Chief, made some disturbing comments, including that she worked in a toxic environment with toxic leadership and that she had written to her Congressman, asking "Must more blood [&#8197;] be shed before changes occur?"[2] She asked the Chief if she recalled the shootings at Camp Lejeune and Fort Hood.[3] After the appellant left, because the appellant's demeanor caused her concern, the Chief called her own supervisor, relating that the appellant had mentioned that her first- and second-level supervisors needed to be mindful or careful and leave her alone. At the Chief's supervisor's suggestion, the Chief began to prepare a memorandum for the record. The appellant returned to the Chief's office on May 5, 2014, seeking to explain what she had meant by blood being shed, stating that her family was bleeding because of the issues with her pay. In the Chief's view, the appellant was not upset this time, but rather serious and very resolved, and, because this made the Chief nervous, she contacted security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In that April 7, 2014 letter, the appellant stated that she was being targeted for mistreatment, harassed, and abused and that her life was in danger. She also asked "Is blood shed required to stop the abuse? I hope the answer is 'No!'" She attached a newspaper article about the Fort Hood shooting, on which she had typed several sentences urging the Congressman to read her documents and stating, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "thoughtless actions (or in-actions) taken by military leaders are often where the deadly tragedies begin" and "let's stop the violence!"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The latter event had occurred just a few weeks earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 16, 2014, the agency proposed to remove the appellant for Conduct Unbecoming a Federal Employee-making inflammatory and/or menacing comments reasonably placing fellow employees in fear. After the appellant submitted a written response, the agency issued a decision finding the charge sustained and warranting the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant claimed that her words were taken out of context and that she never threatened anyone, but instead was seeking to prevent outbreaks of violence at military installations. She argued that the charge was not properly "classified" and that removal was too severe a penalty, and she requested a hearing. She later alleged that the agency's action was in retaliation for her protected EEO activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant first questions the administrative judge's reliance on the testimony of her supervisors that her comments were disturbing since neither was present when she made the comments. However, inasmuch as the appellant has not denied making the statements, her supervisors' reactions to them are no less valid simply because they did not hear them firsthand. The appellant's first-line supervisor, the proposing official, testified that, when he learned of the comments, he found them very disturbing, perceiving that they were directed at him and some of his staff. The appellant's second-line supervisor, the deciding official, testified that, in her view, the incident involved the safety and security of the facility and the patients for whom she is responsible and that she felt <span id="Page_2697"></span>it was appropriate to immediately notify the authorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the Chief to whom she made the comments testified that she reported them as a precaution, not because she thought they represented an immediate threat. The testimony to which the appellant refers occurred during an EEO hearing. During the Board hearing, however, the Chief testified that she reported the comments to her supervisor and to the police because she did perceive a threat. Because the agency did not charge the appellant with making a threat, the referenced discrepancy in the Chief's testimonies is not significant. She consistently described the appellant as upset, crying, visibly shaken, and very nervous during their meeting, and her own reaction as being very rattled, so much so that she called her supervisor and prepared a memorandum for the record. The Chief further testified that she remained concerned when the appellant returned to see her a few days later, that, after she left, the Chief asked a male colleague and her staff to let security know if the appellant again returned, and that she herself contacted security, an action she had never taken in her 25 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues on review that the administrative judge ignored testimony from two individuals who did not believe the appellant was threatening violence by her comments. Those two witnesses were the Criminal Investigator from the Police Provost Marshal's Office who determined that no "communicated threat" had been made, and a colleague of the appellant's who did not perceive her written comments as a threat, but rather as a "normal" response to the "way she was being treated," First, the administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that she did not consider it in reaching her decision. <span class="Italic">Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). In any event, the Criminal Investigator's role was to determine whether the appellant had made a threat as defined and prohibited by Federal law, not to decide if there was cause to remove her from her position. And, the appellant's colleague is not in the appellant's supervisory chain, and thus her position on the significance of the appellant's comments is simply an opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency established the conduct unbecoming charge by proving that the appellant committed the acts in support of the broad label, <span class="Italic">Canada v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 9 (2010), and therefore she has not shown that the administrative judge erred in sustaining the charge against her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that removal is a reasonable penalty for the sustained charge. In this regard, the appellant first contends that her alleged misconduct was mischaracterized as conduct unbecoming a Federal employee, which carries a penalty of a 1-day suspension to removal for a first offense, whereas it should have been characterized as creating a disturbance resulting in an adverse effect on morale, which carries a penalty from a written reprimand to a 5-day suspension for a first offense, or threatening or attempting to inflict bodily harm without bodily contact, which carries a penalty from a written reprimand to a 14-day suspension for a first offense. It is well established, however, that the Board is <span id="Page_2698"></span>required to review the agency's decision on an adverse action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency and may not substitute what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 4 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that, in determining to impose removal, the deciding official failed to consider mitigating factors. Where, as here, the Board sustains an agency's charge, it will defer to the agency's penalty determination unless the penalty exceeds the range of allowable punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Batten v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 9 (quoting <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 208 F. App'x 868 (Fed. Cir. 2006). That is because the employing agency, and not the Board, has primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency. <span class="Italic">Balouris v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6 (2008), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2008-3147, 2009 WL 405827 (Fed. Cir. 2009); <span class="Italic">Batten</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 9. The Board will not displace management's responsibility, but instead will ensure that managerial judgment has been exercised properly. <span class="Italic">Balouris</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Batten</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 9. Mitigation of an agency-imposed penalty is appropriate only where the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or where the agency's judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Balouris</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Batten</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 11. The deciding official need not show that he considered all the mitigating factors, and the Board will independently weigh the relevant factors only if the deciding official failed to demonstrate that he considered any specific, relevant mitigating factors before deciding on a penalty. <span class="Italic">Balouris</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Batten</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining to uphold the proposed penalty of removal, the deciding official weighed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, finding that: the appellant's remarks constituted a serious offense, causing reasonable fear to the Chief and her supervisors; despite the appellant's 22 years of civilian service, her performance had been unreliable during the rating year; she had lost the confidence of her supervisor and of key leadership; removal is within the range of penalties under the agency's Table of Penalties; the appellant's conduct reflected poorly on the morale of her coworkers; common sense dictates that her menacing comments were not acceptable, especially given the proximity in time to the mass shooting she referenced, and that, due to the sensitive nature of her comments, security was contacted and she was questioned by the Provost Marshal; her comments exemplify her inability to work with others and a lack of respect for authority and the safety and well-being of coworkers and patients, such that there was no reasonable potential for her rehabilitation; and there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to overcome the seriousness of her misconduct, and no alternative means to deter such misconduct in the future.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant asserts that the deciding official failed to consider the fact that she had significant service with no prior discipline, that there was tension between her and her supervisor, that she had sought, but been denied, "medical accommodation," that the incident was an isolated one, and that her performance was good or, in the alternative, not a relevant consideration. As noted, however, the deciding official did consider the appellant's 22 years of service. Although she did not acknowledge the tension that may have existed between the appellant and her supervisors, given that her numerous EEO complaints specifically named them, the deciding official did find that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to overcome the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct. Further, the record reflects that the agency did not deny, but rather determined to hold in abeyance, the appellant's request for accommodation, pending her return to work, and that, shortly afterwards, the agency proposed her removal. The fact that the appellant's misconduct was an isolated incident does not necessarily support the imposition of a lesser penalty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wiley v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 535, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 218 F. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2007). And, because the employee's past work record is a factor for consideration in a penalty determination, <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 305, it was not inappropriate for the deciding official to mention that the appellant's performance had been unreliable. In sum, we find that the agency weighed the relevant factors and that its judgment did not exceed the limits of reasonableness. Therefore, its penalty determination is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">Balouris,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 574, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Batten,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 222, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Jolly v. Dept. of Army</span>, 711 Fed. Appx. 620, 621, 623 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 2, 2014, Jolly met with Yolanda Kelly, Chief of Medical Expense Reporting System at Army Medical Center, to discuss this issue. According to Kelly, during that meeting, Jolly stated that she felt "she was being singled out,...intimidated and threatened," and asked Kelly "if she had heard about the [recent] Camp Lejeune and Fort Hood shootings." Jolly then stated that "her supervisor, and Col. Barrow, her second line supervisor, needed to be careful, to leave her alone and not to mess with her." Finally, Jolly stated that she had already written a letter to her Congressman about this issue. In that letter, Jolly attached a newspaper article about the Fort Hood shooting, and wrote that "[w]e need help stopping the violence....&#8197;If they do this to me, who else do you think they are doing this to[&#8197;]?&#8197;...Thoughtless actions (or in-actions) taken by military leaders are often where the deadly tragedies begin."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kelly described Jolly's demeanor as "visibly shaken[&#8197;] and very nervous." Based on this meeting, Kelly felt very concerned "because she...perceive[d] a threat," and alerted her own supervisor, Jolly's supervisors, and the police.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 5, 2014, Jolly returned to Kelly's office to explain what she had said. According to Kelly, Jolly stated that "her family was bleeding because of the issues with her pay." Kelly viewed Jolly's demeanor at this meeting to be "serious and very resolved." This again alarmed Kelly, and she contacted security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
