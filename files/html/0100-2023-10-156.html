<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-156"><span class="space">B.</span> TREATMENT OF BIAS ALLEGATIONS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulations provide the process for presenting and adjudicating disqualification motions, 5 CFR 1201.42 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;If a judge considers himself or herself disqualified, he or she will withdraw from the case, state on the record the reasons for doing so, and another judge will be promptly assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A party may file a motion asking the judge to withdraw on the basis of personal bias or other disqualification. This motion must be filed as soon as the party has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification. The reasons for the request must be set out in an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If the judge denies the motion, the party requesting withdrawal may request certification of the issue to the Board as an interlocutory appeal under &#x00A7; 1201.91 of this part. Failure to request certification is considered a waiver of the request for withdrawal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 3 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> contains the internal guidance to AJs, paralleling the regulations, providing the bases for disqualification of the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DISQUALIFICATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE</span>. The AJ may recuse himself or herself on the motion of a party or on the AJ's own motion. A party may file a motion asking the AJ to withdraw on the basis of personal bias or other disqualifying reason. If the AJ considers himself or herself disqualified, the AJ will withdraw from the case, state on the record the reasons for doing so, and another AJ will be assigned to the case. The CAJ must immediately notify ORO of an AJ's recusal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42. Bases for the disqualification of an AJ include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;A party, witness, or representative is a friend or relative of, or has had a close professional relationship with the AJ; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Personal bias or prejudice of the AJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Although the regulation requires that a party request that the AJ certify an interlocutory appeal to avoid waiver of the issue, absent extraordinary circumstances, a recusal motion is unlikely to warrant certification under the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92 (see chapter 6, <span class="Italic">infra</span>) because the law as to recusal for bias is settled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Department of the Army,</span> 287 F.3d 1358, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (an AJ's conduct during the course of a Board proceeding warrants a new adjudication only if the AJ's comments or actions evidence "a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible") (quoting <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> provides more detailed guidance to AJs concerning grounds and procedures for disqualification of an AJ. Although the <span class="Italic">Hearings Procedures Guide</span> has been superseded by the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>, it remains an excellent source for guidance and is still used for training and orientation. The <span class="Italic">Guide</span> states, at 38-42:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;Motion to Disqualify Administrative Judge</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are many grounds that an appellant or an agency might raise as grounds to disqualify the assigned AJ. Guidance as to the validity of such challenges can be found in the statute governing the disqualification of federal justices, judges or magistrates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 28 USC &#x00A7; 455, any justice, judge or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of this statute is to foster the appearance as well as the actuality of impartiality. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Potashnick v. Port City Construction Co.</span>, 609 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 820 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1432"></span>There is a presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators. <span class="Italic">Ibrahim v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 531 (1986); <span class="Italic">Marschner v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 24 MSPR 416 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Requirement of Judicial Impartiality</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board has determined that its AJs will hear and decide cases impartially. In ruling on disqualification motions, an AJ should consider himself bound by the tenets of due process of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">However, while litigants are entitled to a fair hearing, this does not necessarily mean a perfect one. Thus, an AJ's mistakes in connection with various pre-hearing, hearing and post-hearing rulings do not automatically indicate that he/she is biased or prejudiced. <span class="Italic">Garibay v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 327 (1987); <span class="Italic">Lavezza v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 27 MSPR 105 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Grounds for Disqualification</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There are certain generally recognized grounds for disqualification of any judge (whether an AJ or a Justice of the Supreme Court). Guidance as to those automatic grounds for disqualification can be found in 28 USC &#x00A7; 455. The statute lists the following grounds for disqualification, all of which have some application to Board proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Party or Witness</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where the AJ has had previous involvement as a party or witness in the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Relationship</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where he/she is related through blood or marriage to any of the parties, any of the witnesses, any of the representatives, or anyone who would be materially affected by the result of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where the AJ has been in practice with one of the lawyers while that lawyer was a witness in the case or worked on the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Former Representative</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where the AJ has previously served as a representative to any of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Personal Interest</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where he/she has served as a government employee and, in that capacity, was involved in any way in the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Indebtedness</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where he/she has a financial interest of any sort in the outcome of the case (this will rarely apply to Board cases).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Bias</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where he/she has a personal bias or prejudice towards a party, or has personal knowledge concerning disputed facts concerning the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(7)&#x2003;Physical Impairment</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Where the AJ suffers from some physical impairment that might disqualify him/her from ruling on the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Board has not ruled specifically on this question, but grounds for such disqualification might include a hearing impairment, a vision impairment, or an impaired ability to concentrate due to medication or physical problems. Obviously, the individual AJ is in the best position to assess his/her own physical capabilities, and should do so candidly when a question about his/her physical condition arises. However, disqualification on this ground might, in essence, prevent the AJ from hearing or adjudicating any cases while the impairment continues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;Procedure When Grounds for Disqualification Become Known</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Duty of Administrative Judge</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Once an AJ recognizes that his/her impartiality might be called into question, he/she must act to remove him/herself from the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Board's regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.42(a), make this plain, and require the AJ to record the reasons for his/her <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Waiver of Disqualification</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Although some grounds for disqualification may exist, the parties may nonetheless agree to waive the disqualification, although Congress has precluded federal judges from accepting any waivers if the disqualification is based on any of the circumstances delineated above. Thus, a judge can accept a waiver if there is only a question about his impartiality. The judge may not accept a waiver for those situations that Congress has determined are disqualifying <span class="Italic">per se</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">AJs may take the same approach in order to avoid any possible second guessing as to motives for issuing any particular decision or making any particular ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;Qualification Challenge by Party</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Any party is free to challenge the qualifications of the AJ. The Board's regulations require challenges to be made as soon as the challenging party becomes aware of a ground for disqualification. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.42(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The challenge may be made either in writing (before the hearing) or orally (at the hearing). The moving party must state with specificity the exact grounds he/she is relying on to challenge the AJ's impartiality, and is required to submit an affidavit setting forth the reason for the challenge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4)&#x2003;Administrative Judge's Answer to the Qualification Challenge</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The challenged AJ must respond to the motion. If made before the hearing, the response must be in writing. If there are no grounds (such as those enumerated above) for the motion, an order denying the motion with a reference to either <span class="Italic">Garibay v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 327 (1987) or <span class="Italic">D'Iorio v. DHUD</span>, 34 MSPR 351 (1987), noting that a series of adverse rulings is not proof of or grounds for the disqualification of an AJ, should be issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If there are any of the enumerated grounds present (financial relations, relative involvement, personal involvement, etc.), the motion should be granted with the inclusion of some remarks that indicate that while the individual AJ is confident of his/her ability to decide the case impartially, to assure that all parties are confident that they are receiving a full, fair and impartial review, the AJ will remove him/herself from the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;Review of a Denial Motion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Board's regulations provide that if a Motion to Disqualify is denied, a request for certification of the issue to the Board via an interlocutory appeal is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Further, a party's failure to request such certification constitutes a waiver of the issue. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.42(c). The Board has reiterated that requirement in several cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gipson v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 168, 170 (1981); <span class="Italic">Klant v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 374 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The requirements for an interlocutory appeal are set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(6)&#x2003;Effect of a Disqualification</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">An AJ who disqualifies him/herself <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, or upon the motion of one of the parties, should return the case promptly to the Chief Administrative Judge, who will then reassign the case to another AJ, or, if necessary, arrange for the case to be heard by an AJ from another region or by the Board's Administrative Law Judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The Chief Administrative Judge's choice from among these options will, of necessity, depend on the reasons for the disqualification and the status of the pending case. It is very important for AJs to recognize cases in which their impartiality might be questioned at an early stage, and to promptly notify their Regional Directors of any potential problems.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57, 70 (1984), summed up the law on bias allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prevail on a claim of bias or prejudice, respondent must overcome a presumption of the honesty and integrity of the presiding administrative law judge. <span class="Italic">Ash Grove Cement Company v. FTC,</span> 577 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir., 1978) <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 439 U.S. 982, 99 S. Ct. 571, 58 L. Ed.2d 653 (1978) and <span class="Italic">Withrow v. Larkin,</span> 421 U.S. 35, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed.2d 712 (1975). That presumption may be overcome only upon a substantial showing of personal bias. <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Morton</span>, 549 F.2d 158 (10th Cir. 1976), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 434 U.S. 834, 98 S. Ct. 121, 54 L. Ed.2d 95 (1977). <span class="Italic">See also Converse v.

The mere fact that a hearing officer has ruled against a party does not support a claim of personal bias<span class="Italic">. NLRB v. Donnelly Garment Company</span>, 330 U.S. 219, 236-237, 67 S. Ct. 756, 765, 91 L. Ed. 854 (1947). <span class="Italic">See Marcus v. Director, Office</span> <span class="Italic">of Workers Compensation Programs,</span> 548 F. 2d 1044, 1051 (D.C. Cir. 1976). <span class="Italic">See also Oliver v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, 1 MSPB 368, 370, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980) and <span class="Italic">In re Chocallo</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent has not only failed to make any substantial showing of bias, he has failed to show any degree of bias or prejudice. Our review of the record shows a presiding administrative law judge who was courteous and reasonable throughout the hearing, applied the Board's discovery <span id="Page_1433"></span>rules correctly, controlled respondent's cross-examination to prevent diversion from the issues in the complaint, and gave respondent the opportunity to present direct evidence. Respondent affirmatively rejected the opportunity to testify or to present his own witnesses or documents, a course that Judge Reidy could properly consider when evaluating the evidence of record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite respondent's refusal to present a direct defense and refusal to participate in the discussion concerning post-hearing briefs (although he was present), Judge Reidy stated on the record that he would consider any post-hearing brief respondent might file. Judge Reidy granted respondent's later request for an extension of time to file a post-hearing brief. In his recommended decision, Judge Reidy considered the briefs of both parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather than bias, the record shows a presiding administrative law judge who demonstrated firm control while acting with impartiality and forbearance in a difficult proceeding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ahuruonye v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 690 Fed. Appx. 670, 679-80 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), said of bias allegations against an AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board applies a presumption of honesty and integrity to administrative judges, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Stussy v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, No. SF-1221-14-0068-W-1, 2015 WL 3874704, at &#x00B6; 17 (M.S.P.B. June 23, 2015); <span class="Italic">Sullivan v.

Mgmt</span>., 350 Fed. Appx. 448, 451 (Fed. Cir. 2009). To establish bias, an appellant must show more than mere disagreement with the judge's substantive rulings. <span class="Italic">See Chianelli v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 8 Fed. Appx. 971, 979-81 (Fed. Cir. 2001). And even the existence of multiple rulings adverse to the party, or multiple rulings containing errors, does not itself rise to the level needed for recusal, especially where the appellant has presented a blizzard of filings, many hard to parse, that demand large numbers of rulings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 279-80 (1988) ("[T]he Supreme Court has recognized that administrative adjudicators are deemed to be persons of 'conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances,' <span class="Italic">United States v. Morgan,</span> 313 U.S. 409, 421, 61 S. Ct. 999, 1004, 85 L. Ed. 1429 (1941).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not favor permitting appellants to create situations leading to disqualification of AJs, a situation the Board considered as it reviewed the law governing disqualification of AJs, <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 68, 73-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455(a), "[a]ny justice, judge, or magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." Although the Board is not bound by section 455(a), inasmuch as the Board is not a court, the Board has held that it "see[s] no reason not to look to the rule and case law arising from 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455, where relevant...." <span class="Italic">Washington v. Department of the Interior</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 101 &#x00B6; 8 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42(b) (a party may file a motion asking the AJ to withdraw on the basis of personal bias "or other disqualification"). The goal of section 455(a) is to avoid even the appearance of partiality. <span class="Italic">Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp.</span>, 486 U.S. 847, 860 (1988). Thus, the test applied under section 455(a) is not whether a judge is in fact biased or prejudiced, but whether a judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 858-62. "In enacting section 455(a), Congress created an objective standard under which disqualification of a judge is required when a reasonable person, knowing <span class="Italic">all</span> the facts, would question the judge's impartiality." <span class="Italic">Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Bausch &#x0026; Lomb Inc.</span>, 882 F.2d 1556, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original). In applying this standard, it is critically important to identify the facts that might reasonably cause an objective observer to question the judge's impartiality. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a declaration submitted below, the appellant asserted that he had self-published the book in question, "The Taking of the Tongass: Alaska's Rainforest," and as of September 19, 2002, one thousand copies were in print. The appellant averred that: (1) A draft of the book circulated on the internet before it was published; (2) he received comments on the book from many quarters and was aware that its circulation on the internet was widespread; (3) the book is available for sale in bookstores in Alaska, Seattle, and the Olympic Peninsula; (4) the book is available for purchase through Amazon.com; (5) the book is "going to be used" as a text for a college course taught at a university in Ketchikan, Alaska; (6) he recently filled an order from the university for multiple copies to be sold to the students in the class; and (7) the book received favorable reviews in numerous publications, including the September/October 2000 issue of "Sierra" magazine, which has a nationwide circulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant submitted a copy of the book with his "Petitioner's Motion for Recusal" filed below. In the book, the appellant commented unfavorably on the AJ's physical appearance, asserted that the AJ regularly favors agencies in his decisions, and described the AJ as "inept." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 231, 240, 242.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the appellant asserts on review that the book is highly critical of the AJ, it is irrelevant whether the AJ had read the book when he denied the recusal motion, and the public might reasonably believe that the AJ knew of the book and its references to the hearing and the AJ.[2] The AJ denied the appellant's recusal motion, finding that "[a]ny public perception of unfairness created by the book is simply a result of the appellant's own effort to publicize his interpretation of the hearing process" and that "[s]uch bootstrapping falls within the doctrine of invited error and is not a basis for granting the appellant's request."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board's regulations provide that a failure to request certification of an interlocutory appeal from an AJ's denial of a motion asking the AJ to withdraw on the basis of personal bias or other disqualification is considered a waiver of the request for withdrawal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42. The appellant, however, was unable to request such certification in this case because the AJ denied the appellant's motion on the same date the AJ issued the initial decision on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not shown that the AJ abused his discretion in denying the appellant's recusal motion. <span class="Italic">See Barthel v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 245, 249-50 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also Selkridge v. United of Omaha Life Insur. Co.</span>, 360 F.3d 155, 166-67 (3d Cir. 2004) (where a motion for disqualification was made under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455(a), the court reviewed the district court judge's denial of the motion for an abuse of discretion); <span class="Italic">Hewlett-Packard</span>, 882 F.2d at 1567 (the decision on such a motion is left, in the first instance, to the trial court's discretion). The fact that the appellant wrote a book criticizing the AJ is, alone, of little probative value with respect to whether a reasonable person, knowing all of the circumstances, would question the AJ's impartiality. <span class="Italic">See Selkridge</span>, 360 F.3d at 167-68 (the fact that the appellant's attorney wrote a letter to the editor of a newspaper criticizing the district court judge was, alone, of little probative value with respect to whether a reasonable person, knowing all of the circumstances, would question the judge's impartiality). While the book may establish the appellant's feelings toward the AJ, it has no tendency to show the AJ's feelings toward the appellant. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Were the rule otherwise, "those litigants fortunate enough to have easy access to the media could make charges against a judge's impartiality that would effectively veto the assignment of judges. Judge-shopping would then become an additional and potent tactical weapon in the skilled practitioner's arsenal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">In re Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</span>, 861 F.2d 1307, 1309 (2d Cir. 1988)). The appellant presented no facts establishing the AJ's reaction to the book. <span class="Italic">Cf. Gallagher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 441 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (1999) (remanding the appeal for a new adjudication before a different AJ based on an appearance of partiality supported by uncontroverted sworn statements indicating that the AJ made disparaging remarks during a hearing recess about the appellant, the presentation of her case, and the truthfulness of a witness). Indeed, there is no showing that the AJ was even aware of the book's existence until the appellant filed the recusal motion. <span class="Italic">See Selkridge</span>, 360 F.3d at 169 (the judge's reaction to the counsel's letter to the editor was telling).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reached a similar result in <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 101 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-20, which involved an interpretation of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 455(a). The Board affirmed the AJ's denial of a recusal motion that was based solely on the fact that counsel and his law firm had filed and were pursuing an unfair labor practices charge against the AJ in another case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that the appellant's attorney had not "asserted that any statement or action by the judge in this or other cases indicates any degree of animosity against him, his law firm, or its representation of appellants in general." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 12. In reaching its decision in <span class="Italic">Washington</span>, the Board cited with approval a Ninth Circuit case holding that, even when counsel and client both "indulged in unbridled attacks on the impartiality and integrity of the trial judge," filed a charge of conspiracy against him, and requested damages in excess of $15,000,000.00 trebled, as well as punitive damages, the same result, i.e., a finding that recusal was not required, obtained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find under the relevant facts presented in this case that the AJ did not abuse his discretion in denying the appellant's recusal motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of bias against arbitrators are rare in MSPB cases seeking review of arbitration awards. The Board applies the same standards in evaluating those allegations in challenges to arbitration awards that it applies to allegations of bias against its own AJs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v.
