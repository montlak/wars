<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-141"><span class="space">I.</span> FIREFIGHTER RETIREMENT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Firefighter retirement status was denied in <span class="Italic">Weatherby v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 466 F.3d 1379, 1380-81, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2006), explaining the retirement system:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Thor Weatherby, III appeals from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") upholding the denial of his claim for enhanced annuity benefit credits as a firefighter. <span class="Italic">Weatherby v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> No. SF-0842-05-0195-1-2 (M.S.P.B. July 29, 2005). Because the Board correctly found that neither the job descriptions of positions that petitioner held nor his actual primary duties met the statutory definition of "firefighter" under either the statute establishing the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS") or the superseding Federal Employee Retirement System ("FERS"), we affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain federal employees who work in unusually hazardous positions are entitled to enhanced retirement benefits. For example, firefighters and law enforcement officers are eligible for voluntary retirement earlier than other federal employees, i.e., at any age if they have completed 25 years of service in a qualified position or at age 50 after 20 years of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336(c), 8412(d). In addition, they are entitled to a larger annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(d), 8415(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under CSRS, a "firefighter" is statutorily defined as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires <span class="Italic">or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment,</span> including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21) (emphasis added). Under FERS, a "firefighter" is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an employee, the duties of whose position--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;are primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by the Director considering the recommendations of the employing agency; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;an employee who is transferred directly to a supervisory or administrative position after performing duties described in subparagraph (A) for at least 3 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(14) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The implementing regulations mirror these statutory definitions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902, 842.802. In addition, the regulations describe how the "primary duties" of an employee's position are determined. The following factors are to be considered: (1) whether those duties constitute the basic reasons for existence of the position; (2) whether they occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and (3) whether they are regular and recurring. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902, 842.802. Duties of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature, however, are not "primary," even if they occupy a substantial portion of the individual's time. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.902, 842.802. In deciding whether an employee is eligible for firefighter retirement credit, the Board has adopted the "position-oriented" approach emphasized in the FERS statute that focuses on the reasons for the position's existence, based on the official job description as well as the employee's actual day-to-day duties. <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Dep't of the Interior,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 174, &#x00B6; 12 (M.S.P.B.2003); <span class="Italic">see also Watson v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (approving a similar analytic approach for law enforcement officers).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits, substantial evidence supports the AJ's finding that petitioner's primary duties before December 31, 1986 did not involve the type of firefighting work contemplated by the CSRS definition. In extending special retirement benefits to firefighters, Congress intended "that employees must be exposed to some hazard to qualify even under the maintenance and use clause." <span class="Italic">Felsien</span>, 930 F.2d at 902<span class="Italic">; see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 92-840 (1972), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2941, 2944. Until June 1986, however, petitioner's maintenance and repair of electronic communications equipment was confined to the safety of the radio shop. With respect to the four fires in June 1986, the AJ recognized that petitioner's duties performed while assigned to the command center were similar to Felzien's work as a communications officer. Yet, unlike Felzien, who had done such work regularly, petitioner's exposure to hazardous fire conditions was limited to this one occasion. This was insufficient to demonstrate that the primary duties of his Electronic Mechanic position deviated from his official job description and concerned front-line firefighting activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner concedes that the definition of "firefighter" under FERS is more restrictive. Not only was the "sufficiently rigorous" clause added by the FERS Act, but the "maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment" clause was deleted. Moreover, the Senate Report expressly states that the FERS definition only applies where the employee "will actually and directly participate in firefighting activities." S. Rep. No. 99-166, at 40 (1985), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1404, 1445. We have previously found that "work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires" means "the type of front-line firefighting duties so obviously hazardous and physically demanding that they supply the ordinary meaning of `firefighting.'" <span class="Italic">Felsien</span>, 930 F.2d at 902. The maintenance of firefighting equipment is perhaps <span class="Italic">indirectly</span> connected with such front-line firefighting duties but does not satisfy 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="Page_4321"></span>8401(14)(A)(i). Because both subsections (i) and (ii) must be satisfied to earn firefighter credit, it is insufficient that some of petitioner's other job duties were physically rigorous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the AJ correctly held that none of petitioner's service as an Electronic Mechanic after January 1, 1987 qualified for firefighting credit under the FERS definition. This holding was heavily dependent on subsidiary findings of fact that were supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, none of his subsequent administrative positions could qualify for secondary firefighter credit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The early retirement system for firefighters was also described in <span class="Italic">Nuss v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 451, 454-57 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the merits of the appellant's application. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336(c)(1) and 8339(d)(1), a Federal employee with at least 20 years of service as a "firefighter" can retire at age 50 with an enhanced annuity. <span class="Italic">See Hall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 621, 623-24 (1992). The term "firefighter" is defined as "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21); <span class="Italic">Hall</span> at 624.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant satisfied the statutory requirements for enhanced retirement benefits as a firefighter based upon his service in various Park Ranger positions that he held at Yellowstone National Park from 1953 through 1980. The administrative judge based this conclusion upon record evidence establishing the following: (1) Throughout his career, the appellant was recognized by Park Service superiors as having extensive firefighting experience based upon his attendance and participation in special training courses, his actual participation in fighting major, structural, and minor fires both within and outside Yellowstone, which gained him the rank of Fireboss 2 and Lineboss 1, and his implementation of special firefighting innovations and policies; (2) firefighting was the primary duty of his multiple-duty job because Park Rangers were allowed to seek and pursue a specialty among the several duties they performed, and because the appellant was originally selected as a Yellowstone Park Ranger, and later promoted to supervisory Park Ranger positions, because of his firefighting experience; and (3) firefighting took a significant portion of his time as compared to other duties, and was otherwise time consuming.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching the conclusion that this evidence satisfied the appellant's burden of proof, the administrative judge rejected OPM's assertion that the appellant was not entitled to the enhanced benefits because the record established that the appellant did not spend more than 50% of his time on firefighting duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM does not challenge the administrative judge's factual findings. Instead, it argues that the appellant's assertion, that firefighting was his primary duty, is contrary to Congress's intent when it enacted Pub. Law 94-458, titled "National Park System--Improvement in Administration." OPM also argues that the appellant is not entitled to enhanced benefits because the administrative judge found that the appellant did not spend more than 50% of his time on firefighting duties, and that it has historically awarded such benefits only to applicants who do satisfy this 50% test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the 50% requirement, OPM asserts that it has historically awarded enhanced benefits where applicants have shown that they had performed more than 50% of their duties as a firefighter, and that the Board should defer to its interpretation on this matter. OPM concedes, however, that this requirement was not contained in its regulations at the time it issued its reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (1989). Further, OPM's historic use of this requirement does not, by itself, require the Board to defer to its interpretation. For example, the court in <span class="Italic">Felzien</span> held that OPM's long-standing interpretation of the statutory definition of firefighter, as set forth in the version of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 at that time, was not entitled to deference because it was contrary to Congressional intent and the statute's plain meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> 898 F.2d at 902-03.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note, however, that the current version of OPM's regulations pertaining to this matter does refer to the 50% requirement. It states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Primary Duties</span> means those duties of a position that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;Occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(c)&#x2003;Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Duties that are of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature cannot be considered "primary" even if they meet the substantial portion of time criterion. In general, if an employee spends as [sic] average of at least 50 percent of his or her time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his or her primary duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide, however, whether the 50% rule, added in 1992, applies retroactively. We can decide this case under subsections (a), (b), and (c) which have simply been carried over from the previous versions of the regulations which were in effect when OPM issued its reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has satisfied this requirement. The administrative judge's findings that the appellant reached high prominence among his peers in firefighting, that he was originally selected as a Park Ranger because of his firefighting experience, and that he was later promoted to supervisory positions because of his firefighting expertise, satisfy section (a). While firefighting may not generally be the basic reason for the existence of Park Ranger positions, the record in this case establishes that it was the basic reason the appellant's employing agency selected him for the positions for which he is seeking enhanced benefits. Because the appellant's firefighting talent was deemed especially desirable by his employing agency, we find it appropriate to infer that his employing agency considered firefighting to be the basic reason for the particular jobs the appellant held.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the administrative judge's findings that firefighting duties took a significant portion of the appellant's time and were generally time consuming, and that the appellant developed vast experience fighting different kinds of fires, implementing innovations and policies, and consulting with other Park officials on firefighting matters, satisfy sections (b) and Cc). We, therefore, conclude that the appellant has established that the duties of his positions in question were primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(21). Accordingly, he is entitled to the enhanced benefits he seeks.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Similarly, Felzien v. OPM</span>, 930 F.2d 898, 899-904 (Fed. Cir. 1991), explored the nature of firefighter early retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From May 23, 1965 through July 2, 1977, Felzien worked as a Forest Electronics Technician for the United States Forest Service, Department of Agriculture. During his three and one-half years at the Clearwater National Forest in Idaho, his two and one-third years at the Sitgraves National Forest in Arizona, and his six and one-half years at the Gila National Forest in New Mexico, Felzien worked on hundreds of fires. Though his responsibilities grew as he moved from Clearwater to Sitgraves to Gila, at each location Felzien functioned primarily as a communications officer. Upon arriving at fire sites, he would design, install, and maintain communications systems that were both essential to extinguishing the fires and instrumental in assuring the safety of other firefighters. Indeed, while not directly attacking the fire, a communications officer like Felzien could make a greater contribution to fire suppression than a front-line firefighter brandishing pick and shovel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Communications systems included telephones, "handi-talkies," "repeaters" (electronic devices that transmit communications over rough terrain and long distances), and radios. The Forest Service acquired most of this equipment specifically for fighting fires; firefighting was the highest priority use of the equipment and most of it was stored in permanent fire caches. Felzien used the equipment throughout the year. In fall and winter, he maintained, repaired, and tested it; in spring, he trained other personnel to use it; and in summer, the fire season, he deployed it and maintained it in actual fire suppression efforts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Felzien's summer duties were both hazardous and physically demanding. The communications systems had to be set up at fire locations, and this often entailed flying over the fires to specially design systems and decide where to place individual devices. Installing the devices was frequently the most dangerous aspect of the job, because they often had to be placed in precarious places accessible only by climbing towers or trees or negotiating mountainous terrain. On one occasion, for example, Felzien had to hang from a hovering helicopter to put a device on a mountain peak.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Felzien installed a communications system, he typically worked out of a "spike camp," a staging camp between the fire line and the base camp. There he repaired and altered the system or its components as necessary. He also carried a pulaski, shovel, and bucket in his truck, front-line firefighting implements which the Forest Service required anyone on or near the fire line to carry because of their continual exposure to danger. To minimize that danger and to maintain the physical abilities his job required, each spring Felzien, like other firefighters, was required to pass a physical fitness test. He also carried a "red card" that certified his skill and ability to perform firefighting duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Believing he was entitled to early retirement with an enhanced annuity because of his service as a firefighter, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(21), 8336(c)(1), 8339(d)(1) (1988); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (1990), on June 30, 1988 Felzien asked the Forest Service for its opinion and recommendation. Notwithstanding <span id="Page_4322"></span>his actual duties and the fact that the Forest Service had paid him largely from "fire dedicated" funding, the agency concluded that none of Felzien's service was creditable as "firefighting." It noted that none of his position descriptions "says or implies that [his] primary duty was firefighting," and "there is no evidence that he personally extinguished fires." It concluded that Felzien was no more a firefighter than other Forest Service employees--electronic technicians, aircraft mechanics, retardant mixers, and warehousemen--whose positions likewise "d[id] not expose them to the `vigorous demands' of firefighting."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Felzien persisted and submitted his claim to OPM. It, too, denied the claim because there was no evidence that he personally extinguished fires or that he used the communications equipment other than to install and test it. OPM stressed that "coverage as a firefighter is restricted to those who actually engage in firefighting duties" and likened Felzien's service to that of a fire inspector, who maintains but does not also use fire extinguishers and sprinkler systems and therefore does not qualify as a firefighter. When, on reconsideration, OPM reiterated its rationale and reaffirmed its decision, Felzien appealed to the board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board noted at the outset that the statutory definition of "firefighter" in section 8331(21) must be strictly construed because it governs entitlement to special benefits. The statute deems a "firefighter" an employee whose duties are "primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires <span class="Italic">or</span> the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21) (emphasis added). The board conceded that the use of "the disjunctive does suggest that the term is not necessarily limited to its 'ordinary meaning'" of a person who combats fires. Slip op. at 8. However, because of the great deference owed OPM policies implementing the civil service retirement system, <span class="Italic">see McDannel v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9265097743845710749&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">716 F.2d 1063</a>, 1066 (5th Cir. 1983), especially those of long standing, <span class="Italic">see Seltzer v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2007142640426788055&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">833 F.2d 975</a>, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the board acquiesced in OPM's argument that the use of the disjunctive "was not particularly significant." Slip op. at 8. OPM asserted that since 1972, when Congress extended the preferential retirement treatment originally accorded FBI agents and law enforcement officers to firefighters, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub.L. No. 92-382, 86 Stat. 539 (1972), it has considered only those who physically combat fires--and who may incidentally or in the off seasons maintain and repair firefighting apparatus and equipment--to be "firefighters" within the meaning of the statute. Thus, for example, OPM does not credit the position of Mechanic (Crash Truck) because persons filling it do not engage in firefighting duties, are not exposed to hazard, and merely care for and maintain but do not use firefighting apparatus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the event this statutory construction were incorrect, the board alternatively found that Felzien "set up and maintained communications systems and devices, but he did not himself actually use them in any of the various ways they were used to actually fight fires." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8. Since the statute clearly requires maintenance <span class="Italic">and</span> use, the board concluded Felzien did not qualify. Finally, even if Felzien maintained and used the communications equipment, he did not qualify as a firefighter because that equipment is not the "firefighting apparatus or equipment" contemplated by the statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9. In the board's view, only equipment that is unique to firefighting counts under the statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because "[t]he occupation of firefighting is among the most hazardous in the world," H.R. Rep. No. 840, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 2941, 2942 [House Report], Congress in 1972 extended the preferential retirement treatment previously accorded FBI agents and federal law enforcement officers to federal employees whose duties "are primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment." <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub.L. No. 92-382, 86 Stat. 539 (1972). The House Report explains that the law</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">extend[s] the hazardous occupation provisions to those Federal firemen who primarily perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires, or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment....&#8197;[a]n individual determination of early retirement eligibility based upon the danger of the employee's duties will be made by responsible officials who have access to duty and personnel records. <span class="Italic">No firemen who had not in fact been exposed to hazards over a 20-year period would be eligible for such preferential consideration.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">House Report at 2944 (emphasis added). Congress intended not only to reward employees who performed especially hazardous duties in the public interest, <span class="Italic">see Ellis v. United States</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5373713597381535979&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">610 F.2d 760</a>, 764, 222 Ct. Cl. 65 (1979), but to "facilitate the maintenance of relatively younger and more vigorous firefighting forces throughout the Federal establishment." House Report at 2944.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law allows any employee with at least 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer, a firefighter, or a combination of the two to retire at age 50 with an enhanced annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8336(c)(1), 8339(d)(1). A "firefighter" is defined as</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily to perform work directly connected with [1] the control and extinguishment of fires <span class="Italic">or</span> [2] the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21) (emphasis added) (codifying Pub.L. 93-350, &#x00A7; 2(b), 88 Stat. 355, 356 (1974)). When Congress adopted this definition in 1974, it again noted the hazardous nature of firefighting but stressed instead the physical demands of the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The history of retirement legislation dealing with law-enforcement officers and firefighters shows Congressional intent to liberalize retirement provisions so as to make it feasible for these employees to retire at age 50. This intent has been based on the nature of the work involved and the determination that these occupations should be composed, insofar as possible, of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the Federal Service. They are occupations calling for the strength and stamina of the young rather than the middle aged. Older employees in these occupations should be encouraged to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 948, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 3698, 3699 [Senate Report] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "firefighter" definition thus embodies Congress' concern about the hazards of the job on the one hand and its physical requirements on the other. In addition to covering employees engaged in "control and extinguishment," the type of front-line firefighting duties so obviously hazardous and physically demanding that they supply the ordinary meaning of "firefighting," <span class="Italic">see Ellis</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5373713597381535979&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">610 F.2d at 764</a>, the definition includes employees who maintain and use firefighting apparatus and equipment. Their jobs may be less hazardous, or less obviously so, than those of their front-line peers, but Congress thought their activities sufficiently dangerous and strenuous to merit the same preferential retirement treatment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is obvious that OPM thinks otherwise. Though its regulation implementing section 8331(21) is identical to the statute in all relevant respects, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902, in practice it substitutes an "and" for the "or" between the "control and extinguishment" and "maintenance and use" clauses. Before the board,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he OPM representative argued...that the use of the disjunctive was not particularly significant, and that the language "<span class="Italic">or</span> the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment" merely recognizes the obvious fact that a firefighter can only fight fires when there are fires to fight. In between fires, a firefighter spends a great deal of time doing other things, primarily the maintenance and use of firefighting equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Since Felzien did not claim to have personally and directly controlled and extinguished fires--he "candidly testified that he rarely, if ever, actually used the systems to perform actual fire suppression functions," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at n.13--it was of no consequence to OPM whether he maintained and used the communications equipment or whether the equipment qualified as "firefighting apparatus and equipment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board adopted OPM's erroneous construction. With a nod to a few traditional administrative law principles--that an agency's interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering is entitled to great deference, and that congressional inaction in view of a long-standing agency interpretation of which Congress is aware indicates congressional satisfaction with that interpretation--the board concluded that OPM's interpretation "is not an unreasonable construction of the language." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think it is. It is contrary to Congress' intent both as apparent from the statute's plain meaning and as explained in the legislative history. Notwithstanding OPM's assertion to the contrary, "or" <span class="Italic">means</span> "or": an employee can qualify either by controlling and extinguishing fires <span class="Italic">or</span> by maintaining and using firefighting apparatus and equipment. The House Report does imply that employees must be exposed to some hazard to qualify even under the maintenance and use clause, but that does not collapse the two clauses into one. The Senate Report emphasizes the physical demands of most firefighting jobs, not the hazards they entail; accordingly, any reading of the statute that disqualifies an employee solely because he did not assume <span class="Italic">enough</span> risk--that is, because he was not a front-line firefighter who personally controlled and extinguished fires--disregards one of the statute's primary purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative law principles on which the board relied in upholding OPM's interpretation and which OPM, in turn, cites in support of the board's decision are simply inapplicable. Felzien does not challenge OPM's regulation and, in any event, the regulation does not interpret the statute. It is instead an almost verbatim reproduction of the definition set by Congress. Therefore <span class="Italic">McDannel, McLean v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=368248130882792880&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">800 F.2d 254, 255</a> (Fed.

Cir. 1986), are <span id="Page_4323"></span>not germane. Each case addressed a challenge to an OPM regulation, and each regulation interpreted a statute by either supplying an omission or resolving an ambiguity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A nonexistent interpretation obviously cannot be one of long standing, so <span class="Italic">Seltzer</span> and <span class="Italic">Money v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10839785657536319798&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">811 F.2d 1474</a>, 1477 (Fed. Cir. 1987), are similarly inapplicable. We are aware of no OPM rule or regulation, of long standing or otherwise, which specifies that communications officers like Felzien are not "firefighters." That OPM previously has denied firefighter credit to employees filling the positions of electronic technicians, aircraft mechanics, retardant mixers, warehousemen, dispatchers, crash truck mechanics, and fire inspectors does not amount to a statutory interpretation that persons like Felzien also cannot qualify. Indeed, given our prior admonitions that the duties actually performed by the employee and not only the official position description determine benefit eligibility, <span class="Italic">see Cole v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16734398243583490102&q=930+F.2d+898&hl=en&as_sdt=2,47">754 F.2d 984</a>, 986 (Fed.

Cir. 1985), we doubt that OPM could disqualify by rule or regulation all employees who hold a specific position. Stripped of its armor of undue deference, OPM merely invites us to defer to its decision in this particular case. We decline the invitation. The law prevents us from abdicating review, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c), and we would not in any event embrace a principle that rendered our role superfluous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Felzien's duties of maintaining and using communications systems and equipment qualify him as a firefighter. There is no doubt that the communications equipment Felzien used is the type of "firefighting apparatus and equipment" contemplated by section 8331(21). The use to which the equipment is actually put, not the uses to which it could be put, is dispositive. The Forest Service acquired the equipment specifically for firefighting, stored most of it in fire caches, designated firefighting as its highest priority use, and actually used it to fight fires. That the equipment has other uses and therefore is not unique to firefighting, <span class="Italic">see</span> slip op. at 9, is irrelevant. Were that the test, pulaskis, shovels, hoses, and buckets also would not qualify as firefighting equipment because all have uses unrelated to fighting fires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also are satisfied that Felzien "used" firefighting equipment in the sense intended by the maintenance and use clause. He need not "actually use [the equipment] in any of the various ways [it is] used to actually fight fires." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8. Requiring him to do so effectively reads into the maintenance and use clause the limitations of the control and extinguishment clause. The clauses are independent; OPM cannot achieve indirectly, by narrowly construing "use," what the plain language of the statute does not allow--substituting an "and" for the "or" Congress deliberately used to link the two clauses. Felzien used the equipment for many purposes, if not directly to fight fires: he personally installed, tested, and maintained it and also trained others to use it. That is sufficient to constitute "use" within the meaning of section 8331(21).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally and most importantly, Felzien was exposed to precisely the types of hazards and physical demands Congress envisioned when it extended preferential retirement treatment to firefighters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">His work was hazardous, in the sense that anyone on or near the fire line was exposed to danger, and because he often had to fly over the fire to design a system and position the individual devices. In addition, he climbed towers and poles with spurs and sometimes had to place devices in precarious places on mountainous terrain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The work was also physically demanding. Because he was required to go "on site" wherever the fire was, he often had to traverse rough terrain or climb steep mountains.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.904(a), a firefighter "includes an employee whose <span class="Italic">primary</span> duties, as set forth in the official position description, require the performance of work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment." [Emphasis added] Section 831.904(b) provides that administrative service where firefighting experience is a basic qualification for the administrative position may be included in the definition of firefighter if the employee is transferred to the position following service in a firefighter position without a break in service of more than 3 days or intervening employment that was not as a firefighter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of the Forester (Administration) position, Position No. 1-4467, GS-460-11, reveals that the incumbent serves as District Manager and is responsible for the administration, protection, development and utilization of all resources and improvements of the Salway Ranger District of the Nezperce National Forest. Although the incumbent is required "to provide an adequate fire protection and control program," fire control is but one of a number of functions incidental to the responsibility of the district manager, including timber management, wildlife management, watershed management, recreation, grazing, land uses, improvement and general administration. We find that the record does not support the presiding official's conclusion that the deceased's duties in this position constituted Firefighter duties as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The co-worker's affidavit indicates that the deceased had spent about 50% of his time on fire control work, including suppression, pre-suppression, fire-planning, and training, and that he spent much of his official time on work associated with fire because of his "intense interest in fire," even though the fire season in the district was only 5 months long. This affidavit, although not furnished to OPM, when coupled with the deceased's own record of the fires in which he was involved during this period, does not alter the fact that the duties were not primarily firefighter as defined by the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the presiding official erred in finding that the position of Forester (Administration), GS-460-11, constituted primary firefighter service, that the deceased was entitled to credit for his subsequent service in firefighter administrative positions and that the appellant was entitled to an annuity based upon the firefighter provision.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">For the purpose of the service credit, a firefighter is defined as an employee whose position duties are "primarily to perform work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. OPM created the following three-prong test to assist in determining which duties are considered the "primary duties" of a particular position: (1) whether the duties are paramount in influence or weight, that is, whether they constitute the basic reasons for existence of the position; (2) whether the duties occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle; and (3) whether the duties are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.3 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. All three criteria must be met to demonstrate service credit eligibility. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1299.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee spends an average of at least 50 percent of his time performing a duty or group of duties, those are generally considered his primary duties. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. Duties of an emergency, incidental or temporary nature, however, are not "primary," even if they meet the substantial portion of the time element of OPM's test. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An employee is not entitled to firefighter service credit merely because he performed <span id="Page_4324"></span>some fire control duties, among his other position duties. <span class="Italic">Spelman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 69, 71 (1982). Rather, the primary duties of his position must be directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires. <span class="Italic">Corpe v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 430, 431 (1980) (an employee was not entitled to firefighter credit where he had consultative responsibilities regarding "slash and burn" agriculture, and was required to have an intimate knowledge of fire behavior, where the primary duties of his position were not directly connected with controlling and extinguishing fires). Furthermore, "[a]n employee whose primary duties are the performance of routine fire prevention inspection" is not considered a firefighter for service credit purposes. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has developed a "position-oriented" approach for determining LEO credit eligibility that focuses upon the reason for the existence of the position in question, which is the first prong of OPM's test. The Federal Circuit expressed approval for this approach, finding that it was consistent with the applicable statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1296. Under the position-oriented approach, the Board considers the reason for the position's existence by assessing both the official position documentation and the employee's actual day to day duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1300. Because the legislative intent behind the retirement preference and OPM's test articulated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 are the same for those requesting LEO or firefighter retirement credit, the position-oriented approach is equally applicable to employees seeking firefighter retirement credit. In fact, the Federal Circuit used this approach in deciding firefighter retirement credit cases prior to its decision in <span class="Italic">Watson. See, e.g., Perske v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 25 F.3d 1014, 1018 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("We have held that entitlement to credit for service as a firefighter must be determined on the basis of actual duties performed, as well as by the grade level or by the official description.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> the Federal Circuit articulated certain "most probative factors" for determining whether a federal officer is eligible for LEO retirement credit. Several of those factors are instructive in the firefighter context as well, such as whether (1) there is an early mandatory retirement age, (2) there is a youthful maximum entry age for the position, (3) the job is physically demanding so as to require a youthful workforce, and (4) the employee is exposed to hazard or danger. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence that any of the positions for which the appellant seeks firefighter service credit had an early mandatory retirement age or youthful maximum entry age. The appellant testified that he was required to pass a step test in order to perform firefighting duties, but nothing in the record reflects that the positions in question were so physically demanding that a youthful workforce was required. Finally, while it is clear that the appellant was exposed to hazard or danger when fighting fires, on balance this does not outweigh the absence of the other most probative factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the appellant's failure to satisfy the majority of the most probative factors pursuant to <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> the Board must also consider both the official position documentation and the appellant's actual duties for each of the positions at issue to determine the reason for the existence of those positions. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1300; <span class="Italic">Perske,</span> 25 F.3d at 1018. An examination of the relevant evidence reveals that the reasons for the existence of the appellant's positions were not firefighting. Until 1991, when full time firefighters were hired, all employees at the wildlife refuge who were physically able to do so fought wildfires when they occurred. The appellant was no exception. Further, firefighting was a priority at the refuge when a fire occurred. However, as set forth below for each relevant position, the appellant only performed firefighting duties on an emergency and incidental basis, in addition to his other position duties. This is insufficient to qualify for firefighter service credit. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902; <span class="Italic">Spelman,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. at 71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Livestock Handler (Horseman)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a Livestock Handler (Horseman) from 1979 to 1988. When the appellant began working in this position, the position description listed his major duties and responsibilities as managing wildlife resources in ways such as taking censuses of the wildlife populations, rounding up, herding, corralling, branding, dehorning, castrating, roping and vaccinating animals, as well as caring for and feeding the horses at the refuge. The position description also listed certain maintenance duties, such as dam inspection, maintenance of lake level records, fence and gate maintenance, firefighting, maintenance of salt boxes, and prescribed burning.4<span class="Italic">Id.</span> With respect to firefighting, the position description stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As knowledge of the geographic features of the refuge increase, the incumbent serves as an important member of the fire-fighting team. Will be detailed to scout fires in remote areas, thereby directing suppression forces into area for most efficient use of time, manpower, and equipment. As a member of the fire-fighting team uses hand tools and motorized pumps to contain a wildfire. Must understand fire conditions and behavior. Must be adept at recognizing conditions for and setting back-fires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later editions of the position description added the duties of record keeping for the longhorn population, carpentry, painting, motor vehicle maintenance and janitorial duties, and removed the detailed language regarding firefighting set forth above. Instead, the later position descriptions stated that the "incumbent may be called upon to perform tasks involving fire suppression, wildlife inventories, search and rescue, and other miscellaneous duties not requiring any major skill, training or experience." Thus, according to the position descriptions, the reason for the existence of the Livestock Handler position was to manage the wildlife resources and livestock at the refuge. Firefighting was a duty performed only on an incidental or emergency basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The preponderance of the evidence concerning the appellant's actual duties as a Livestock Handler does not vary from the duties listed in the position descriptions. The appellant testified that as a Livestock Handler he participated in livestock roundups, castrated animals, sold calves, took care of horses, worked on fences, and participated in prescribed burns and fighting wildfires. Performance evaluations reveal that firefighting was a non-critical element of the position, along with maintenance section duties and vehicle operation. On the other hand, the critical elements of the appellant's position were longhorn management, buffalo management, horse management, other biological section programs, record keeping, and facilities and equipment maintenance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not disputed that the appellant performed certain firefighting duties while in the Livestock Handler position. However, the record reflects that these duties were infrequent. While the evidence is somewhat inconsistent, it indicates that at most, the appellant assisted in fighting one wildfire in 1979, thirteen in 1980, two in 1981, six in 1983, nine in 1984, five in 1985, ten in 1986, three small fires in 1987, and eighteen wildfires in 1988. The vast majority of these fires lasted 1 or 2 days each.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also participated in five prescribed burns in 1980, one in 1981, two in 1983, one in 1984, one in 1986, one in 1987, and five in 1988. The appellant testified that during the earlier years of his employment at the refuge, prescribed burns were performed in 1 day, but that in later years they usually lasted approximately 2 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant served as the fire marshal for the refuge from 1984 through 1988, and fire marshal duties were a critical job element of his Livestock Handler position from at least October 1987, to September 1988. Because the statutory definition of a firefighter includes those who maintain and use firefighting apparatus and equipment, the time the appellant spent performing fire marshal duties may be properly considered by the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21); <span class="Italic">Felzien,</span> 930 F.2d at 902. Both the appellant and another employee who had acted as a fire marshal testified that each Friday the fire marshal inspected and performed maintenance on seven vehicles and other equipment used for firefighting. These duties usually required between one-half and one full day of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority of the appellant's actual duties as a Livestock Handler were not related to firefighting. Other than his fire marshal duties, which did not occupy a great deal of time, the appellant only performed duties related to firefighting on the infrequent occasions when a wildfire or prescribed burn actually occurred. The remainder of the appellant's time was occupied by the critical duties of his position--those related to maintenance of the livestock and wildlife at the refuge. Moreover, the record reveals that until full time firefighters were hired in 1991, when a fire occurred at the refuge, all of the employees who were physically qualified assisted in fighting the fire, regardless of their actual positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position descriptions and evidence of the actual duties performed by the appellant as a Livestock Handler indicate that the reason for the existence of the position was the maintenance of wildlife resources and livestock at the refuge. Accordingly, the appellant is not entitled to firefighter service credit for his employment from 1979 to 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Maintenance Worker</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain a position description for a Maintenance Worker, the position the appellant occupied from 1988 to 1992. However, a performance plan for that position indicated that the appellant performed the critical job elements of plumbing, carpentry, welding, operating and servicing vehicles, assisting with the refuge animals, and performing fire marshal duties. The appellant's non-critical duties included serving as a refuge firefighter, supervising youth program employees, and performing janitorial duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his application for the position of Maintenance Mechanic, the appellant estimated that as a Maintenance Worker, he spent approximately 20 percent of his time painting, 20 percent plumbing, 25 percent repairing facilities and structures, 15 percent performing electrical maintenance, and the remainder of his time welding, performing janitorial tasks, operating engineering equipment and motor vehicles. He listed fire suppression among other general activities, such as janitorial tasks, which consumed approximately 5 percent of his time combined. He also mentioned fire marshal duties in his application, but did not provide an estimate of the time he spent performing those duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4325"></span>At the hearing, the appellant testified that he continued to perform fire marshal duties from 1988 through 1991. These duties were a critical element of the appellant's Maintenance Worker position. However, a performance appraisal for the period from July 1989, to June 1990, indicated that the appellant only performed fire marshal duties for 1 week, and did not fight any fires during that time period. Another performance appraisal showed that from July 1990, to June 1991, the appellant fought two wildfires and participated in one prescribed burn, but did not perform any fire marshal duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other evidence reveals that at most, the appellant assisted in fighting six wildfires in 1989, eight in 1990, three in 1991, and two in 1992. Again, the majority of these fires lasted 1 or 2 days each. As for prescribed burns, the appellant participated in two in 1989, two in 1991, and three in 1992, which also lasted between 1 and 2 days each.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The preponderance of the evidence, as reflected in the performance plan and the appellant's own estimates regarding his actual duties, reveals that the reason for the existence of the Maintenance Worker position was to perform maintenance duties, rather than firefighting duties. Therefore, the appellant is not entitled to firefighter retirement credit for his employment from1988 to 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not challenged the administrative judge's findings that firefighting was not the primary reason for the existence of his Maintenance Mechanic position, or that he is not entitled to firefighter retirement credit for that position. Further, a review of the record reveals that the administrative judge correctly decided that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The preponderance of the evidence does not support a finding that firefighting was the reason for the existence of any of the appellant's positions. The appellant's failure to meet the requirements of the first prong of OPM's test under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 alone is sufficient reason to deny the appellant firefighter service credit. However, as set forth below, the appellant failed to satisfy the other two prongs of the test as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not fight fires during a substantial portion of his working time</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and a co-worker both testified that during the early years of the appellant's employment at the refuge, he spent 50 percent of his time performing firefighting duties. This calculation included performing fire marshal duties, taking classes, fighting wildfires, conducting prescribed burns, and preparation for prescribed burns, such as cutting trees or mowing. This testimony, however, was contradicted by the majority of the record evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the appellant's supervisors, who also served as the Fire Management Officer for the refuge, estimated that between January 1990, and September 1995, firefighting comprised less than 10 percent of the appellant's actual work time, and was only performed as necessary when fires occurred. This testimony comports with the preponderance of the evidence in this matter. According to a list compiled by the appellant, from 1979 to 2000, he participated in sixty-one wildfires and thirty-eight prescribed burns. Thus, on average, the appellant was involved in approximately three wildfires and two prescribed burns each year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a further illustration of the time the appellant actually spent performing firefighting-related duties, it is instructive to examine 1988, the year in which the most wildfires and prescribed burns occurred at the refuge while the appellant was employed there. The appellant spent a maximum of 36 days that year fighting wildfires. The appellant participated in five prescribed burns in 1988, and he testified that generally, prescribed burns lasted between 1 and 2 days each. Assuming the prescribed burns lasted 2 days each, the appellant spent no more than 10 days working on prescribed burns during 1988. Therefore, in the year when the most fires occurred at the refuge, the appellant spent a maximum of 46 days on duties related to actual fires.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During 1988, the appellant testified that he also performed fire marshal duties. However, those duties occupied at most, one-half to one full day each week. Even assuming that the appellant spent an entire day each week for 52 weeks in 1988 performing fire marshal duties, added to the totals for wildfires and prescribed burns, the appellant only spent 98 working days performing fire-related activities that year. This did not constitute a substantial portion of the appellant's working time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The time the appellant spent taking classes related to firefighting should not be counted when calculating firefighter retirement credit, as the time was not spent directly in controlling and extinguishing fires, or in maintaining and using firefighting apparatus and equipment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21). In any event, the appellant only took eighteen classes related to firefighting from 1980 to 1997. Some of the courses lasted 1 day, while others were 2 or 3 day courses. Even if these courses were counted, the appellant would not be entitled to firefighter service credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's firefighting duties did not occur on a regular and recurring basis.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As demonstrated by the number of fires with which the appellant was involved at the refuge, firefighting duties were not assigned to him on a regular and recurring basis. Instead, he only participated in firefighting when wildfires or prescribed burns took place. As set forth above, neither event occurred with enough frequency to deem the duties regular.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant's fire marshal duties were supposed to be performed once each week, the record reflects that, at least in certain years, those duties were performed rarely, if at all. Moreover, the maintenance duties the appellant performed as a fire marshal alone do not qualify as firefighting. The appellant's maintenance of firefighting equipment would have to have been coupled with regular and recurring use of that equipment to meet the statutory definition of firefighting. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(21). The evidence does not show that the appellant used firefighting equipment on a regular and recurring basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The preponderance of the evidence does not support a finding that the appellant is entitled to firefighter service credit for any of the positions at issue. Accordingly, the initial decision is REVERSED with respect to the finding that the appellant was entitled to firefighter service credit from 1979 to 1991, and AFFIRMED with respect to the finding that the appellant was not entitled to firefighter service credit from 1991 to 2000.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">All three appellants previously held positions in the Fire Department of the agency's Hampton Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Hampton, Virginia....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, decided to abolish its internal fire department, use the city of Hampton's fire department for firefighting services, and reassign the appellants to other positions at the same grade level. Thus, it assigned appellant Scott to the position of Program Specialist, GS-0301-10, appellant Blottner to a Program Support Assistant, GS-0303-06 position, and appellant Thomas to the position of Fire Protection Inspector, GS-0081-07. All of these positions were in the "Fire Prevention" section of the VAMC's Facilities Management Service. The agency also informed the appellants that they were no longer entitled to firefighter retirement coverage they had previously received in their former positions because the VAMC no longer had a firefighting mission, and the duties of their new positions did not meet the definition of firefighter.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations refer to the "supervisory" and "administrative" positions that are included within the definition of "firefighter" as "secondary" positions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 provides that a "secondary position" is a position that is "clearly" in the firefighting field, is in an organization having a firefighting mission, and is either "supervisory" or "administrative." It defines "supervisory" as "a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor or [sic] firefighters in rigorous positions," and defines "administrative" as "an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a rigorous firefighting position, or equivalent experience outside the Federal Government, is a mandatory prerequisite." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Scott argues that he remains entitled to firefighter retirement credit because his new position is either "supervisory" or "administrative" within the meaning of the statute and regulations. Appellants Blottner and Thomas assert that they remain entitled to firefighter retirement coverage because their new positions are "administrative" within the meaning of the statute and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present cases, there is no dispute that all of the appellants met the definition of "firefighter" before the agency assigned them to their new positions, that they performed those firefighting duties for more than three years, and that the only issue before us is whether the appellants satisfy the requirements for a covered "secondary" position. Indeed, the agency stipulated that each appellant served as a firefighter in his former position. In order to determine whether the appellants satisfy the requirements for "secondary" coverage, we must first determine the correct standard for this inquiry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Position-Oriented Approach</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge applied the "position-oriented" approach, set forth in <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 318, for determining LEO retirement credit, to decide the appellants' firefighter retirement service credit. Initial Decision at 3. FERS defines a LEO as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an employee, the duties of whose position--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;are primarily--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(I)&#x2003;the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(II)&#x2003;the protection of officials of the United States against threats to personal safety; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals, as determined by the Director [of OPM] considering the recommendations of the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> the Board examined the statutory definition under FERS, providing that a LEO is "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily...the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17)(A); <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 8. It then found that, pursuant to statutory authority to prescribe regulations administering both FERS and the CSRS, OPM defined the term "primary duties" for purposes of FERS LEO retirement credit. The definition states that "primary duties" are those duties that are paramount in influence or weight, that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position, occupy a substantial portion of the individual's working time over a typical work cycle, and are assigned on a regular and recurring basis. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802; <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 10. Based upon this statute and regulation, the Board concluded that it must examine the duties of the position to determine whether an employee meets the definition of a LEO. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's "position-oriented" approach in <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> finding it an approach that more affirmatively assesses the basic reasons for the positions' existence consistent with the statutes and regulations governing LEO eligibility. <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1296-97, 1299. It found that emphasizing why the position exists was consistent with the legislative intent behind the LEO retirement program--limiting LEO eligibility to rigorous positions for which retirement at an unusually early age is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1299. Thus, it concluded that the Board's approach, that considered both the position documentation and the actual duties, appropriate and consistent with judicial precedent.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1300-02. In <span class="Italic">Luke v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 320 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court described its holding in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> as follows: "the determination of LEO eligibility should normally be based on the official documentation for the position, but that if the employee's actual day-to-day duties differ from those set forth in the position description, the actual duties should be considered as well."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present cases, the administrative judge noted that the Board had not specifically applied <span class="Italic">Watson</span> to firefighter retirement credit, but found that approach "equally applicable" to determining firefighter retirement credit appeals. She then found that, upon considering all of the evidence, including the OPM Handbook, the appellant's position descriptions, and testimony and evidence regarding their day-to-day duties, that the appellants are not entitled to the credit they seek.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has since determined that the <span class="Italic">Watson</span> "position-oriented" approach applies in determining firefighter retirement service credit. In<span class="Italic"> Dodd,</span> the Board examined the statutory and regulatory definition of the term "firefighter," including the term "primary duties," noting its similarity to the LEO requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12. It further found that the legislative intent behind the retirement preference and OPM's test for determining this retirement preference is the same for LEO and firefighter retirement credit, and concluded that the "position-oriented" approach was equally applicable to employees seeking firefighter retirement credit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Secondary Positions</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both <span class="Italic">Watson</span> and<span class="Italic"> Dodd,</span> however, involved determining whether the appellants proved entitlement to primary LEO and firefighter positions, and a question exists whether the position-oriented approach applies to secondary positions, as well. As discussed above, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 provides that a "secondary position" is a position that is "clearly" in the law enforcement or firefighting field, is in "an organization having a law enforcement or firefighting mission," and is either "supervisory" or "administrative." It defines "supervisory" as "a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor [of] law enforcement officers or firefighters in rigorous positions." Because this definition requires examining the position's "primary duties," we find that the "position-oriented" approach constitutes the correct standard for determining whether an incumbent is entitled to LEO or firefighter retirement credit for service rendered in a secondary supervisory position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "secondary position" also includes an "administrative" position, in addition to a "supervisory" position. Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802 defines "administrative" as "an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a rigorous law enforcement or firefighting position, or equivalent experience outside the Federal Government, is a mandatory prerequisite." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This definition does not include the term "primary duties," and instead focuses on whether experience as a rigorous LEO or firefighter is a "mandatory prerequisite" for the administrative position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM placed the term "mandatory prerequisite" into the regulatory definition of an "administrative" secondary position, when it promulgated its interim rules for FERS retirement coverage of LEOs, firefighters and Air Traffic Controllers on January 16, 1987. 52 Fed. Reg. 2068, 2070 (Jan. 16, 1987). It retained this term in issuing its final rule for FERS firefighter retirement coverage. 57 Fed. Reg. 32685, 32690 (July 23, 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM explained that prior to issuing its interim regulations, the regulations paralleled the CSRS regulations, and defined an "administrative" position as one where actual experience in the firefighting field was a "basic qualification," rather than a "mandatory prerequisite," and that some comments to the interim regulations objected to this change. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 32686. OPM stated that its "longstanding policy in administering the CSRS" provided that an "administrative secondary position must require past experience in a primary position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It explained that coverage of administrative staff under the early retirement plan was justified only if it was necessary to fill administrative positions with employees covered under the plan, who would not be willing to accept administrative positions unless they were allowed to continue in the special retirement plan. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It further stated that an administrative position that did not require primary experience was not really in the firefighter career track and that the law intended that the special early retirement benefit be reserved for individuals remaining on that career track. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It further added that it has "consistently" interpreted "basic qualification" to mean a "fundamental or essential requirement," and that it was attempting to clarify its policy by using the term "mandatory prerequisite" in the regulations, noting that it made this change to the CSRS regulations governing firefighters on December 17, 1987, and that the FERS regulations "simply establish a parallel rule" for FERS firefighters.<span class="Italic"> Id.; see</span> 52 Fed. Reg. 47893 (Dec. 17, 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further noted that on "rare occasions," a position could qualify as an administrative secondary position, even though the official position description does not identify rigorous experience as a mandatory prerequisite. This would occur where, at the time the agency fills the position, it has a valid organizational need that mandates filling the administrative position only with someone having rigorous experience. In this case, the position would be deemed to meet the mandatory prerequisite requirement during the tenure of the person hired to meet that need, but that generally, a position description should be revised to reflect that organizational need. 57 Fed. Reg. at 32686.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, unlike the "position-oriented" approach, that focuses on the reasons <span id="Page_4327"></span>for the position's existence, the inquiry for an administrative secondary position looks at the requirements for selection--specifically whether the agency has required experience as a primary firefighter for entry in the position. Unless the selection criteria include actual experience as a primary firefighter, the position will not qualify for firefighter retirement credit except if the circumstances satisfy the "rare occasions" OPM described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that this result is consistent with the guidance OPM provided when issuing final CSRS regulations on December 17, 1987, that included experience in a primary position as a mandatory prerequisite for secondary administrative firefighting retirement credit. OPM explained that it had received many comments to its proposed regulation on this matter, pointing out that some firefighter positions, such as fire inspectors, have dual career tracks. 52 Fed. Reg. 47893. Specifically, some primary firefighters are often hired as fire inspectors, but others become fire inspectors without first being a firefighter. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Some comments argued that it was unfair to deny early retirement coverage to those that fail to meet the transfer requirement because the agency has a dual career track. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM explained, however, that this issue is an agency staffing decision, and if the position truly does not require experience as a firefighter, it should not be a secondary position, and that if some duties do require that experience, the agency should establish two positions--one that contains the duties and requires the experience, and a different position that does not contain the duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining what evidence the Board will examine to make this determination, we look first to the governing regulations. The regulations, in fact, specifically discuss the evidence to be considered in determining whether a position qualifies for administrative secondary firefighter retirement credit. They provide that a determination that a position serves in a "secondary position" entitled to firefighter service credit "must be based on the official position description and any other evidence deemed appropriate by the agency head for making the determination." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.803(b), 842.804(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellant Scott</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Scott seeks firefighter retirement coverage for his service in the position Program Specialist, GS-0301-10, arguing that the position is either a supervisory or administrative secondary position. He asserts that he is entitled to secondary coverage because his Program Specialist position's duties are no different than the duties he had performed in the covered Fire Chief position he held before his reassignment. He further asserts that he could not perform the duties of his new Program Specialist position without having a firefighting background.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge examined OPM's Handbook, a position classification aid, the position description, and testimonial evidence regarding appellant Scott's day-to-day duties, and concluded that appellant Scott did not show that his position was "clearly in the firefighting field" or that it was a covered supervisory or administrative position. We agree that appellant Scott is not entitled to the firefighter retirement service credit he seeks because his Program Specialist position is neither a supervisory nor administrative secondary position under the governing statute and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A secondary "supervisory" position is "a position whose primary duties are as a first-level supervisor [of] firefighters in rigorous positions." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. As discussed above, the Board will employ the "position-oriented" approach to determine the appellant's entitlement to credit as a "supervisory" firefighter. Thus, the inquiry is whether appellant Scott's Program Specialist position exists to provide first-level supervision of firefighters in rigorous positions. <span class="Italic">See Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1296-97, 1299.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the appellant's position description nor the testimonial evidence supports the conclusion that appellant Scott's position exists to supervise firefighters in rigorous positions. The position description states that the incumbent has overall program responsibility for the facility's Fire Prevention, Inspection and Education program, and includes the following duties: researching and analyzing the fire prevention, inspection and education program; planning and accomplishing special projects involving administrative or support issues; conducting surveys of training needs; administering the training program; making arrangements for training; conducting training evaluation; and developing the training program. None of these duties support the conclusion that this position exists primarily to provide first-level supervision of firefighters in rigorous positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, appellant Scott testified that he "supervises" the city of Hampton's firefighters when they arrive at the agency to combat a fire, and also supervises appellants Blottner and Thomas. He further stated that he generally could not perform the duties of his former or current position without having experience as a firefighter. Although the administrative judge found appellant Scott's testimony incredible, Initial Decision at 6, we find that, even if accepted as true, the testimony does not establish that appellant Scott's position exists primarily to provide first-level supervision of firefighters in rigorous positions. Instead, it shows that he acted as a liaison to the city firefighters and was otherwise generally performing fire prevention and inspection duties. Moreover, the position could not possibly exist to supervise firefighters in rigorous positions because the agency does not have any such employees. Indeed, appellant Scott supervises appellants Blottner and Thomas, and they are seeking firefighter retirement credit for their current positions based upon "administrative" secondary positions and not for primary firefighting in rigorous positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant Scott's position also fails to satisfy the definition of an "administrative" secondary position. As mentioned above, an "administrative" secondary position is "an executive, managerial, technical, semiprofessional, or professional position for which experience in a rigorous firefighting position, or equivalent experience outside the Federal Government, is a mandatory prerequisite." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. The focus of our inquiry is whether experience as a rigorous firefighter is a "mandatory prerequisite" for appellant Scott's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the documentary nor testimonial evidence establishes that experience as a rigorous firefighter was a mandatory prerequisite for entry into appellant Scott's Program Specialist position. While the position description requires "advanced knowledge of fire prevention and protection theory, methods and techniques," it does not specifically require experience in a rigorous firefighting position. Further, the VMAC's Chief of Facilities Management, William McClure, specifically testified that rigorous firefighting experience was not required for appellant Scott's position, and that a safety background would suffice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency has not asked appellant Scott to perform any duties for which a rigorous firefighter background is necessary. While appellant Scott testified that he obtained the required experience for this position by serving as a primary firefighter, and the agency conceded that appellant Scott's firefighting background qualified him for the position, our inquiry is the position's requirements, rather than how the individual obtained the experience necessary to meet the requirement. But, as Mr. McClure explained, while all of the appellants are qualified for their positions based on their firefighting experience, "that need not be the case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the record establishes that experience in a rigorous firefighting position was not a mandatory perquisite for the position and it, therefore, does not constitute an "administrative" secondary position entitling appellant Scott to firefighter retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appellants Blottner and Thomas</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants Blottner and Thomas seek secondary firefighter retirement coverage for service in their positions as a Program Support Assistant and a Fire Protection Inspector, respectively. They argue that these are "administrative" secondary firefighter positions because both positions involve administrative duties requiring the experience they gained as firefighters. They further assert that the administrative judge erroneously distinguished between the firefighting field, the fire inspection field, and the fire education field, and that their duties are precisely the kind of professional and semiprofessional duties anticipated by the governing regulation allowing secondary service credit. They also assert that the agency retained its firefighting mission by retaining fire inspectors and continuing its fire training program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, service in the two positions in question here may only be deemed as "administrative" secondary firefighting positions entitled to firefighter retirement credit if service as a rigorous firefighter is a mandatory prerequisite for the position. Just as in appellant Scott's case, however, neither the documentary nor testimonial evidence establishes that experience as a rigorous firefighter was a mandatory prerequisite for entry into these positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position description for appellant Blottner's Program Support Assistant position does not require rigorous firefighting experience as a mandatory prerequisite. Instead, it requires, among other things, "[p]ractical knowledge of standard procedures in a technical field, requiring extended training or experience, to perform such work as adapting equipment when this requires consideration of the functioning characteristics of equipment," and "[k]nowledge of the basic principles of fire science to access inspection results, observations made, etc." Thus, the position does not specifically require experience as a primary firefighter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McClure specifically testified that a background in firefighting is not required for this position and that he has not asked appellant Blottner to perform any duties that require a rigorous firefighting background. He explained that safety experience, rather than rigorous firefighting experience, is required for the position, and distinguished between "fire science" and firefighting. He testified that "fire science" pertains to knowledge of buildings and facilities, protective equipment, installing alarms and detectors, knowing what may be a fire hazard, and engineering programs dealing with these topics. In contrast, firefighting pertains to the actual training and knowledge necessary to extinguish fires, such as knowing how to use firefighting gear and equipment. While Mr. McClure and appellant Blottner both testified that appellant Blottner <span id="Page_4328"></span>obtained the required knowledge through his work as a firefighter, Mr. McClure explained that the position did not require the experience to be obtained in this fashion. Thus, appellant Blottner's position does not require rigorous firefighting experience as a "mandatory prerequisite," and he is not entitled to the retirement service credit he seeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reach the same conclusion with respect to appellant Thomas's attempt to obtain "administrative" secondary firefighter retirement credit for his service in his Fire Protection Inspector position. This position requires "[s]kills gained through experience or relevant academic study in applying fire science, protection and prevention procedures and techniques" and "knowledge of the basic principles of fire science to assess inspection results, observations made, etc [sic] ," but it does not require experience in a rigorous firefighting position. As with the other appellants, Mr. McClure testified that experience in a rigorous firefighting position is not required, and that while appellant Thomas, in fact, obtained his knowledge of fire science through his prior work as a firefighter, the position does not require that it be obtained in this fashion. Indeed, as discussed above, OPM has explained that agencies have staffing discretion in determining whether an administrative position falls under the firefighter career track and requires rigorous firefighting experience, or determining that actual rigorous firefighting experience is not required to perform the position's duties. 52 Fed. Reg. 47893. Here, the agency has decided to create positions that do not require rigorous firefighting experience and its decision to omit such experience as a mandatory prerequisite precludes firefighter retirement credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Firefighting Mission</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that, even if the specified definitions of "supervisory" and "administrative" secondary positions are satisfied, an incumbent is still not entitled to firefighter retirement service credit unless that service is performed in "an organization having a firefighting mission." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 842.802. Appellants Blottner and Thomas argue that the agency has retained its firefighting mission and point to its retention of fire inspectors and a thorough fire training program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the VMAC affirmatively ended its firefighting mission. Joseph Williams, the Medical Center Director, testified that the Director's Office and the "Network" Director make mission decisions, with the "Network" Director retaining ultimate approval of the decision. He further stated that, when he began serving as Director, the decision had already been made by the previous director to abolish the VMAC's Fire Department and that its firefighting mission ended in October 2001. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> He explained that a firefighting mission requires at least 50% of the time spent on extinguishing fires or supervising those who extinguish fires, that none of the appellants have any authority to make agency mission decisions, that it has no firefighting mission, and that it only performs fire prevention and training functions. Mr. McClure similarly testified that none of the appellants have authority to set the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find this testimony that the agency ended its firefighting mission consistent with its decision to create administrative positions that do not require experience in rigorous firefighting as a mandatory prerequisite. Indeed, there is no need for any firefighting position without a firefighting mission. Finally, we note that, to the extent our analysis may be deemed a narrow interpretation of secondary firefighting positions, the Federal Circuit has held that special retirement coverage must be "strictly construed" to limit coverage. <span class="Italic">See Luke,</span> 320 F.3d at 1383; <span class="Italic">Watson,</span> 262 F.3d at 1298.</p>

Nor does Mr. Jones challenge the decision of the Board that there is no evidence that either the agency or OPM has issued a final decision on a claim by him relating to entitlement to a law enforcement/firefighter annuity.
