<p class="Body-Text">Board jurisdiction over a negative ALOC determination is statutory, 5 USC 5335:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee paid on an annual basis, and occupying a permanent position within the scope of the General Schedule, who has not reached the maximum rate of pay for the grade in which his position is placed, shall be advanced in pay successively to the next higher rate within the grade at the beginning of the next pay period following the completion of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;each 52 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 1, 2, and 3;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;each 104 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 4, 5, and 6; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;each 156 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 7, 8, and 9;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the employee did not receive an equivalent increase in pay from any cause during that period; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"> (B)&#x2003;the work of the employee is of an acceptable level of competence as determined by the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;When a determination is made under subsection (a) of this section that the work of an employee is not of an acceptable level of competence, the employee is entitled to prompt written notice of that determination and an opportunity for reconsideration of the determination within his agency under uniform procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management. If the determination is affirmed on reconsideration, the employee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the reconsideration or appeal results in a reversal of the earlier determination, the new determination supersedes the earlier determination and is deemed to have been made as of the date of the earlier determination. The authority of the Office to prescribe procedures and the entitlement of the employee to appeal to the Board do not apply to a determination of acceptable level of competence made by the Librarian of Congress.</p>

OPM's regulations provide that an employee must seek reconsideration of a decision to withhold a WIGI in writing within 15 days of receiving the decision from the agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.410(a)(1).

Department of the Navy</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 332, 335 (1998).

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 21, 23 (1981)). If the Board finds that the appellant did not present sufficient evidence to justify extending the deadline under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.410(b), the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 336-37; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.410(b) ("The time limit to request a reconsideration may be extended when the employee shows he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that the employee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from requesting reconsideration within the time limit.").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee under the General Schedule earns periodic increases in pay, or WIGIs, as long as her performance is at an acceptable level of competence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(a). When an agency determines that an employee is not performing at an acceptable level of competence and that a WIGI should be withheld, the employee is entitled to "prompt written notice of that determination," and an opportunity for reconsideration under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5385(c). OPM's regulations provide that an employee must seek reconsideration of a decision to withhold a WIGI in writing within 15 days of receiving the decision from the agency. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(a)(1). If the agency affirms its decision to withhold a WIGI on reconsideration, the employee may appeal to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(c). The Board can exercise jurisdiction over an appeal from the withholding of a WIGI only if the agency has affirmed its initial decision on reconsideration<span class="Italic">. Priselac v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 77 MSPR 332, 335 (1998). When an agency has affirmed its WIGI withholding on reconsideration, a Board appeal is due no later than 30 days from the effective date of the decision, if any, or 30 days from the date the employee receives the decision, whichever is later. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appropriate case, an administrative judge may dismiss an appeal as untimely filed without making a definitive determination on jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Popham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 193 (1991). Such an approach may not be appropriate, though, when jurisdiction and timeliness are closely related. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Romine v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 64 MSPR 68, 72 (1994). Here, the administrative judge questioned whether the appellant had received an appealable reconsideration decision, but nevertheless dismissed the appeal as untimely filed without resolving the jurisdictional issue. We hold that such an approach was not appropriate in this particular case. If, as appears from the record, the appellant never received an appealable reconsideration decision, then the period for filing an appeal never began to run, and the appeal would be premature. If we allowed the administrative judge's dismissal on timeliness grounds to become final, and if the appellant later received an appealable reconsideration decision and she appealed again, the agency could argue, paradoxically, that the appellant is collaterally estopped from claiming that her second appeal was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 341 (1995) (issue preclusion can apply to timeliness determinations). Simply put, this appeal cannot be both early and late. If the appeal is premature then a dismissal should reflect that fact, since it would amount to a curable jurisdictional defect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apart from whether the appellant received an appealable reconsideration decision is the question of whether Board jurisdiction is precluded by a negotiated grievance procedure. If an employee is covered by a CBA containing a grievance procedure that does not exclude WIGI withholdings from its coverage, and if the employee does not allege prohibited discrimination, she cannot appeal an agency's decision to withhold a WIGI; instead, the negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive means for resolving the dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Espenschied v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 804 F.2d 1233, 1236-37 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Here, the CBA provisions attached to the appellant's petition for review appear to provide for a right to grieve a WIGI withholding.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Administrative reconsideration is a precondition to Board review. <span class="Italic">Lin v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1225). The MSPB appeal does not arise with the initial denial of a step increase. The right to appeal follows timely but unsuccessful pursuit of the reconsideration process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shaishaa v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 450, 453 (1992); <span class="Italic">Varano v. Dept. of Army</span>, 15 MSPR 472, 472-73 (1983) ("Appellant's alleged disabling condition does not provide a basis for wavier of the regulatory requirement for reconsideration, although it arguably may be pertinent to a determination on the acceptability of a delayed request for reconsideration.."); <span class="italic">cf. Fowlkes v.

To reach the point of a determination appealable to the Board, the ALOC reconsideration request is to be written, not oral, under 5 CFR 531.410(a)(1) (2022). <span class="Italic">Plata v. DOD</span>, 6 MSPR 173, 174 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reaffirmed the necessity of a timely reconsideration request in a WIGI case, and it also reviewed whether an employee's efforts not formally denominated as a reconsideration request might suffice, <span class="Italic">Goines v. MSPB</span>, 258 F.3d 1289, 1292-93 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, under the statute the employee "is entitled to prompt written notice of that determination and an opportunity for reconsideration of the determination within his agency under uniform procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management. If the determination is affirmed on reconsideration, the employee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(c). Although the statute does not explicitly require a request for reconsideration as a condition of appealing the withholding to the Board, that is the reasonable implication of the statutory scheme. In addition, while the legislative history does not directly address this issue, there is nothing in the legislative history that is inconsistent with requiring reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision that an employee may seek reconsideration and that if the within-grade increase is affirmed on reconsideration, the employee may appeal to the Board suggests, if not indicates, that such appeal may be taken only after reconsideration is denied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(5) (The Board has jurisdiction to review a "[r]econsideration decision sustaining a negative determination of competence for [an] employee," citing 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(c)). The provision links the reconsideration to the subsequent appeal to the Board and indicates that the former is a condition of the latter. The requirement that the Office of Personnel Management prescribe uniform procedures for such reconsideration attests to the importance Congress gave to the reconsideration procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Requiring a request for reconsideration as a prerequisite to appeal to the Board serves important purposes. It gives the agency an opportunity to correct, at a higher level, mistakes that have been made in denying within-grade increases, often at a lower level. In the present case, for example, Goines' within-grade increase was withheld by his immediate supervisor, the head of his office, but his request for reconsideration (had he made it) would have been determined by an Assistant Deputy Administrator. Providing such error correction within the agency also avoids burdening the Board with unnecessary appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion is in accord with the settled course of Board decisions, which regularly have held that failure to seek timely reconsideration of a denial of a within-grade increase precludes Board review of the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Priselac v. Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 332, 335 (1998); <span class="Italic">Shaishaa v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 58 MSPR 450, 453 (1992); <span class="Italic">Renshaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Virtually the same issue has arisen in connection with Board review of certain decisions of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM regulations provide that an employee may request reconsideration of an initial OPM decision, that "after reconsideration" OPM will "issue a final decision [that] shall contain notice of the right to request an appeal," and that an individual or agency affected by such final decision "may request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such decision." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 831.109(a), (c), (d), (f), &#x00A7; 831.110. This court described these regulations as "only indirectly" stating that an employee is required to seek reconsideration before invoking the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Toguero v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 982 F.2d 520, 521 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The Board, however, repeatedly has ruled that failure to request reconsideration by OPM precludes it from entertaining the case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Priselac v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Board's notice that within fifteen days he could request reconsideration by Leaman, Goines asked Leaman for a sixty-day extension of time "to prepare my response" and for supporting materials. That letter did not constitute a request for reconsideration. Leaman extended Goines' time to March 22, 2000 and "[e]nclosed copies of the supporting documentation you requested" in a letter dated February 14, 2000. Goines filed nothing further with Leaman.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Goines contends that an earlier letter of his dated January 6, 2000 (two days before his letter to Leaman) constituted a request for reconsideration. That letter, however, related to a different issue and was written to a different official in Goines' agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The January 6 letter was written in response to a November 23, 1999 letter to Goines from the Acting Chief of the Employee Relations Branch in the Human Resources Division proposing to remove him for "failure to meet the requirements for fully successful performance in your position." Goines' thirty-one page reply letter was addressed to James H. Bradley, the Director of the Human Resources Division. Its stated "purpose" was "to provide a rebuttal to the allegations in the November 23, 1999 letter by Diana Bennett, proposing I be removed." Although the letter dealt extensively with Goines' job performance, the Board justifiably concluded that it could not be viewed as a request for reconsideration of the withholding of Goines' within-grade increase.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter informing Goines of the withholding specified that any request for reconsideration would be made by Leaman. There is no reason to believe that anyone in Goines' agency viewed the January 6 letter responding to Goines' proposed removal as also constituting a response to the January 5 letter from his supervisor informing him of the withholding of his within-grade increase.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Goines argues that he did not seek reconsideration by Leaman because he was waiting for his agency to respond to his request for materials, <span id="Page_2980"></span>which presumably he believed he needed for his reconsideration request. Substantial evidence supports the Board's rejection of this claim. As the Board explained, Leaman had already responded on February 14, 2000, stating that the requested information had been provided. Goines did not then inform Leaman that he had not received the information. The administrative judge justifiably credited Leaman's statement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A long delay by an agency in the issuance of a notice of a WIGI denial reconsideration right does not permit circumvention of the reconsideration process in favor of a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Bennett v. DHHS</span>, CH-531D-13-0119-I-1 (NP 2/19/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly argues that the statute requires the agency to give "prompt written notice" of the denial, and we do not condone the agency's lengthy delay, which is made even more troubling by the fact that the agency gave notice only after the appellant happened to discover the SF-50 documenting her WIGI denial during the course of litigating her removal appeal. Nevertheless, these issues are not relevant to the jurisdictional question here. The fact remains that, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the agency's delay, the appellant received notice of the denial and an opportunity to request reconsideration within 15 days. Thus, the only relevant issues are whether the appellant did indeed make a timely request for reconsideration within the 15-day timeframe, and, if she did not, whether the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency's denial of an extension of time to respond was unreasonable....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But failure to provide written notice of the right to reconsideration permits the Board to assume jurisdiction over a WIGI denial appeal, <span class="Italic">Ahuruonye v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DC-531D-14-0587-I-1 (NP 12/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the agency did not grant the appellant a WIGI to step 3, it failed to issue him a notice, as required, that his performance was not at an acceptable level. The agency's actions regarding the appellant's performance rating do not satisfy this requirement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee under the General Schedule earns periodic increases in pay, or WIGIs, as long as his performance is at an acceptable level of competence (ALOC), he has completed the required waiting period, and he has not received an equivalent increase in pay from any cause during that period. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.404. To be performing at an ALOC, the employee's most recent rating of record must be at least fully successful or equivalent. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.404(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an agency determines that an employee is not performing at an ALOC and, as a result his WIGI should be denied, it must issue the employee a negative ALOC determination. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.409(e)(2). Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(a)-(c), an agency is required to make an ALOC determination as of the date the WIGI is due and failure to comply with this requirement is tantamount to a WIGI denial. <span class="Italic">Martinesi v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 276, 280 (1984). The negative ALOC determination must be communicated to the employee in writing as soon as possible after completion of the waiting period, set forth the reasons for the determination and the respects in which the employee must improve his performance to be granted a WIGI, and inform him of his right to request reconsideration of the determination. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.409(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee may seek reconsideration of a negative ALOC determination in writing within 15 days of receiving the determination from the agency. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.410(a)(1).

<p class="Body-Text">Although a grievance protesting a letter of counseling on performance does not meet the regulatory requirements for a request for reconsideration, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 241, 243-44 (1985), an administrative grievance resulting in a decision by the proper reconsideration official provides a basis for the Board's appellate jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Priselac v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 332, 335 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find, contrary to the initial decision, that the appellant received a decision on reconsideration. The appellant's "Administrative Grievance" stated that she was "seeking personal relief in a matter of concern and dissatisfaction relating to...the denial of a within grade," and went on to describe what she thought were the agency's errors in its decision to withhold the WIGI. The agency issued a decision on the grievance. This case differs from <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 29 MSPR 241, 243-44 (1985), where the Board held that a grievance was not an "effective request for reconsideration" of the withholding of the appellant's WIGI because it was not a 'written request to the designated reconsideration official setting forth the reasons for reconsideration." Here, the appellant addressed her grievance to "PEO USW, which stands for "Program Executive Officer for Undersea Warfare," a post held by Timothy Douglass. The appellant had been instructed to send any reconsideration request to Captain William D. Morris, the Deputy Program Executive Officer for Undersea Warfare. Douglass forwarded the grievance to Morris, who issued a decision "as the proper Deciding Official in this matter." Considering that OPM's regulations governing WIGIs do not require that a reconsideration request be submitted to any particular official and do not preclude such a request from being made within the context of an administrative grievance, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410, and given that the agency ensured that the appellant's grievance was directed to and considered by the reconsideration official it had designated in its initial decision to withhold the WIGI, we conclude that Morris's rejection of the grievance is the equivalent of a decision on a reconsideration request.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency fails to act on the WIGI, i.e., it neither grants nor denies the step increase, the appellant may seek Board review; if the issue is whether the agency's delay is justified, a jurisdictional matter, the Board will determine on appeal whether the agency's action is reasonable as part of its jurisdictional determination, <span class="Italic">Cody v. DOJ</span>, 7 MSPR 218, 229, 7 MSPB 127 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A restrictive interpretation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) and 5 CFR 531.407(e) might suggest that the Board has jurisdiction over ALOC appeals only after the agency actually rendered a negative reconsideration decision, as the presiding official found. That view is supported by the plain meaning of the language used in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.407(e), and we believe that it is proper for the Board to decline jurisdiction in most cases where a negative reconsideration decision has not yet been rendered. We find, however, that justice compels a more liberal approach under the circumstances presented in this case, so that our jurisdiction cannot be thwarted indefinitely by sheer delay on the agency's part in rendering an ALOC determination. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(e)(2) (limiting the processing time for a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to 120 days, after which the Board's jurisdiction attaches). Postponing an ALOC determination and a within-grade step increase in salary for a period in excess of eighteen months, when the employee has requested at least twice that an ALOC determination be made as required by law and that his increase be granted, has the same practical effect as a negative ALOC determination and a negative reconsideration decision. Under circumstances such as these, therefore, we find that the Board does have jurisdiction over the ALOC appeal, at least to the extent of ordering the agency to make a retroactive ALOC determination in accordance with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.407(h).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spellman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 439, 441-44 (1988), provided jurisdictional analysis of a claim that a step increase was effectively denied through indefinite postponement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction to review negative WGI determinations generally attaches only after the agency has issued a reconsideration decision. 5 USC &#x00A7; 5335(c); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(d); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 1 MSPR 505, 509 (1980). In this case, the agency issued neither a negative ALOC determination nor reconsideration decision. The WGI determination was merely postponed until the appellant complied with the applicable waiting period requirements. The appellant, therefore, does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements for appealing a WGI denial to the Board. Further, the administrative judge correctly held that the Board lacks jurisdiction over an allegation of discrimination unless it is advanced in connection with a matter over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army,</span> 2 MSPB 174, 2 MSPR 1 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 681 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the Board has consistently held that it has jurisdiction to determine whether the agency improperly denied an appellant the right to a determination on his or her level of competence, or a reconsideration decision on that determination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Renshaw v. Department of the</span> Army, 23 MSPR 441 (1984); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Veterans Administration,</span> 21 MSPR 409 (1984); <span class="Italic">Bueschel v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 6 MSPB 633, 7 MSPR 21 (1981). If the Board did not do so, an agency which improperly failed to grant a WGI could also frustrate indefinitely its employees' right to seek Board review of the propriety of that action. In reviewing such an appeal, however, the Board has stated that it will assert jurisdiction over the underlying action, as opposed to asserting only an initial jurisdiction to determine whether it may review the merits, only if it finds that the agency acted unreasonably<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. We find, therefore, that while the appellant's allegation of discrimination may not be examined as such, it may be reviewed as a claim that the agency acted unreasonably.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Earlier Board cases involving this issue have generally centered on the appellant's failure to request a reconsideration decision or to request one in a timely manner, or the agency's failure to inform the employee that he had the right to reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Morganti v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 11 MSPB 203, 12 MSPR 589 (1982); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force,</span> 7 MSPB 150, 7 MSPR 150 (1981); <span class="Italic">Gerard v. Department of Transportation,</span> 6 MSPB 648, 7 MSPR 40 (1981). While the instant case differs from those to some extent with respect to the reason for the absence of a reconsideration decision, the Board finds no reason to treat this case differently for purposes of analyzing the threshold issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge stated, it is the appellant who has the burden of proof on the issue of Board jurisdiction. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . The record reveals that the agency based its denial of appellant's WGI on her failure to complete the regulatorily-mandated amount of service, requiring the extension of her waiting period. The appellant has not challenged the propriety of the agency's application of the regulation, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.406(a)(2), and the record fully supports the determination that appellant failed to complete the requisite waiting period because of her excess leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to meet her burden of showing that the agency acted unreasonably, the appellant asserts that if she had been allowed to work during her pregnancy, her WGI would not have been delayed. Before the administrative judge appellant made no specific factual argument in support of her assertion of jurisdiction beyond stating that if she had been allowed to work in a safe area she could have continued to work. Prior to the appellant's response to the show cause order, however, the agency submitted both the letter she sent to the agency in which she asked for leave without pay and the doctor's letter supporting it. Contrary to her current position, neither document suggests that it was premised on the agency's refusal to accommodate her or was in any way caused by the agency. Moreover, the physician stated that the appellant must remain at home because of complications due to an irritable uterus caused by the presence of small tumors. He spoke of the "nocuous chemicals to which she was exposed" only in terms of their exacerbation of her sinus problem. Nothing in the appellant's submission suggests that her pregnancy-related problems were caused or exacerbated by her work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this record, the Board finds that appellant's showing fails to amount to proof of unreasonableness or a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction which might entitle her to further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, although not addressed by the administrative judge or the parties, the appellant's WGI had originally been awarded. It was later cancelled when the agency realized its error. The cancellation alone provides no basis for Board jurisdiction, however. <span class="Italic">See Henry v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 33 MSPR 562, 564 (1987) (correction of an administrative error in setting a pay step, absent proof of deceit by the agency, does not give the Board jurisdiction over a reduction in pay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency delay of nine months on a reconsideration request allowed the Board to assume jurisdiction without remand to the agency. <span class="Italic">Gerard v. FAA</span>, 7 MSPR 40, 42, 6 MSPB 648 (1981) (agency received but did not act on a reconsideration request because it was sent to someone other than the reconsideration official; the employee was not advised that the request was to go to the reconsideration official). Seven months of delay between the denial of a step increase and written notification and justification for the agency's action warranted assumption by the Board of immediate jurisdiction without requiring the appellant to pursue an internal agency ALOC reconsideration process in <span class="Italic">Jack v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 98 MSPR 354, 357-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (2005), noting that 5 USC 5335(c) requires "prompt" written notice and opportunity for reconsideration; no exceptions are provided for employees on administrative leave or any other type of leave. The same result was reached as to a three-month delay. <span class="Italic">Morganti v. DHHS</span>, 12 MSPR 589, 591 (1982). If, after some delay, the appellant appeals the denial of the WIGI before the reconsideration decision is issued, and the agency grants the WIGI, the appeal is moot and it will be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Jazdzewski v. USDA</span>, 35 MSPR 541, 542 (1987).

<p class="Body-Text">In a decision that made no attempt to square its analysis with the decisions just discussed on untimely action on step increases, the Board had no jurisdiction over the delay in the grant of a WIGI, although the facts of the appeal involved a retroactive correction as to a step increase, not a denial of the step increase, <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 105 MSPR 663, 668-69 &#x00B6; 10, 2007 MSPB 139 (2007) (overruled in part on other grounds by <span class="italic">Brookins v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant asserts that her appeal is not an appeal of a denial of a within-grade increase, but rather, an appeal of a delay in the payment of her within-grade increase. Generally, the Board has jurisdiction, under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75, to review actions involving reductions in pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(4), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 254, 258 (1992).

The appellant has never claimed in this appeal that her pay was lowered, merely that her increase in pay was not timely remitted to her. We find, therefore, that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that she suffered a reduction in pay and, thus, she is not entitled to her requested hearing to establish adverse action jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Caven v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 392 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">If the employee's reconsideration request is untimely, the agency will not adjudicate the request and the Board will not adjudicate the appeal. 5 CFR 531.410(b) (2022) allows exceptions to the period for filing these requests if the appellant was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, or if the request was filed late for reasons beyond appellant's control. If a late reconsideration request is made and denied, the Board will accept the appeal only if it finds that the agency unreasonably rejected the request. <span class="Italic">Bueschel v. SSA</span>, 7 MSPR 21, 23, 6 MSPB 633 (1981) (burden was on the appellant to demonstrate that her circumstances fell within one of the exceptions identified in OPM regulation permitting a belated reconsideration request); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 7 MSPR 150, 153 (1981) (ALOC appeal dismissed when the agency failed to grant the appellant a further extension of time to request reconsideration after approximately two months of extensions). <span class="Italic">Priselac v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 332, 336-37 (1998), provided the Board's summary of decisions involving allegedly untimely reconsideration requests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A request for reconsideration of the decision to withhold a WIGI must be made "not more than 15 days after [the employee's] recei[pt] of the notice" that the WIGI is being withheld. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(a)(1). The 15-day deadline "may be extended when the employee shows he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that the employee was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from requesting reconsideration within the time limit." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(b). As noted above, the appellant submitted her reconsideration request almost six months after the initial notification that her WIGI had been withheld. Morris rejected the request on the ground that it had not been submitted by the 15-day deadline for filing an administrative grievance under agency rules. For purposes of this appeal we deem him to have also rejected it as not having been filed by the 15-day deadline under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency denies a request for reconsideration of the withholding of a WIGI because it was not submitted by the regulatory deadline, the Board will review the record that was before the agency to determine whether the denial was unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Bueschel v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 6 MSPB 633, 7 MSPR 21, 23 (1981). If the Board finds that the appellant did not present sufficient evidence to justify extending the deadline under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(b), the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 23-24 (interpreting the predecessor to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.410(b)). It appears that the appellant was notified of the time limit for seeking reconsideration, and it does not appear that she presented any evidence to the agency that would have warranted extending the deadline. Still, we cannot decide on this record whether the agency acted unreasonably or abused its discretion in not extending the time limit, because the appellant was not put on notice by the acknowledgment order, any of the agency's pleadings, or the initial decision that in order to establish jurisdiction she must show that the agency acted unreasonably or abused its discretion in not extending the time limit....&#8197;Accordingly, the appeal must be remanded....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant files a reconsideration request and the agency grants the WIGI by an SF-50, but later than the date of the appellant's first eligibility for the step increase, the time to appeal runs from the time the appellant is then on notice that the WIGI will not be fully granted. Since there is no notice of Board appeal rights with the SF-50, the appellant is then charged with filing a Board appeal when he learns of his appeal right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Munson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 90 MSPR 583, 588 &#x00B6; 13 (2002), <span class="Italic">on appeal,</span> <span class="Italic">Munson v. MSPB</span>, 318 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (reversing the Board's decision that the appellant filed an untimely appeal when the agency neither provided a reconsideration decision to the appellant nor informed him of the time limit for initiating a Board appeal).</p>
