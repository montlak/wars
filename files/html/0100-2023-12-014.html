<p class="Body-Text">If a discrimination issue is raised during the course of an appeal, the case must be treated as a "mixed case" under 5 USC 7702. The AJ must address all issues of discrimination raised by the appeal, <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 586, 587, 2 MSPB 1 (1980), unless the affirmative defenses have been abandoned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mata v. Dept. of Army</span>, 114 MSPR 6, 9-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 2010 MSPB 70 (2010) (remanding for consideration of EEO affirmative defense that was timely raised, but not considered, when the AJ adjudicated an adverse action appeal from a removal with an IRA appeal involving other personnel actions); <span class="Italic">Kokkinis v. VA</span>, 81 MSPR 26, 29 &#x00B6; 10 (1998) ("An issue of a prohibited personnel practice is a material issue of fact and law."); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 593, 597 (1988) ("Congress has expressly mandated, at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a), that the Board render decisions on discrimination allegations raised in connection with otherwise appealable actions."); <span class="Italic">Nordell v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 37, 41 (1983) ("The record discloses no basis for a finding that appellant abandoned these affirmative [EEO] defenses, and we therefore hold that the presiding official erred when he did not consider them."). "Generally, an appellant is deemed to have abandoned a discrimination claim if it is not included in the list of issues in a prehearing conference summary, or status conference summary, and the party was afforded an opportunity to object to the conference summary." <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 264, 266 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (still finding no abandonment of an EEO defense); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 4, 16 &#x00B6; 24 (2003) (appellant specifically disclaimed discrimination or reprisal allegations concerning her removal; even a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant bears responsibility for providing specificity regarding the bases for her claims).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The duty of an AJ to analyze EEO or other prohibited practice defenses raised but not abandoned was summarized in an appeal involving both EEO and union reprisal defenses when the AJ addressed the former but not the latter, <span class="Italic">Gath v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 124, 127-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2012 MSPB 68 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant raises an affirmative defense in an appeal either by checking the appropriate box in an appeal form, identifying an affirmative defense by name, such as "race discrimination," "harmful procedural error," etc., or by alleging facts that reasonably raise such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense(s) in any <span id="Page_1613"></span>close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. <span class="Italic">Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). If an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must, at a minimum, in the close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give the appellant an opportunity to object to withdrawal of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Wynn</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant clearly alleged below that the agency removed him in retaliation for engaging both in protected EEO activity as well as protected union activity. However, the administrative judge did not consider the appellant's affirmative defense of retaliation for protected union activity in her initial decision, and there is no indication in the record that the administrative judge addressed the affirmative defense in a close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. Thus, the record does not establish that the appellant withdrew or abandoned that affirmative defense, and remand for further adjudication of the affirmative defense is necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The duty of the AJ to identity burdens of proof as to affirmative defenses not withdrawn exists even when the appellant is represented by counsel, <span class="Italic">Stockton v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-1025-I-3 (NP 10/9/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted in his initial appeal that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) when it proposed his removal and issued a removal decision in retaliation for his involvement in protected activity. The appellant was not informed of his burden for establishing the affirmative defense. The administrative judge issued a prehearing conference summary, in which he stated that the appellant was not asserting any affirmative defenses, but it did not state that the appellant had abandoned his affirmative defense of EEO retaliation. Although he was given an opportunity to respond to the summary, the appellant, who was represented by counsel, failed to do so. The initial decision did not address his affirmative defense. On petition for review, the appellant now asserts that the administrative judge failed to adjudicate his claim of EEO retaliation. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge did not give the appellant proper notice regarding his affirmative defense and it thus is necessary to remand the appeal for further adjudication of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Gath</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDermott v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0633-I-1 (NP 10/13/2015) ("When an appellant raises an affirmative defense in an appeal either by checking the appropriate box in an appeal form, identifying an affirmative defense by name, such as 'race discrimination,' 'harmful procedural error,' etc., or by alleging facts that reasonably raise such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must address the affirmative defense(s) in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. <span class="Italic">Gath v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 11 (2012). If an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw such an affirmative defense, the administrative judge must, at a minimum, in the close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give the appellant an opportunity to object to the withdrawal of the affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Apparently the duty to analyze discrimination issues exists whether or not discrimination is pleaded as an affirmative defense, as long as there is evidence relating to a discrimination issue. If an appellant is regarded as having a physical disability, the AJ must determine whether the agency made reasonable accommodation of the appellant's perceived disabling condition irrespective of whether the appellant concurs with the assessment made of his condition. <span class="Italic">Lindberg v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 1 MSPR 711, 712, 2 MSPB 120 (1980). An allegation of discrimination in a retirement appeal must be resolved by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Caldarone v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 544, 546 (1988). An AJ must also resolve a discrimination defense to an indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 398, 407 (1995), even if it is based on denial of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 130, 134 &#x00B6; 10 (2000) (as to an indefinite suspension imposed for the lack of a security clearance and reversed because the clearance was lifted without due process: "An administrative judge must consider an appellant's claims of discrimination, regardless of whether, as here, the adverse action is reversed on procedural grounds."). If an AJ determines that an appeal is not within the Board's jurisdiction, no findings should be made on an affirmative defense of discrimination under 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(B). That section is not an independent basis of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245, 249 n.10 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal involving a discrimination defense involves an allegation both of a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(1) and an allegation of a violation of EEO laws. To establish a violation of these laws, the appellant must demonstrate that he was engaged in activity protected by the appropriate section, that he was subsequently treated in an adverse fashion by the employer, and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and adverse action. The AJ should analyze the discrimination issues according to these elements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mallory v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 135, 140 (1988) (remanding because of the AJ's failure to analyze a defense based upon union animus; the AJ did not address specific examples of bias raised by the appellant); <span class="Italic">Perkins v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 576, 578, 4 MSPB 93 (1980) ("[T]he appellant must demonstrate that he was engaged in activity protected by the appropriate section, that he was subsequently treated in adverse fashion by the employer, and that there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. The presiding official did not analyze appellant's appeal as set forth above, nor did he make any findings appropriate to the analysis."). If an individual alleges that an adverse action was in reprisal for the filing of a discrimination complaint, the AJ must analyze the case and make findings of whether the retaliation was a significant factor in the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Prince v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 596, 3 MSPB 113, 598 (1980) (citing <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPR 163, 1 MSPB 159 (1979)).

<p class="Body-Text">The AJ must analyze evidence, not jump to a conclusion that the appellant failed to prove a connection between the discipline imposed and her protected activity, <span class="Italic">Afifi v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 33 MSPR 287, 290 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our review of the initial decision reveals no indication that the administrative judge did in fact consider that evidence. The record contains a number of exhibits documenting the ratification of unauthorized purchases by other employees. Yet the administrative judge has not explained why he concluded that these situations were dissimilar. Rather, the initial decision contains mere conclusory statements that the appellant did not prove a connection between the discipline imposed and her previous protected activity. The Board therefore is not able to review the administrative judge's reasoning in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980) (initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve all material issues in a manner that reveals the reasoning and authorities upon which the administrative judge's conclusions rest). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1) (in order to provide an adequate basis for Board review, the administrative judge's initial decision must contain "[f]indings of fact and conclusions, as well as reasons or bases therefor, upon all material issues of fact and law presented on the record").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stressing that conclusions concerning EEO allegations are insufficient without evidentiary and legal analysis, under <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 47 MSPR 461, 464 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge erred in failing to provide an analysis in support of his summary conclusion that the appellant's allegation of reprisal for his protected activity was without merit. An initial decision must identify all material issues of fact, summarize evidence on each such issue sufficiently to disclose the evidentiary basis for the administrative judge's findings of fact, set forth those findings clearly, describe the application of burdens of proof, and address all material legal issues in a fashion that reveals the administrative judge's conclusions of law, legal reasoning and the authorities on which that reasoning rests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge's finding with regard to the appellant's allegation of reprisal for engaging in protected activities falls short of the standard described above. Although the administrative judge called the appellant's claim "a complete sham and without a scintilla of foundation" and "an abuse of process and a desperate attempt to cover his own misconduct," he made no reference to the appellant's evidence in support of his allegation, and did not attempt to apply the burdens and standards of proof applicable to allegations of reprisal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Anderson v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 522, 525-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2010 MSPB 73 (2010), remanded an appeal because the AJ insufficiently analyzed an EEO affirmative defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges on review that the agency's proffered reason for the removal was a pretext for retaliation for her equal employment opportunity activity. She also contends that "[b]ecause the administrative judge did not pass on this issue, the matter should be remanded for consideration of Appellant's allegation of retaliation." The initial decision's analysis of the retaliation claim merely finds that "the Agency has established by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have removed Appellant absent knowledge of any protected activity," and that "[t]herefore, I need not reach the issue of whether Appellant has proven a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests. <span class="Italic">Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980). The initial decision in this case does not meet that standard. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 461, 464 (1991). Whether the agency retaliated against the appellant is a factual matter that may require the assessment of the credibility of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See Garrison v. Department of the Navy,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 389, &#x00B6; 10 (2001). The administrative judge who heard the testimony firsthand and observed the demeanor of the witnesses is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses. <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the case has gone to a hearing and the evidentiary record is complete, the administrative judge will not inquire into whether the action under review could have been retaliatory, whether the appellant has made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation, or whether some other threshold of proof has been met so as to shift the burden to the agency. <span class="Italic">See Simien v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 28 (2005). Rather, the inquiry proceeds to the ultimate question, which is whether, upon weighing the evidence presented by both parties, the appellant has met her overall burden of proving retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Berry v. Department of Commerce,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 10 (2007) (the ultimate question is whether the appellant has demonstrated by preponderant evidence that the agency's reason for its actions was a pretext for retaliation). Evidence to be considered at this stage may include: (1) the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) any evidence the employee presents to attack the employer's proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of retaliation that may be available to the employee, such as independent evidence of retaliatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer, or any contrary evidence that may be available to the employer. <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 17 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may avoid the problem of the omitted finding in an initial decision on an EEO issue by making the finding on the basis of the evidence, or lack of it, in the record when the case reaches the Board through a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Daniel v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 599, 604 (1990) (EEO allegation); <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 508, 510-11 (1989) (disability discrimination allegation); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 259, 263 (1982) (although the appellant asserted discrimination, and the AJ erred by failing to analyze the issue, the appellant was not harmed since he offered no evidence to support the allegation). If the Board travels that route, it will consider only the evidence and arguments offered at the regional level; the Board will not consider issues raised for the first time in the PFR unless they qualify as "new." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 369, 372 (1991) (EEO allegation). At times the AJ fails to adjudicate EEO issues but the Board decides not to remand because the appellant essentially abandoned the claims before the AJ. In <span class="Italic">Begay v. DHHS</span>, 52 MSPR 447, 448 (1992), the AJ failed to adjudicate the EEO defense, but on PFR the Board concluded that the appellant failed to carry her burden of proof on those issues by not identifying the bases of the alleged discrimination or prohibited personnel practices, and by not pursuing either of those claims before the AJ. In <span class="Italic">Momon v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 590, 592 n.2 (1992), the Board observed that the appellant suffered no prejudice when the AJ failed to rule on an EEO claim that was no more than a "bare allegation of age discrimination." [Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-006.html#sec12-7">Authority of Judge to Strike Frivolous EEO Allegation; Summary Judgment</a>"; in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-12-125.html#sec5-124">Review of New Evidence</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-12-143.html#sec5-142">Review of New Issues or Issues Not Raised With Judge</a>," concerning evidence and issues raised for the first time in a PFR.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an appellant fail to present evidence in support of an affirmative defense, e.g., a prohibited personnel practice, the AJ may properly consider the charge to have been abandoned. <span class="Italic">Eng v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 220, 221 (1983); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hauges v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 407, 409 (1989) (although the AJ did not address an EEO allegation raised in an appeal, the record on the PFR demonstrated no support for the allegation and the appellant did not meet his burden of proof on an affirmative defense). But if the EEO issue is litigated on the merits, the AJ may not dispose of it by "dismissing" the affirmative defense. Dismissal is saved for cases not adjudicated on the merits, e.g., appeals dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or untimeliness. The allegation of a prohibited personnel practice is decided against the appellant by a finding that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proof. <span class="Italic">Sadowski v. DLA</span>, 40 MSPR 655, 659 (1989). Even if alleged discrimination raised in the appeal is not supported by any evidence during the hearing, the initial decision must make a specific finding dismissing the allegation for lack of proof or for failure to make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 376 n.2 (1988). If there is no proof of discrimination, however, the failure of the AJ to resolve the issue will not be considered sufficiently significant to adversely affect the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 132, 141 &#x00B6; 17 (1999) (AJ erred by not addressing a reprisal claim, but the error was not harmful because the appellant offered no supporting evidence); <span class="Italic">Bisarra v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 203, 205 (1992) (appellant's substantive rights were unaffected by the AJ's omission of rulings on the appellant's discrimination allegations; those allegations were unidentified by type, they were wholly unexplained, and they were unaccompanied by any supporting evidence other than the EEO complaints filed by the appellant).
