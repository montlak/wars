<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-75"><span class="space">a.</span> Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 86 MSPR 501, 503, 506-510 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 9-17, 1-4 (2000) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3435)), considered the impact on continuation of employment of several individuals who worked with or around Indian children. A statute was enacted to protect these children by conditioning employment on maintenance of minimum standards of character, including records clear of specific offenses involving moral turpitude and "crimes against persons." The statute supported removal, and precluded mitigation of removal, of employees who came within the statutory proscription:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellants from their positions of employment based on violations of the minimum standards of character under the Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act, Pub. L. No. 101-630, 1990 USCCAN (104 Stat.) 4544, codified at 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207 (the "Act" or "statute"). As fully set forth in the analysis section of this decision, the Act requires the agency to "compile a list of all authorized positions...the duties and responsibilities of which involve regular contact with, or control over, Indian children..." ("covered position") and to "conduct an investigation of the character of each individual who is employed or is being considered for employment" in a covered position. 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207(a). The statute states that "[t]he minimum standards of character...shall ensure that none of the individuals appointed to [covered] positions...have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere, or guilty to, any <span class="Italic">offense</span> under federal, state, or tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact or prostitution, or crimes against persons" ("covered crimes"). 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue presented is whether the agency correctly interpreted the language of the Act as requiring the removal of the appellants from covered positions because they had been found guilty of, or had entered a plea of no contest or guilty to, covered crimes....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judges' interpretation of 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207 is erroneous as a matter of law because it is contrary to the plain meaning of the language in the statute. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the administrative judges erred by relying on the BIA regulations and finding that the adjudicating agency official has discretion to consider mitigating factors when determining whether an employee should be removed based on a violation of the minimum standard of character under the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point of every case involving statutory construction must be the language of the statute itself....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984), the Supreme Court provided the framework under which a court is to review an agency's construction of a statute that it administers. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the Board must follow a two-step process in its review. The first step is to determine whether Congress has spoken directly to the issue through the language of the statute<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. "If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board reaches the second step only if it finds that Congress did not directly address the issue in question and the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue. The second step is to determine whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 843. If the construction is permissible, the reviewing authority should defer to the agency's interpretation. We conclude that the initial decisions improperly reversed the mandated order of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, we must first look at the applicable language of the statute. The pertinent portion of the statutory language is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00A7; 3207.&#x2003;Character investigations</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;By Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;compile a list of all authorized positions within their respective departments the duties and responsibilities of which involve regular contact with, or control over, Indian children,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;conduct an investigation of the character of each individual who is employed, or is being considered for employment, by the respective Secretary in a position listed pursuant to paragraph (1), and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;prescribe by regulations minimum standards of character that each of such individuals must meet to be appointed to such positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Criminal records</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The minimum standards of character that are to be prescribed under this section shall ensure that none of the individuals appointed to positions described in subsection (a) of this section have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any offense under Federal, State, or tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact or prostitution; or crimes against persons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">25 USC &#x00A7; 3207. We begin by addressing whether section 3207 applies to both current and prospective employees. We reject the administrative judge's finding...that the statute only covers new appointments. Because subsection (b) states that the minimum standards apply to "individuals appointed to positions described in subsection (a)" and because subsection (a) refers to "each individual who is employed, or is being considered for employment" in a covered position, we find that the minimum standards apply to both current and prospective employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Johnson argued that the term "crimes against persons" means multiple crimes or acts. We reject this interpretation because it distorts the plain language of the Act. The statute requires that the minimum standards of character ensure that none of the individuals appointed to covered positions have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of no contest or guilty to, "any offense under Federal, State, or tribal law involving crimes of violence; sexual assault, molestation, exploitation, contact or prostitution; or crimes against persons." 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207(b) (emphasis added). The key word in this provision is "offense," which is in the singular form. We note that the plural terms, "crimes of violence" and "crimes against persons," refer to a category of crimes that Congress intended to be within the purview of the statute. We find that the term "crimes against persons" describes one type of offense that is actionable under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the main issue of whether the language of section 3207 mandated the removal actions. In subsection (a)(3), Congress authorized the agency to "prescribe by regulations minimum standards of character." By using the word "shall" in subsection (b), it mandated that those standards must "ensure that none of the individuals appointed to [covered] positions...have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to,..." a covered crime. 25 USC &#x00A7; 3207(b). The only way to "ensure" that none of the individuals appointed to a covered position have been "found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to," a covered crime is to make that prohibition the base eligibility requirement for obtaining and/or retaining employment in a covered position. Therefore, under its plain meaning, we find that section 3207(b) requires, as the minimum eligibility standard for holding a covered position ("the minimum standard"), that the individual who is employed, or is being considered for employment, must not have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, a covered crime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellants' argument that the plain language of the statute does not include the words "remove" or "dismiss" is technically correct, we find that two necessary conclusions naturally follow from the plain meaning of subsection 3207(b): (1) if an individual who is being considered for employment does not meet the minimum standard, he cannot be appointed to a covered position; and (2) if an individual who is employed in a covered position fails to meet the minimum standard, he cannot continue to be appointed to that position. If a character investigation discloses that an individual has violated the minimum standard, removal from the covered position is required under the language of the statute because that is the only way to "ensure" that "none of the individuals appointed to [covered] positions...have been <span id="Page_2521"></span>found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to," a covered crime. Neither the appellants nor the administrative judges indicated how the statutory mandate could otherwise be satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation of section 3207 is supported by section 3201 of the Act. Section 3201(a) provides, in pertinent part, that, after holding hearings on the problem of child abuse on Indian reservations, Congress found that multiple incidents of sexual abuse of Indian children had been perpetrated by Federal employees and that Federal background investigations of Federal employees who care for Indian children had been deficient. 25 USC &#x00A7; 3201(a)(1)(C) and (D). The language and history of the Act show that Congress intended to afford the maximum protection for Indian children and that there were concerns about incidents where Federal employees had abused them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the statute's purpose is clearly protective, rather than punitive. In section 3201(a)(2)(A), Congress declared that one of its major goals is to identify the scope of incidents of abuse of Indian children and "<span class="Italic">to reduce such incidents.</span>" 25 USC &#x00A7; 3201(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The Act identifies a narrow category of individuals, those who have been convicted of or pled no contest or guilty to, a covered crime, and ensures that those individuals do not hold positions within the agency where their duties will involve contact with or control over Indian children. This serves the overall goals of the Act, to prevent child abuse, and protect Indian children. Additionally, we note that one of the stated purposes of the Act is to "authorize <span class="Italic">such other actions as are necessary to ensure effective child protection</span> in Indian country" and on Indian reservations. 25 USC &#x00A7; 3201(b)(3) and (9) (emphasis added). Given this Congressional statement, we find no valid basis in the appellants' argument for prohibiting new appointments while not terminating the appointments of those holding covered positions who have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of no contest or guilty to, a covered crime. In order to enforce the minimum standard under section 3207(b), we find that, if a character investigation reveals that an individual who holds a covered position has violated the minimum standard, removal from that position is a necessary action to ensure effective Indian child protection and to reduce incidents of Indian child abuse perpetrated by Federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellants held covered positions and that they each violated the minimum standard of character by either being convicted of, or pleading guilty or no contest to a crime that is classified as a crime against persons. We find that the agency properly removed the appellants from their positions as required by the plain language of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nexus limitation imposed by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a), requires an agency to show by preponderant evidence "the necessary connection between the employee's off duty misconduct and the employee's job-related responsibilities." <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 768 F.2d 334, 335-36 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Nexus may be shown in one of three ways: (1) a rebuttable presumption of nexus that may arise in certain egregious circumstances based on the nature and gravity of the conduct; (2) a showing by preponderant evidence that the conduct affects the employee's or his coworkers' job performance, or management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; or (3) a showing by preponderant evidence that the conduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission<span class="Italic">. Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 74 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, by enacting the mandatory language of section 3207, we find that Congress created a presumption of nexus between an employee's violation of the minimum standard of character and appointment to or continued service in a covered position. Section 3207 reflects the view of Congress that prohibiting individuals who have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of no contest or guilty to, a covered crime from holding a covered position promotes the efficiency of the agency's service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants Daugherty and Delong argued that a nexus could not be presumed because the violations of the minimum standard of character occurred more than ten years ago. Further, all of the appellants asserted that it is undisputed that the violations never affected their job performance, or management's trust and confidence in them. Although we acknowledge that the removals were unrelated to the appellants' job performance, nevertheless, because the language of the statute does not limit its coverage to a specific time period, we disagree with their assertion that nexus cannot be presumed. We find that the appellants' claims are insufficient to rebut the presumption of nexus and that the history and purpose of the statute establish the vital connection between the appellants' off duty conduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the appellants' claims that the penalty of removal is unreasonable and that it should be mitigated. The Board has held that it has authority to reduce the penalty imposed by an agency if certain mitigating circumstances exist<span class="Italic">. Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280 (1981). However, in the circumstances of these cases, the plain meaning of section 3207 prohibits individuals from holding an appointment to a covered position if they have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of no contest or guilty to, a covered crime. Further, the agency showed that there were no other positions to which the appellants could have been reassigned, given the number of its positions that involve contact with Indian children. Accordingly, we find that the agency was justified in removing them, and we sustain the removal actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board interpretation of the operation of 25 USC 3207 was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Delong v. DHHS</span>, 264 F.3d 1334, 1338-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001), applying the statutory employment bar to conduct that occurred before enactment of the statute, and precluding mitigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The plain language of the statute demonstrates that it applies to current employees. Section 3207(a)(2) requires HHS to "conduct an investigation of each individual who is employed...in a [covered] position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 3207(a)(3) requires HHS to "prescribe by regulations minimum standards of character that each of such individuals must meet to be appointed to such positions," and &#x00A7; 3207(b) requires the minimum standards to "ensure that none of the individuals appointed to [covered] positions...have been found guilty of, or entered a plea of nolo contendere or guilty to, any [enumerated crime]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Delong argues that the "to be appointed to" language of &#x00A7; 3207(a)(3) and &#x00A7; 3207(b) indicates that the minimum standards of character apply to prospective employees only. However, current employees also may be considered to "be appointed" to their positions. Moreover, the term "such individuals" in &#x00A7; 3207(a)(3) refers back to the phrase "each individual who is employed, or is being considered for employment" in preceding subsection &#x00A7; 3207(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of &#x00A7; 3207 also makes it clear that enumerated crimes committed prior to its enactment violate the minimum standards of character. Section 3207(a) requires the agency to investigate the character of current employees. Such investigation would not be necessary if an employee's past conduct were irrelevant to whether that employee meets the minimum standards of character required by the Act. Moreover, &#x00A7; 3207(b) requires the agency to "ensure that none of the individuals appointed to [covered] positions...have been <span class="Italic">found guilty of</span>...[an enumerated crime]." (emphasis added). This language clearly requires HHS to consider crimes committed prior to enactment of the Act when determining whether an employee satisfies the minimum standards of character.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation of &#x00A7; 3207 is reinforced by the findings and purposes behind the Act, which are set forth in &#x00A7; 3201. As noted by the Board, one of the findings behind the Act recognized that "multiple incidents of sexual abuse of children on Indian reservations have been...perpetrated by persons employed by the Federal government." 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3201(a)(1)(C) (1990). That finding reflects Congress's concern that current federal employees may pose a threat to Indian children. Another finding recognized that "investigations of the background of Federal employees who care for...Indian children are often deficient," <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3201(a)(1)(D). That finding suggests that Congress also was concerned that some current federal employees might not be fit for employment in positions covered by the Act due to their past criminal conduct. Interpreting &#x00A7; 3207 as applying to current employees and as requiring the consideration of past criminal conduct also furthers one of the "major goals" of the Act, "reduc[ing the] incidents...of abuse of children...in Indian country," <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3201 (a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Delong argues that &#x00A7; 3207 does not require HHS to remove current employees who fail to meet the minimum standards of character, but instead permits HHS to consider mitigating circumstances that might establish the employee's fitness for continued employment in a covered position, notwithstanding the employee's criminal record. We are unable to discern any language in &#x00A7; 3207 that supports Ms. Delong's construction of the statute. Section 3207(b) requires HHS to "ensure that none of the individuals appointed to [covered) positions...have been found guilty of...[an enumerated crime]." The only way HHS can "ensure" that current employees meet the minimum standards of character is to remove employees who fail to meet the standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Interpreting &#x00A7; 3207 as requiring HHS to remove current employees who violate the Act's minimum standards of character does not render the statute unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A federal employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7501 (1994), "has a property right in [her] continued employment." <span class="Italic">King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). That property right entitles the employee to procedural due process protections under the Fifth Amendment. <span class="Italic">King v. Erickson</span>, 89 F.3d 1575, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262 (1988). "When an agency brings charges against an employee, compliance with [the procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)] satisfies the minimum due process requirements to which the employee is entitled." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Ms. Delong does not argue that her procedural due process rights were violated, nor could she. HHS provided her with "at least 30 days' advance written notice...stating the reasons for the proposed action," afforded her "a reasonable time to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits...in support of the answer," permitted <span id="Page_2522"></span>her to be represented by an attorney, and provided her with "a written decision and the specific reasons therefore." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b). Instead, as noted, Ms. Delong argues that the statute violates her substantive due process rights by creating an irrebuttable presumption that, because of her criminal record, she is unfit for service in a covered position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to evaluate the merits of this argument, we must determine what level of protection the Constitution provides to Ms. Delong's property interest in her federal employment. Ms. Delong asserts that her federal employment is a fundamental right and that, therefore, &#x00A7; 3207 is subject to strict scrutiny review. In response, HHS cites <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. 749 (1975), for the proposition that the statute need only be reviewed for a rational basis. Ms. Delong correctly points out that because <span class="Italic">Salfi</span> is a social welfare classification" case it is not directly on point with her appeal. However, that does not mean that we can ignore the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Salfi</span> altogether, particularly where that decision "explain[s]...at some length" the Court's prior decisions on the constitutionality of irrebuttable presumptions. <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. at 768. <span class="Italic">Salfi</span> indicates that statutes creating conclusive presumptions are judged under the same due process standards as other statutes. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 770-72. Where the statute at issue does not abridge a fundamental right or discriminate against a suspect class, it is upheld if it "bear[s]...[a] rational relation to a legitimate legislative goal" and is free from invidious discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 772.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Delong has not cited, and we could not uncover, any case where the Supreme Court has suggested that federal employment is a fundamental right, the abridgment of which must withstand strict scrutiny under the Due Process Clause. The closest case cited by Ms. Delong is <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur</span>, 414 U.S. 632 (1974), where the Court struck down a state law that required pregnant public school teachers to take unpaid leave beginning five months before their due dates. The Court reviewed the statute under a more critical lens than the rational basis test, requiring the state to "justify the particular procedures [it had] adopted" and to convince the Court that the chosen procedures "do not needlessly, arbitrarily, or capriciously impinge" on the teachers' rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 640. The Court did not apply this heightened level of scrutiny because the teachers had a "fundamental" interest in their employment, however, but because "the decision whether to bear...a child" was viewed as a "basic constitutional liberty" upon which the statute infringed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 640, 647; <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. at 771 (noting that <span class="Italic">LaFleur</span> concerned the important "freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life"). Because Ms. Delong has not demonstrated that her federal employment is a fundamental right, and has not argued that the statute discriminates against her as a member of a suspect class, we review &#x00A7; 3207 under the rational basis test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Delong argues that the statute fails under the rational basis test because it is overly broad. She contends that removing employees who have been rehabilitated since committing their crimes, as she alleges she has been, does not further the legitimate purpose behind the Act of protecting Indian children from abuse. Ms. Delong asserts that, in order to pass muster under the Constitution, the statute must require HHS to conduct a meaningful hearing, based on individual circumstances, on the issue of whether an employee is fit for continued employment in a covered position. We have carefully considered Ms. Delong's arguments, but we cannot agree that the Constitution requires such a hearing in her case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The hearing required by the Due Process Clause must be meaningful and appropriate to the nature of the case." <span class="Italic">Bell v. Burson</span>, 402 U.S. 535, 541-42 (1971) (internal quotations and citations omitted). A procedural rule required to satisfy due process in one context may not be required in every case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 540. For example, in <span class="Italic">Bell</span>, the Supreme Court held that before Georgia could deprive an uninsured motorist involved in an accident of his driver's license and vehicle registration for failing to post security to cover the amount of damages claimed against him, it had to conduct a hearing to determine "whether there is a reasonable possibility" that he might be found at fault or otherwise liable for the damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 540. The Court did not reach this conclusion because an irrebuttable presumption that uninsured drivers are at fault would be unconstitutional <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but because other aspects of the statute at issue demonstrated that actual liability "played] a crucial role in the...[law]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 541. For example, Georgia would not suspend the uninsured driver's license if the injured party released him from liability or if there was an adjudication of nonliability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Relevant to Ms. Delong's appeal is the Court's statement that if "fault and liability [were] irrelevant to the statutory scheme," a hearing limited to the issues of whether the uninsured driver was involved in the accident, whether he had complied with the statute, and whether he fell under any of the exceptions to the statute "would [have been] appropriate to the nature of the case." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotation omitted). Under those circumstances, a hearing on liability would not be required. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 3207 is similar to the "no-fault" scheme distinguished in Bell in that it prohibits the employment of any person who fails to satisfy certain minimum standards of character, regardless of whether the person actually poses a threat to Indian children. <span class="Italic">Bell</span> therefore indicates that the Constitution does not require that Ms. Delong be afforded a hearing on the issue of her fitness for service in a covered position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In creating the minimum standards of character set forth in &#x00A7; 3207, Congress created a bright line rule that anyone who has been convicted of an enumerated crime may not serve in a covered position. Like all bright line rules, &#x00A7; 3207 is both overinclusive and under-inclusive, but the imprecision of the statute does not make it unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's analysis of the Social Security statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Salfi</span> is instructive on this point. The statute denied survival benefits to "widows and stepchildren who had their respective relationships to a deceased wage earner for less than nine months prior to his death." <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>, 422 U.S. at 754. The statute "was intended to prevent the use of sham marriages to secure Social Security payments." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 767. The Court noted that, when a statute does not infringe upon a constitutionally protected status or a fundamental right, the Constitution does not "ban all prophylactic [overinclusive and under-inclusive] provisions," and does not even require that "the provision filters out a substantial part of the class which caused congressional concern, or [that] it filters out more members of the class than nonmembers." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 777. Instead, the Court stated, "[t]he question is whether Congress, its concern having been reasonably aroused by the possibility of an abuse which it legitimately desired to avoid, could rationally have concluded both that a particular limitation...would protect against its occurrence, and that the expense and other difficulties of individual determination justified the inherent imprecision of a prophylactic rule." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Delong admits that the creation of minimum standards of character for those who have regular contact with Indian children is rationally related to the government's interest in protecting those children from abuse. Congress could rationally have concluded that the minimum standards of character in &#x00A7; 3207 would reduce the incidence of abuse of Indian children at the hands of federal employees. Moreover, given the difficulty of identifying employees who pose a threat to Indian children, the choice of a blanket rule is justified in this case. <span class="Italic">Cf. Vlandis v. Kline</span>, 412 U.S. 441, 452 (1973) (striking a statute that denied students the resident rate for state university tuition and fees by operation of an irrebuttable presumption where the state had "reasonable alternative means of making the crucial [resident or nonresident] determination"); <span class="Italic">LaFleur</span>, 414 U.S. at 800 n.14 (noting that, instead of imposing an irrebuttable presumption that women are physically unfit to work as teachers after their fifth month of pregnancy, the school boards "could require the pregnant teacher to submit to a medical examination by a school board physician, or simply require each teacher to submit a current certification from her obstetrician as to her ability to continue work"); <span class="Italic">but see Stanley v. Illinois</span>, 405 U.S. 645, 652 (1972) (stating that a father's "interest in retaining custody of his children is cognizable and substantial" and requiring a hearing on the issue of a father's parental fitness before his children can be removed from his custody).</p>
