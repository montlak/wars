<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-163"><span class="space">2.</span> Refund</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8342 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an employee or Member who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)(A)&#x2003;is separated from the service for at least thirty-one consecutive days; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;is transferred to a position in which he is not subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, and remains in such a position for at least thirty-one consecutive days;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;files an application with the Office of Personnel Management for payment of the lump-sum credit;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, at the time he files the application; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;will not become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Except as provided in section 8343a or 8334(d)(2) of this title, the receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the employee or Member voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the employee or Member is reemployed in the service subject to this subchapter....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 831.2002 (2022) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Eligibility for lump-sum payment upon filing an Application for Refund of Retirement Deductions (SF 2802)</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except as provided in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.2007 through 2009 or in section 3716 of title 31, United States Code, on administrative offset for government claims, a former employee or Member who has been separated from a covered position for at least 31 days at the time of filing an application for refund and who is ineligible for an annuity commencing within 31 days after the date of filing an application for refund is eligible for a refund for the total lump-sum credit to his or her credit in the Retirement Fund.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">FERS refunds were addressed in <span class="Italic">Conway v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 405, 409 (1993) (under 5 USC 8424, the refund is for all the employee's contributions and interest, rather than any part that the employee decides to withdraw).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Limitations on redeposits and the preclusion of a partial withdrawal of retirement deposits were described in the CSRS appeal of <span class="Italic">Delarosa v. OPM</span>, 607 Fed. Appx. 979, 980-81 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An <span class="Italic">employee</span> who received a refund of retirement deductions is allowed to redeposit that amount, with interest. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1). The statute explicitly limits this right of redeposit to employees, and Mr. Delarosa does not qualify as an employee. The relevant regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a), provides alternate definitions for "employee" as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(d)(1). Because Mr. Delarosa does not meet either regulatory definition, we agree with the Board that he is not eligible to redeposit his retirement deductions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the regulation provides that someone who is "currently employed in a position subject to the civil service retirement law" is an <span class="Italic">employee</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a)(1) (2015). There is no dispute that Mr. Delarosa is not currently employed in such a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, a former employee may also be an <span class="Italic">employee</span> eligible to make a redeposit, but only if he or she "retains civil service retirement annuity rights." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a)(2). Though Mr. Delarosa is a former employee, he does not retain annuity rights and therefore does not satisfy this second definition of "employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Delarosa's annuity rights were voided when he received the refund payment for his retirement deductions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342. The statute provides that he was entitled to receive a payment of lump-sum credit (the refund of his retirement deductions). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But that also entails cancelling his annuity rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> And when Mr. Delarosa requested his retirement deductions, he was informed that he would forfeit annuity rights upon payment of the refund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Delarosa argues that he did not void his annuity rights, and therefore is an eligible former employee, because there is still $46.11 left in his retirement account. But that $46.11 balance does not save his annuity rights. OPM has reasonably interpreted the lump-sum credit statute to mean that, when an employee requests a refund "the employee is to be paid all of his retirement contributions, as well as all the interest payable with respect to those contributions, for his entire period of service." <span class="Italic">Conway v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 405, 409 (1993). Employees are not entitled to withdrawal a fraction of their retirement account, and preserve annuity rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The request for a lump-sum credit is a request for a full refund of retirement deductions, and on receipt of payment annuity rights are extinguished. Because an employee cannot request a partial refund and retain annuity rights, it reasonably follows that--where an employee requests a full refund, but a balance remains leftover in his or her retirement account--that employee similarly has not preserved annuity rights.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that there is no provision for waiver of the requirement described above. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The legal basis for a refund of retirement contributions paid to an employee pursuant to a separation is removed when the separation is subsequently disallowed and canceled by restoring the employee to duty retroactively so that there was no break in service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342; <span class="Italic">Dailey v.

Department of Agriculture</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 686, 697 (1991). Thus, although the refund in this case did not result in an overpayment when it was received in 1981, it nonetheless became a debt owed to the retirement fund when the appellant was reinstated with no break in service of at least thirty-one consecutive days. <span class="Italic">See Corman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 535, 537-38 (1988) (an overpayment occurs when an appellant is not eligible to receive the payment that was made); <span class="Italic">Lee v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the refund received by the appellant became erroneous once the appellant was reinstated with back pay effective with the date of his separation.

Moreover, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that, under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i), it is the legal obligation of not only the agency, but also the employee, to repay a lump-sum refund erroneously withdrawn from the CSRS fund. <span class="Italic">See Tanaka v. Department of the Navy</span>, 788 F.2d 1552, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4382"></span>We conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the board's determination that the doctrine of laches barred Haq's claim for a deferred retirement annuity. As the board correctly determined, Haq's delay in seeking information about the refund of her retirement contributions was both unreasonable and inexcusable. She requested a refund of her retirement contributions on July 17, 2004, and this refund was authorized on November 16, 2004, yet she waited nearly sixteen years to raise the claim that she had never received the refund in question. Although Haq now asserts that neither she nor her designated beneficiary, the Children's Fund, received the refund payment, she fails to provide any reasonable explanation as to why she did not inquire about the status of her refund until she applied for a deferred annuity on June 25, 2020.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the board correctly noted, while Haq could not have obtained "a deferred annuity prior to reaching the minimum retirement age," this did not mean that she was precluded from contacting OPM "to determine whether her refund was processed" in a timely fashion. Although Haq asserts on appeal that she was out of the country from August 2004 to April 2009, she fails to explain how being out of the country prevented her from making any inquiries about the status of her refund. Furthermore, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Haq's delay while she was out of the country was excusable, she offers no persuasive justification for waiting eleven years after her return to the United States before raising the claim that she had never received the refund. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Wanlass v. Gen. Elec. Co</span>., 148 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (explaining that a party seeking to avoid the laches bar must be diligent and make such inquiries as the facts and circumstances reasonably warrant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM suffered material defense prejudice, moreover, as a result of Haq's delay in inquiring about her allegedly missing refund payment. As discussed previously, retirement fund refund payments are issued by the Department of the Treasury and it maintains records of such payments for only seven years. Accordingly, when Haq filed her claim in 2020, OPM was unable to access the documentation which would presumably have shown whether she or the Children's Fund had deposited the refund check she had requested. OPM, therefore, was materially prejudiced in its ability to defend against Haq's claim. The prejudice to OPM was compounded by the fact that Haq failed to provide the board with any of her own tax or banking records from 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the length of Haq's delay in seeking her allegedly missing refund payment was unreasonable and this delay materially impeded OPM's ability to mount a defense against her claim, the board had ample support for its conclusion that the doctrine of laches barred her request for a deferred retirement annuity. We have considered Haq's remaining arguments but do not find them persuasive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A refund that is determined to be illegal cannot preclude a determination that an appellant is entitled to a disability annuity. <span class="Italic">Pagum v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant's receipt of a refund of his CSRS contributions does not necessarily preclude his receipt of a retirement annuity. The Federal Circuit has implicitly found that an individual may avoid the rule that receipt of a refund of retirement contributions voids annuity rights if the individual was mentally incompetent at the time he applied for and received the refund. <span class="Italic">See Yarbrough v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 770 F.2d 1056, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Further, OPM and the Board have reasoned that the erroneous payment of a lump-sum refund cannot void an appellant's entitlement to an annuity to which the appellant is otherwise entitled. <span class="Italic">See Pagum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 599, 602-03 (1995); <span class="Italic">Crowder v.

If the appellant can establish that he was entitled to a retirement annuity at the time of his separation from service, he would not have been lawfully entitled to receive a lump-sum payment of his retirement contributions and the erroneous refund would not preclude him from receiving an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a)(1)(B)(4) (in order to be entitled to receive a lump-sum refund of retirement contributions, the employee cannot become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application). Additionally, the appellant was restored to his former position following his removal from his first term of federal service from March 7, 1977, to May 25, 1995. Upon the appellant's restoration to his position, effective May 26, 1995, the appellant lost his entitlement to a lump-sum distribution of his CSRS contributions for his first term of service, and his employing agency should have deducted that $23,718.47 lump-sum refund from his back pay pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2)(ii). Thus, the erroneous payment of the first lump-sum refund would not preclude the appellant's receipt of an annuity based on that period of service. <span class="Italic">See Pagum,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 602-03; <span class="Italic">Crowder,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. at 295.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the Board correctly determined that Morrison did not qualify for any of the exceptions that would allow an applicant to receive a refund but still qualify for a deferred annuity. An applicant who receives a refund of retirement contributions may still be eligible to receive a deferred annuity if the applicant: (1) was mentally incompetent at the time they applied for and received a refund; (2) erroneously received the lump sum payment; or (3) was not entitled to receive the refund at the time it was paid. <span class="Italic">Wadley v.

Morrison conceded to the Board that she was not mentally incompetent at the time she applied for the refund. Morrison also presented no evidence to show either that the payment that she received was erroneous or that she was not entitled to receive the refund. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Morrison has not pointed to any additional evidence or facts that the Board overlooked in coming to these conclusions. Her alleged misunderstanding of OPM's clear notice that receipt of her contributions would eliminate any right to a deferred annuity does not provide her with an exemption from the law.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Danganan v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 265, 268-69 (1992), addressed documentation requirements to demonstrate payments of lump sums and to avoid annuity obligations beyond the lump sum refund based on lack of adequate information to the appellant about the consequences of an election to take a lump sum withdrawal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we discussed above, the administrative judge found that the agency had failed to prove that the appellant had applied for such a refund or that he accepted such refund "with full knowledge that it would deprive him of his right to an annuity." The record compiled below, however, was sufficient to show that the appellant applied for a refund at the time of his separation, especially in view of his failure to dispute OPM's statement in its reconsideration decision that he had received a refund. Although his application for a refund (SF-2802) was not submitted into the record below, the appellant stated in his retirement application (OPM Form 1496) that he had previously applied for a refund of his contributions and his retirement application indicates that a copy of his refund application was attached. Since the appellant certified his statements made in his retirement application to be true under penalty of law, we find that they must be deemed persuasive evidence of the facts stated therein. <span class="Italic">See Borninkhof v. Department of Justice,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 83-87 (1981) (assessment of the probative value of hearsay evidence necessarily depends on the circumstances of each case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the individual retirement record (CSC Form 2806) (IRR) further supports the conclusion that the appellant applied for and received a refund. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The IRR indicates a total payment amount of $675.34, consisting of it $626.75 in contributions and $49.09 in interest, from which $14.73 was deducted, thereby amounting to a payment of $660.61, as alleged by OPM. Since the IRR was compiled in the normal course of business, we find that it is persuasive evidence that the payment amount was prepared in response to a refund application and gives rise to an inference that a refund was made accordingly. <span class="Italic">See Rint v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 69, 72 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that there was no evidence submitted before the record closed below that the appellant was aware that he would forfeit any retirement benefits if he withdrew his retirement contributions. When an applicant for an annuity does not meet the requisite statutory requirements, however, OPM cannot be required to pay the annuity. <span class="Italic">See Bono v.

Where the only definitive proof that the appellant actually received a refund i.e., the canceled Treasury check, is no longer available because of the appellant's delay in pursuing his claim, the Board has found that OPM's ability to defend the appeal has been impaired and that OPM would be unduly prejudiced if the Board required it to produce definitive proof of the appellant's actual receipt of the check. <span class="Italic">See Sosa</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 686.</p>

Office of Personnel Management,</span> 770 F.2d 1056, 1060-61 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the issue of whether an appellant has received a refund of her retirement contributions, the Board will consider any office records kept by OPM showing that OPM previously had authorized a refund and will accord those records substantial weight to the extent that they give rise to an inference that the appellant actually received a refund. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Danganan v.

Where definitive proof that the appellant actually received a refund no longer is available because of the appellant's delay in pursuing her claim, the Board has found that OPM's ability to defend the appeal has been impaired and that OPM would be unduly prejudiced if the Board required it to produce definitive proof of the appellant's actual receipt of the check. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 686.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her decision, citing the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), the administrative judge found that the appellant's testimony that she did not receive the refund of her retirement contributions was not credible. She found that both refund applications contained the appellant's correct personal information and signatures that appeared similar to her signature on other documents in the record. She also found that, contrary to the appellant's testimony, there was no probative evidence of "tampering" or "fraud" regarding the second refund application. The administrative judge also stated that there was no evidence to support the appellant's conclusory and speculative statements regarding the perpetration of possible fraud, either by the father of her children, the U.S. Postal Service managers, or by the "federal government" at large. The administrative judge therefore concluded that the appellant was not entitled to a deferred annuity because she had received a refund of her CSRS contributions and that she was not otherwise entitled to a deferred annuity or to make a redeposit for her prior federal service because she was not a federal government employee and had no other qualifying service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed OPM's records, including its refund authorization, the appellant's IRR, and its 1982 correspondence regarding the refund. Based on that review, we agree with the administrative judge that OPM's evidence gives rise to an inference that the appellant actually received the refund. <span class="Italic">See Danganan</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 269.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge's determination that the appellant's testimony was not credible. The Board will defer to the credibility determinations of an administrative judge when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, upon the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing because the administrative judge is in the best position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and determine which witnesses were testifying credibly. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1300-01 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The administrative judge found that the appellant's testimony was not credible in light of its inconsistencies with other evidence of record and the inherent improbability of the events occurring in the way the appellant contended. Because the administrative judge's credibility findings are based on proper considerations, supported by the record, and implicitly based on her observations, we will defer to them on review. <span class="Italic">See Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1300-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Board has held that it may be appropriate to hold OPM responsible for its own inability to defend the appeal where the appellant put OPM on notice shortly after her refund application that she had not received her refund. <span class="Italic">Manoharan</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 18. However, in this case, the appellant applied for her refund in 1979 and 1980, and did not assert to OPM that she did not receive her refund until 2014, when she indicated in her retirement application that she had not previously filed any application under the CSRS. We therefore find that OPM should not be held responsible for its inability to prove that the appellant received the refund. <span class="Italic">See Manoharan</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 159, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has held that, although OPM's records typically will outweigh an appellant's uncorroborated testimony that she never actually received a refund, an appellant's credible explanation of events, supported by documentary evidence, may be sufficient to overcome OPM's evidence that it previously refunded the appellant's retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12-15. However, as previously discussed, we defer to the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's testimony was not credible; we also find that her testimony is not supported by documentary evidence. We therefore find that the appellant's testimony is insufficient to overcome OPM's evidence that she received a refund of her retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">See Sosa</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 686.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the evidence as a whole does not establish that the appellant failed to receive the refund of her retirement contributions. We therefore also agree that, because the appellant withdrew her retirement deductions, was not presently employed in the federal government, and did not have any other qualifying service, she was not entitled to make a deposit or to receive a deferred annuity. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a)); <span class="Italic">see Morales v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 5, 8-9 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A demonstration by OPM that a refund was authorized establishes a presumption that a payment was made--at least the presumption prevails over a lack of reliable contrary evidence from the appellant, <span class="Italic">Landvogt v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant underlying facts of this case are not in dispute. Ms. Landvogt applied in 1983 for a refund of her retirement contributions. OPM authorized the payment of the requested refund. Under these circumstances, there is a presumption that the payment of the refund was made. <span class="Italic">See Bernklau v. Principi</span>, 291 F.3d 795, 801 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("The 'presumption of regularity' supports official acts of public officers. In the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the doctrine presumes that public officers have properly discharged their official duties." (citing <span class="Italic">Butler v. Principi</span>, 244 F.3d 1337, 1340 Fed. Cir. 2001))). Ms. Landvogt has not asserted that OPM used an incorrect address to send her refund in 1983; nor has she offered any information to undermine the presumption of regularity, beyond her unsworn and uncorroborated statement that she did not receive the refund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Ms. Landvogt failed to carry her burden to prove non-receipt of the authorized refund of $14,655.75. Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the refund was received....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board had no reason to upset OPM's evidence of payment of a refund in <span class="Italic">Omrani v. OPM</span>, CH-0831-13-0275-I-1 (NP 12/31/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that normal office records, compiled in the ordinary course of business, are admissible and are entitled to substantial weight. <span class="Italic">Rint v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 69, 72 (1991). As detailed above, OPM's routine records establish application for a refund and the issuance of a refund check on June 26, 1979, to the appellant in the amount of $3,164.47. The office records that OPM submitted below meet the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Rint</span> and are thus admissible and entitled to substantial weight. <span class="Italic">See Sosa v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 683, 685-86 (1997). In addition, there is no evidence showing that the check was not issued to the appellant. Nor has the appellant introduced any probative evidence showing nonreceipt of his retirement contributions for his 9 years 7 months of service ending April 28, 1979. Furthermore, while the appellant had LTC Mills contact OPM in October 1984 to initially inquire about the refund of his retirement deductions, and again in January 1985 to follow up on OPM's statement that a refund check had been issued to him in 1979, the appellant made no personal effort to contact OPM until he filed his application for a <span id="Page_4384"></span>deferred retirement in 2013, some 28 years later. Where there has been a substantial delay of years before raising a claim, and the only definitive record of actual payment, the cancelled check, is not available, we have consistently found that OPM's ability to defend has been impaired. <span class="Italic">Sosa</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 686; <span class="Italic">Deleon v.

Weighing OPM's office records and documentary evidence against the appellant's unsupported assertions, we conclude that the appellant has failed to overcome the evidence to the contrary and prove by preponderant evidence that he did not receive a retirement of his contributions in 1979.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Manoharan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that he is entitled to the retirement refund. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] ; <span class="Italic">Sosa v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. 683, 685 (1997). Thus, in a case such as this, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that he did not receive a refund of his retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">Sosa,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 686; <span class="Italic">Aquino v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 265, 268 (1991); <span class="Italic">Deleon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 369, 373 (1991); <span class="Italic">Rint v.

The issues discussed below should be resolved before the administrative judge rules on whether the appellant has proven by preponderant evidence that he did not receive a refund of his retirement contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, as noted above, the refund application indicated that "payment cannot be authorized if above address is altered." There is no dispute that the name of the appellant's employer, originally typed in the address box on the application, was altered by handwritten changes. Although it appears that OPM nevertheless authorized payment of the refund, and that a check was prepared on or about January 30, 1985, it is conceivable that the alteration of the address was eventually discovered and that the payment authorization was rescinded. While we recognize that the handwritten changes do not appear to have changed the location to which the refund would be mailed, and we can speculate that this would not have affected the initial authorization, there is no evidence in the record on this potentially dispositive issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even assuming that the refund authorization had not been rescinded and that the check had been mailed to the appellant's former employing agency, there is no indication as to whether that agency knew of the appellant's new address in India and forwarded the check to him after May 6, 1985. The appellant asserted below, "Though I have been go[ing] to this organization as a visitor or a consultant for a few weeks once in a year or two nobody ever told me either about this refund order or a check lying with them, may be [sic] because of the frequent change of officers handling this work." Further, there is no indication in the existing record that OPM ever responded to the appellant's May 6, 1985 letter, took any action to determine whether the issued check had been negotiated, or stopped payment on the check and issued a new check to the appellant in India. We note that, contrary to the implication in a letter OPM sent to the appellant on June 23, 2005, which indicated that "[he] needed to contact [OPM's] office before October 1, 1990 in order to have [his] refund check reissued," the appellant did contact OPM before October 1, 1990, asserting in his May 6, 1985 letter that he had not received the check.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the record reflects that the appellant waited until July 2003, to apply for a second time for a refund of his retirement contributions, the appellant explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As to the question why I did not raise this question after my letter of May 6, 1985 until 2003, I can only say from June 2006 [sic] I had personally trying times leading finally to a heart attack during a brief visit to the US for which I underwent a bypass surgery in Jan.-Feb. 1987 in Johns Hopkins Hospital.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant wrote, "In this melee of things following the recuperative period, I must have completely forgotten about it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant also wrote that he was under the impression that "this fund will reach [him] only after [he] reach[ed] the age of 65 or so, like in India," and that "[he] was under the wrong impression that the refund will come back to [him] with interest (or whatever) at a much later time according to [OPM's] superannuation procedures," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 37. The appellant noted that "[a]pproaching the above office [NIA] where [he] worked did not yield any result." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> These assertions, if repeated at a hearing under oath, should be assessed by the AJ under the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the cases relied upon by the AJ may be distinguishable from this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Rint,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. at 71, the appellant applied for a refund of retirement deductions in April 1951, OPM authorized payment of the refund in June 1951, and a voucher for payment was issued in July 1951. Although the appellant made an unsworn, uncorroborated denial that he received the refund, OPM asserted that: (1) The voucher authorized the issuance of a Department of the Treasury (Treasury) check; (2) there was no record evidence indicating that the check was not issued by the Treasury; (3) there was no notification from the Treasury that the check was not issued or that the check was returned as undeliverable; and (4) the Treasury does not retain copies of canceled checks for more than ten years. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 71-72. The Board held that, "[u]nder the circumstances of this case, where there is a delay of over 37 years in raising a claim, and the only definitive record of actual payment, the canceled Treasury check, is not available, we find that OPM's ability to defend has been impaired." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 72. The Board found that OPM would be unduly prejudiced if the Board required it to produce definitive proof of the appellant's actual receipt of the check, and concluded that the appellant failed to overcome the evidence to the contrary and prove that he did not receive a refund of his retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Deleon,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. at 372, the appellant applied for a refund of his retirement deductions on December 27, 1966, OPM authorized payment on February 6, 1967, and the appellant's sole evidence in the case was his unsworn, uncorroborated denial that he received the refund. The Board, relying on <span class="Italic">Rint,</span> held that the appellant did not introduce any probative evidence showing nonreceipt and that, "where there is a delay of 23 years in raising a claim, and the only definitive record of actual payment, the canceled Treasury check, is not available, we find that OPM's ability to defend has been impaired." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 372-73. The Board concluded that the appellant did not prove by preponderant evidence that he did not receive a refund of his retirement contributions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 373. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Sosa,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 685, the appellant applied for a refund in February 1969, OPM authorized payment later that month, and the check was negotiated. Although the appellant testified at the hearing that he did not receive the check, the Board noted that the appellant's testimony was uncorroborated by any other evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 685-86. Relying on<span class="Italic"> Rint</span> and <span class="Italic">Deleon,</span> the Board found that the appellant did not establish by preponderant evidence that he did not receive the refund, noting that his twenty-five year delay in raising a claim had impaired OPM's ability to defend its position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 686.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication in the above cases that, as in this case, the address on the refund application had been altered, thus creating the possibility that the refund had not ultimately been authorized or sent. More important, the appellants in the above cases waited thirty-two, twenty-three, and twenty-five years before bringing their alleged nonreceipt of the refunds to OPM's attention. Here, by contrast, the appellant informed OPM less than four months after the apparent mailing of the refund check that he had not received the check. Thus, the appellant appears to have placed OPM on notice that there was a question as to his receipt of the refund within a period of time such that OPM could have ascertained whether any mailed check had been negotiated, or canceled any issued check and issued a new check that could have been mailed to the appellant in India. As set forth above, there is no indication in the existing record that OPM took such action or even sent a response to the appellant in India.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that he would have requested a lump sum payment rather than applying for and receiving a disability retirement annuity if he had been correctly informed by his agency as to the likely amount of the monthly retirement benefit, the AJ errs by determining whether OPM should have permitted a lump sum withdrawal. The correct process is to redocket the case as an involuntary retirement appeal against the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baier v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 210, 212-13 (1990). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-052.html#sec6-53">Involuntary Retirement</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to obtain a lump sum refund of retirement contributions is limited by the OPM's need to notify the spouse or former spouse of the application for the refund, as suggested in <span class="Italic">Wright v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 217, 220-21 &#x00B6; 9, 2009 MSPB 69 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its cross-PFR, OPM cites 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(b)(1)(A) and <span class="Italic">Muwwakkil v.

The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8424(b)(1)(A) only allows OPM to pay a lump-sum credit, as described in subsection (a), "if the spouse, if any, and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member's application."

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case, which comes to us from a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant, raises an important question regarding the duty of OPM under the statutes requiring former-spouse notification. On reconsideration of its initial decision, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) denied Melanie L. Muwwakkil's (Muwwakkil) application for benefits, based on the employment of her former spouse, James A. Lee (Lee), under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA). The Merit Systems Protection Board (Board), Dkt. No. DC0831930263-I-1, affirmed the decision of OPM. She appealed. We <span class="Italic">vacate</span> and <span class="Italic">remand.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Muwwakkil was married to Lee; they had two sons, now teenagers. Muwwakkil and Lee were divorced on December 2, 1988. The divorce decree provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that (i) Muwwakkil was granted custody of the minor children, Jelani A. Lee and Jawara A. Lee; (ii) Lee was to contribute $400 per month child support; and (iii) there were no property rights to be adjudicated. At the time, Lee had been an employee of the government of the District of Columbia for almost twenty years, and a participant in the federal Civil Service Retirement System. In August of 1991, Lee resigned from his job with the District, and applied for a lump-sum payment of the retirement contributions that had been withheld from his salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the CSRS form "Application for Refund of Retirement Deductions" which Lee completed there were two questions dealing with marital status. Question 14 asked Lee whether he was then married. In response, Lee stated that he was not, which was correct. Question 15 on the form then asked Lee whether he had been divorced "on or after May 7, 1985." Lee responded in the negative, which was not correct. If Lee had answered Question 15 correctly, the form then required him to identify Muwwakkil as a living former spouse from whom he was divorced. On October 11, 1991, OPM approved Lee's application for lump-sum payment, and made the requested payment to Lee in the amount of about $25,000. No notification was given to Muwwakkil beforehand, as required by statute.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Sec. 2(5)(B) of the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(i)(1) (1988)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member's application....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 8, 1992, Lee died. Upon learning of Lee's death, Muwwakkil applied to OPM for death benefits on behalf of herself and her two children based on Lee's period of employment with the District of Columbia. On October 27, 1992, OPM sent Muwwakkil a form letter noting that "All retirement deductions were refunded to the deceased. No benefits are payable." A penned marginal note said, "All deductions were refunded on 10-11-91."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated November 9, 1992, Muwwakkil asked OPM to reconsider its decision to the extent it related to her application on behalf of her children, setting out in some detail the history of the case. On January 15, 1993, OPM by letter affirmed the initial decision. In its letter, OPM informed Muwwakkil that no <span class="Italic">annuity</span> benefits were payable to her children because they did not meet the eligibility requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2) (1988). That statute provides, in pertinent part, that if</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee...dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, or an employee...dies after retiring under this subchapter, and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee..., that surviving child is entitled to an annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM explained that no such benefits were payable to her children because at the time of his death James Lee was not an "employee" and, having resigned rather than having retired from employment with the D.C. government, Lee did not die after retiring. OPM pointed out that annuity benefits would only be payable to his children "if Mr. Lee had continued his employment to the date of death, or if he was separated for Civil Service retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the failure to give the required statutory notice, OPM explained that, although Lee "incorrectly stated on his Application for Refund of Retirement Deductions that he had not been divorced, this would not apparently have effected [sic] payment of the refund." OPM then added, "his Civil Service retirement contributions were refunded to him prior to his death, so there is no lump-sum amount payable to the children." With regard to Muwwakkil herself, OPM noted that the divorce decree did not provide her with any portion of Lee's retirement contributions--"the decree states that there are no property rights to be adjudicated."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Muwwakkil then appealed to the Board. On her appeal form, Muwwakkil stated that she was appealing OPM's "[d]enial of survival benefits for the sons of James A. Lee." Before the Board, Muwwakkil argued that she was entitled to the relief which she sought because she had not been notified of Lee's application for refund of his retirement deductions. She wrote,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office of Personnel Management did not properly check the records of Mr. Lee before refunding him his retirement. Mr. Lee falsified the application by stating that he had never been married. Mr. Lee's reluctance to state the truth should have been challenged by OPM and a discussion held with Mr. Lee prior to the release of his retirement funds....&#8197;What is the purpose of requiring the applicant to answer the question "Have you ever been married?" if the applicant does not have to report the truth and if the question is irrelevant to applicants [sic] applying for retirement refund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Addressing OPM's observation that the divorce decree failed to state that she was to receive any portion of his retirement contributions, Muwwakkil wrote,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At the time of filing for my divorce I received advice from staff and employees of the Family Division-Domestic Relations Branch of DC Superior Court. I was not informed at the time that an attachment of [retirement funds] could be made. With knowledge of Mr. Lee's payment history I definitely would have included such a clause in the divorce decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the decision that gave rise to this appeal, the Board affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision. In so doing, the Board agreed with OPM that receipt of retirement deductions voids all rights to an annuity based on the service upon which the refund is based. In addition because the deceased's retirement deductions were refunded to him, they were not available as a lump-sum credit for payment to his surviving children.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board acknowledged that Muwwakkil should have been notified prior to the refund of the retirement contributions made by Lee, as required by statute, but "the responsibility for making that notification, in the first instance, was her former husband's," citing OPM regulation &#x00A7; 831.2007(b)(2), (c). The Board further considered that she had failed to prove that she or her children were entitled to any statutory or regulatory relief as a result of not being notified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Muwwakkil argues that the disbursement to her former husband, James Lee, was improper because she was not provided with prior notice as required by &#x00A7; 2(5)(B) of the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984 (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j) (1988)), and thus the Board erred. She claims that OPM is "responsible to provide relief to Mr. Lee's surviving dependents," and that we should award "at least half of Mr. Lee's retirement benefits to his dependent children...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of the statute requires that notice be given to a former spouse prior to disbursement of a lump-sum payment of the retirement contributions of the other:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(j)(1)&#x2003;Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member's application....&#8197;(Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub. L. No. 98-615, &#x00A7; 2(5)(B), 98 Stat. 3201, 3202 (1984). When statutory interpretation is at issue, the plain and unambiguous meaning of a statute prevails. <span class="Italic">See VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co.,</span> 917 F.2d 1574, 1579, 16 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board acknowledged that Muwwakkil was correct in claiming that, by statute and regulation, she should have been notified prior to the refund of the retirement deductions to Lee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2007 (1993). The Board also determined, however, that responsibility for making that notification was, in the first instance, her former husband's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Spouse Equity Act provides, in pertinent part, that "[n]otification of a spouse or former spouse shall be made in accordance with such requirements as [OPM] by regulation prescribes." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(2) (1988). OPM has prescribed notification requirements in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2007(b)(2), (c) (1993). Pursuant to that regulation, a person who is applying for the refund of retirement deductions has the obligation of certifying whether he or she has a current or former spouse who is subject to the notification requirement, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2007(b)(2). Such a person also has the obligation of presenting proof of notification to any current or former spouse in the form of a witnessed statement by the current or former spouse that he or she has been informed of the application for a refund and of the consequences of the refund on the current or former spouse's entitlement to an annuity, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2007(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon OPM's regulation, the Board apparently concluded that, once James Lee had answered Questions 14 and 15 on the refund application <span id="Page_4386"></span>form in the negative, OPM had no obligation to inquire further in the matter in order to assure compliance with the notification requirement of the statute. Put another way, the Board apparently concluded that OPM was not required to look behind Lee's negative answers in the application form in order to determine whether Lee had a current or former spouse. That conclusion was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM did not discharge its responsibilities with respect to the notification requirement of the Spouse Equity Act. The statute plainly gives OPM authority to prescribe the <span class="Italic">manner</span> in which notice is to be given, but not the authority to <span class="Italic">dispense</span> with that requirement. The OPM regulation which requires an applicant to certify whether he or she has a current or former spouse who is subject to the notification requirement is a reasonable and appropriate way for OPM to initiate the inquiry which must be undertaken in connection with that requirement. And it is reasonable to require, when an applicant acknowledges there is such a spouse, that the applicant notify that person of the intended withdrawal and its consequences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, when, as here, an applicant for a refund gives negative answers to questions asking whether the applicant has a current or former spouse who is subject to the statutory notification requirement, OPM cannot simply rest there. At a minimum, OPM has a duty to verify those answers by a check of the appropriate records, in this case Lee's personnel file at the District of Columbia. Such a check would have revealed that, as of the date of Lee's application, there were several outstanding orders attaching Lee's salary for the purpose of satisfying delinquent child support payments to Muwwakkil. Thus, such a check would have revealed that his answer to Question 15 on the refund application form was incomplete, and probably untruthful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for us to hold that OPM properly discharged its duties under the Spouse Equity Act in this case, we would have to conclude that Congress intended to allow the financial rights of one former spouse to be subject to the whim and caprice of the other, an inconceivable result given the acrimonious relationship that often exists between former spouses, and the economic motivation the one might have to misrepresent the existence and identity of the other. Such a holding also would eviscerate the very purpose of the statute--to protect former spouses of federal employees from unwittingly being denied support to which by law they may be entitled. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 98-1054, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 10, 12, 13 (1984), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5540, 5540, 5542, 5543.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government on appeal argues that Muwwakkil "asks the Court to create protection and relief for her because the regulations do not do so." It may well be that the regulations do not do so, but it is clear that the statute does. When an agency's interpretation of a statute it is entrusted to administer is contrary to the intent of Congress, as divined from the statute and its legislative history, we owe it no deference. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 845 (1984) <span class="Italic">(</span>quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Shimer,</span> 367 U.S. 374, 382-83 (1961)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps the Board was concerned with the burden that compliance with the notice requirement would place on OPM. First, that is a matter that Congress decided when it wrote the statute. Second, however, we do not believe that is a serious concern under the circumstances of this case. A simple cross-check between Lee's application and his agency personnel file would have uncovered the existence and identity of Muwwakkil. We may assume that some number of employees will wish to withdraw their contributions rather than take a retirement annuity, but even so it is not an undue burden to require OPM to check an employee's personnel file to verify the accuracy of negative answers to Questions 14 and 15 on the refund application form before allowing the employee to withdraw his or her retirement contributions. It is difficult to imagine how the statute could be honored with less. Moreover, while there could be cases in which further inquiry would be required, we expect--without deciding the issue--that such a record check will typically serve to discharge OPM's responsibilities under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having held that OPM failed to discharge its responsibilities under the Spouse Equity Act, and that the Board erred in concluding otherwise, we are confronted with the question whether the failure of OPM to provide notice to Muwwakkil was harmful. On the record before us we are unable to answer that question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As already discussed, the Spouse Equity Act provides that retirement contributions may be refunded only if any former spouse is notified of the refund application. The statute also provides that any refund which is made</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">shall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or any court order or court approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree if--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;the decree, order, or agreement expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit involved; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title or to any portion of an annuity under section 8345(j) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1)(B). In pertinent part, section 8341(h) provides for a survivor annuity "to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce...or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1). For its part, section 8345 provides that an annuity payment, which otherwise would be paid to an employee based upon his or her government service, "shall be paid (in whole or in part)...to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any court decree of divorce...or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1). From this, we conclude that a former spouse, who has received notification of an application for a refund, must rely upon the relevant divorce decree or court order issued pursuant to that decree to bar payment of the refund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Muwwakkil's divorce decree did not give her either any survivor annuity rights or any rights to all or any portion of any annuity payments that would have been made to her former husband. Nor did it give her the right to receive any portion of Lee's retirement contributions upon his application for a lump-sum refund of such. As noted above, however, before the Board, Muwwakkil stated that, at the time of her divorce, she had not been aware "that an attachment of [retirement funds] could be made." She also stated that, "[w]ith knowledge of Mr. Lee's payment history I definitely would have included such a clause in the divorce decree." Assuming that Muwwakkil had been given timely notice of the proposed refund in 1991, it is not known whether at that time she would have sought, and could have obtained, a modification of the decree that would have given her rights with respect to Lee's retirement contributions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This question is not before us at this time, however. Rather, it is for the Board in the first instance to determine whether Muwwakkil was prejudiced by not being notified of the pending refund to Lee. Such a determination necessarily will involve an inquiry into whether, from the standpoint of the facts and law as they existed in 1991, Muwwakkil would have sought a modification of the divorce decree and if she had, whether such a modification could have been obtained under District of Columbia law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, as seen above, before OPM and the Board Muwwakkil also asserted a claim on behalf of her children. On remand, in determining whether the failure to give Muwwakkil the statutory notification was harmful, the Board also should take this fact into account. Specifically, the Board should ascertain whether in 1991 Muwwakkil had standing to assert a claim on behalf of her children and if so whether such a claim would have had merit at that time. In the event the Board determines that Muwwakkil was in fact prejudiced, then the Board also should determine in the first instance what, if any, relief is available to Muwwakkil.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yarbrough v. OPM</span>, 770 F.2d 1056, 1060-61 (Fed. Cir. 1985), touched briefly, but without much guidance, on an assertion that an employee's decision to take a refund of retirement funds was negated by the employee's mental state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record contains substantial evidence to support the underlying findings of the board. Although it was agreed that Mrs. Yarbrough was "distraught and alcoholic at the time," the board considered for example the overall tenor of her January 6, 1969 letter, her April 14, 1970 letter to the Civil Service Commission asking about her eligibility for retirement payments and amount she had paid into the retirement fund, the Commission's May 19, 1970 reply detailing her alternatives of an annuity or a lump-sum refund, and finally her filing of an application for refund of retirement deductions. On the face of the application the following was displayed: "If you have more than 5 years of service you may be entitled to annuity rights which will be forfeited by payment of this refund unless you are later reemployed." In addition, the board noted that, although Mrs. Yarbrough had been admitted to a state hospital in February 1969 and released later in that month or in March, no guardian was ever appointed for her and she was not formally adjudicated incompetent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conjunction with the finding of no evidence that Mrs. Yarbrough was incompetent to make her own choices, the board correctly concluded that section 8342(a) bars any right in this case to an annuity under section 8336(d). Mrs. Yarbrough received a lump-sum payment of her retirement contributions and never was reemployed in the civil service after her resignation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yarbrough</span> was cited, but not much developed, in an appeal from OPM's refusal to permit a redeposit when the appellant claimed a degree of mental infirmity when the funds were withdrawn, <span class="Italic">Swartwout v. OPM</span>, SF-0842-16-0307-I-1 (NP 11/16/2016) (relying on the initial decision):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In support of his finding, the administrative judge relied upon an implicit finding in <span class="Italic">Yarbrough v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 770 F.2d 1056 (Fed. Cir. 1985), wherein our reviewing court allowed for the possibility that mental incompetence could invalidate an employee's <span id="Page_4387"></span>decision to seek a refund of her retirement contributions, a decision that would otherwise extinguish her right to an annuity. In agreeing with the Board's finding in that case that the employee did not establish that she was incompetent, the court considered the explanation on the form she signed that receipt of a refund would forfeit her right to an annuity, the tenor of her written inquiry to the Civil Service Commission regarding her eligibility for payments and the response, and the fact that, although she had earlier been admitted to a state hospital, no guardian was ever appointed for her and she was not formally adjudicated incompetent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1060. The administrative judge in this case considered these same factors in determining that the appellant did not establish that he was incompetent at the time he resigned and sought a refund of his retirement deductions. Although the appellant questions whether these factors are appropriate for consideration, decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 12 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the administrative judge did not consider all the medical evidence he submitted. However, the administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Moreover, medical opinions that, in 1988 and 1992, the appellant suffered from serious mental illness and that his condition resulted in faulty reasoning and judgment, and that, in 1996, he experienced all normal and possible stressful life situations as overwhelming conditions that rendered him incapacitated for months, does not establish that he was incompetent in 1991 when he resigned in order to receive a refund of his retirement deductions. In sum, the appellant has not shown error by the administrative judge in finding that the appellant did not establish by preponderant evidence that his medical condition prevented him from understanding that his receipt of a refund of his retirement deductions upon his resignation would preclude him from later receiving an annuity, <span class="Italic">see Yarbrough</span>, 770 F.2d at 1060-61; that, because he requested and received such a refund, he is not entitled to an annuity,[7] <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a); and that the result is the same even if he relied on the mistaken advice of a Government official, <span class="Italic">see Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. at 416.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The Board has held that the erroneous payment of a lump-sum refund cannot void an appellant's entitlement to an annuity to which he is otherwise entitled, and that, if he can establish that he was entitled to a retirement annuity at the time of his separation from service, he would not have been lawfully entitled to receive a lump-sum payment of his retirement deductions and the erroneous refund would not preclude him from receiving an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a)(1)(B)(4); <span class="Italic">Wadley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 227, &#x00B6; 11 (2006). However, the appellant here does not suggest, nor does the evidence reflect, that he was entitled to an annuity at the time he separated from service in 1991 at age 42, given that he entered on duty in 1978 at age 29. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336.</p>
