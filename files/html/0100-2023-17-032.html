<h6 class="h6" id="sec10-33"><span class="space">(i)</span> Postal Reorganizations: 1990s</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">Postal Service reorganizations resulted in a lot of RIF litigation, and some appeals determined when reassignments do, and when they do not, constitute appealable RIFs.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reassignments accompanying changes in pay in the circumstances of reorganizations may constitute a RIF. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 346-52 (1993). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harants v. USPS</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Postal Service engaged in a reduction in force when, while threatening massive reorganizations and dislocations of employees, it offered employees "voluntary" reassignments and demotions to avoid the possibly adverse consequences of formal RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">Brown</span> touched on many aspects of the RIF process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until December 12, 1992, the appellant was employed as General Manager of the Accounting Division, St. Louis Postal Data Center, in St. Louis, Missouri. This position was classified at level 1 of the Postal Career Executive Service (PCES) pay method category. Sometime before August 6, 1992, the agency decided to undergo a "restructuring" to "reduce management layers in Headquarters and the field." In filling the positions in its restructured organizations, it solicited applications from people who were employed in its predecessor organizations. Although the appellant submitted an application in response to the agency's announcement, he was not among those selected for a PCES position in the restructured organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after it announced its selections for the PCES positions in the appellant's organization, the agency offered to place the appellant in the position of Manager, Support Services, EAS-25, a position at a lower grade than the one he previously had held. In making this offer, it advised the appellant that, although it would continue to attempt to place him if he declined the offer, he "should realize...that as the placement process continue[d], the remaining internal placement opportunities [would] diminish." It advised him further that his failure to accept the offer could result in his directed reassignment, and that there was "no guarantee that [his] preferences as to location and specific job responsibilities [could] be accommodated when such reassignments [were] made." The appellant accepted the offer and was assigned to the EAS-25 position. A few days after his acceptance, he filed this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his order acknowledging the appeal, the administrative judge noted that the Board might not have appellate jurisdiction over the action the appellant was challenging. He therefore provided the parties with an opportunity to address this matter. After considering the parties' submissions, he issued an order in which he found that, although the appellant's assignment did not constitute an appealable adverse action, it did constitute an appealable reduction-in-force action. Thereafter, he certified the agency's objection to the ruling as an interlocutory appeal and stayed the adjudication of the case pending the Board's consideration of the interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A preference-eligible employee of the Postal Service who has been demoted by a reduction-in-force action is entitled to appeal that action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 3501(b); 39 USC 1005(a)(2); 5 CFR 351.901; Federal Personnel Manual Supplement (FPM Supp.) 351-1, S2-2a(1)(c); <span class="Italic">Raymond v. United States Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 16, 18 (1990) (preference-eligible employees of the Postal Service have the same rights as competitive service employees under title 5, U.S. Code). The agency in this appeal acknowledges, and the record indicates, that the appellant is a preference-eligible employee. He therefore is entitled to appeal his assignment to the EAS-25 position if that action is a demotion covered by 5 CFR part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency releases an employee covered by 5 CFR part 351 from his competitive level by demotion as a result of a reorganization, it is required to follow the procedures of that part. 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2). The "restructuring" that led to the action at issue here--a process that involved replacing one set of organizations with another....<span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.203 ("reorganization" defined, for purposes of 5 CFR part 351, as "the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization"). Furthermore, because the position to which the agency assigned the appellant is at a grade level different from that of his former position, and because positions may not be included in the same competitive level unless they are all at the same grade, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 351.403(a), we find that the appellant was released from his competitive level. The agency argues, however, that the appellant has not been demoted, and that he therefore is not entitled to appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "demotion" is defined at 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4)[3] as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency...[t]o a position with a lower rate of pay when...the old and the new positions...are in different pay method categories." The agency acknowledges that it has assigned the appellant to a position outside the pay method category (the PCES category) of his former position, and it does not deny that the position to which it has assigned the appellant has a lower rate of pay than the appellant's former position. It argues, however, that, because it has provided the appellant with indefinite retained grade and pay, the appellant has not been reduced in grade or pay, and that, in the absence of such a reduction, there can be no demotion and, accordingly, no appealable reduction-in-force action. For the reasons described below, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This definition applies generally to chapter 1 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, which includes the reduction-in-force regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 210.101; 5 CFR part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the definition of "demotion" refers to "a position with a lower rate of pay." The language of this definition is tied to the employee's assigned position, not to the employee himself; accordingly, it is the position whose rate of pay determines whether there has been a demotion.[6] <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McGauley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 686, 689 (1986) (reduction-in-force "regulations speak specifically to a 'demotion' rather than a reduction in grade or pay").[7] Furthermore, we note that 5 USC 5361(3) indicates that a retained grade is considered relevant only for a limited purpose--i.e., for the purpose of determining the benefits to which an employee is entitled. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5361(3) (defining "retained grade" as "the grade used for determining benefits to which an employee...is entitled").[8] Although an employee's entitlement to retained grade and pay may divest the Board of jurisdiction over certain otherwise-Appealable demotions, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 5366(b), it does not cause those actions to be other than demotions. Moreover, even if the absence of Board appellate jurisdiction were to cause an action to fall outside the regulatory definition of "demotion," this would have no bearing on the action at issue here; an employee's entitlement to retained grade and pay has no effect on the employee's right to appeal a reduction-in-force action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 5366(a)(2). Accordingly, we see no indication in the statutory provisions regarding retained grade and pay, in the regulatory definition of "demotion" quoted above, or elsewhere[9] that an employee's retained grade or retained pay determines whether an employee has been demoted. In sum, we find based upon the foregoing definitional analysis that the appellant's assignment to an EAS-25 position constituted a demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency notes that, in <span class="Italic">Malan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 290 n.5 (1992), the Board stated that a demotion was "defined as a reduction in either grade or pay." We do not interpret this statement, however, as indicating that a demotion cannot occur in the absence of a concurrent reduction in the employee's grade or pay. In fact, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Malan</span> that the appellant had been subjected to an appealable adverse action--a reduction in pay--even though the agency had provided him with retained pay instead of reducing his salary at the time of the action at issue<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 290-91. Accordingly, we find that <span class="Italic">Malan</span> offers no support for the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The agency asserts that the Board found the regulatory definition quoted above inapplicable in <span class="Italic">McGauley</span> "because the old and new positions both were in the General Schedule." We note, however, that the only significance of the fact that two General Schedule positions were involved in that case was that the Board's determination was made under the first part of the regulatory definition, which concerns assignments in which both positions are in the General Schedule, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4)(i), rather than under the second part, which concerns assignments such as the one at issue in the present appeal--i.e., assignments from one pay method category to another, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4)(ii). Nothing in <span class="Italic">McGauley</span> indicates that its holding applies only to the first part of the regulatory definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The term "retained pay" is not expressly defined in the subchapter of the regulations that includes provisions relevant to retained grade and pay. That subchapter does indicate, however, that retained pay is a more limited benefit to which an employee may be entitled when he is not entitled to the benefits of retained grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5363.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The agency cites the following Board and court decisions indicating that a possible loss of future pay increases does not cause an assignment to be an appealable reduction in grade or pay: <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 807 F.2d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Garbacz v. United States</span>, 656 F.2d 628, 228 Ct. Cl. 309 (1981); <span class="Italic">Goettmann, et al. v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 9 MSPB 363, 10 MSPR 95 (1982); and <span class="Italic">Peele v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 6 MSPB 253, 6 MSPR 296 (1981). The circumstances at issue in those decisions, however, are distinguishable from those of the present <span id="Page_3029"></span>appeal. In <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, the employee was reassigned from one position to another at the same grade, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 807 F.2d at 1578-79; in <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span>, the pay scale of the grade to which the employees were converted was the same as that of their former grade, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Garbacz</span>, 656 F.2d at 631; in <span class="Italic">Goettmann</span>, the employees were challenging only the agency's failure, due to the employees' prior receipt of retained pay, to increase their pay when it promoted them, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Goettmann</span>, 10 MSPR at 96, and in <span class="Italic">Peele</span>, the employee was assigned to an unclassified position, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Peele</span>, 6 MSPR at 299. None of these cases concerned reduction-in-force actions, and none concerned an assignment to a position with a lower rate of pay than that of the employee's former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues further that, even if the action at issue here constitutes a demotion, it is not an appealable reduction-in-force action because it was voluntary. In support of this argument, it asserts that the action is of a kind described in Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 351-1 as a possible alternative to effecting reduction-in-force actions, and that the appellant could have elected to decline the offer of assignment and await another opportunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cited Federal Personnel Manual provision does indicate that an agency may minimize the need for a reduction in force by "permit[ting] a voluntary change to lower grade." FPM Supp. 351-1, S1-3b. The same provision also indicates, however, that this alternative is to be used "[a]s part of pre-RIF placement efforts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant was offered assignment to an EAS-25 position only after he was informed that he would not be retained in his former position or placed in another PCES position. The timing of this offer, along with the agency's statements regarding the adverse consequences that might result from the appellant's failure to accept the offer, place the offer outside the scope of a "pre-RIF placement effort," and cause it to be comparable to an offer of assignment under subpart G of the reduction-in-force regulations.[12] As the administrative judge noted in the order at issue here, the Board has held that its jurisdiction over a reduction-in-force action cannot be defeated by an assertion that the employee consented to the action. <span class="Italic">Payne v. Department of the Interior</span>, 32 MSPR 619, 622 (1987). We therefore find that this appellant's "voluntary" acceptance of the agency's offer of assignment to an EAS-25 position does not preclude Board jurisdiction over this appeal under the reduction-in-force regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The agency also relies on a provision, in the same section of Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 351-1, that an agency may reassign employees without regard to the reduction in force regulations "so long as employees are not involuntarily reduced in grade." <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supp. 351-1, S1-3b. A "reassignment," however, is defined as "a change of an employee...from one position to another without...demotion." 5 CFR 210.102(b)(12). Because we find that the action at issue here constitutes a demotion, this provision of the Federal Personnel Manual also is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sakagawa v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 418, 422-23 (1993) ("The appellant's request for consideration for his present position therefore appears to be, in effect, only an expression of his preferences among jobs to which the agency was considering demoting him after having failed to place him in a PCES position.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 430, 434-36 (1993), declined to deviate from <span class="Italic">Brown</span> on the theory that, strictly speaking, demotions were within the same pay schedule. <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> commented on the postal reorganization, first quoting from the then-current version of 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Demotion</span> means a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;To a lower grade when both the old and the new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;To a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second part of this definition does not appear applicable to this appeal. As we have indicated above, the appellant's former and current positions are both in the same pay method category, the EAS category. In addition, because each position has been assigned a grade, the appellant cannot be said to have been assigned from or to a position under an "ungraded wage schedule."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If applied in a strictly literal sense, the first part of the definition also could be said to be inapplicable to the assignment at issue here. Neither the appellant's former position nor his current position is classified under the General Schedule; and neither the Office of Personnel Management, which promulgated this regulatory definition, nor the agency that is a party to this appeal appears to use the term "wage schedule" in connection with positions such as those in the EAS pay method category....&#8197;It could be argued, therefore, that the assignment at issue here does not constitute a demotion under 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that this narrow reading of the regulatory definition would be inconsistent with the regulation's general import. When viewed as a whole, 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) indicates that the term "demotion" is intended to mean an assignment to a position at a lower level on the same scale than the employee's former position or, if the assignment involves two different scales and this relatively simple comparison is not possible, assignment to a position with a lower rate of pay. We also can discern no reason for treating assignments between two positions in the same Postal Service pay method category differently than assignments between two General Schedule positions and assignments between two positions under the "same type graded wage schedule." Accordingly, we hold that assignment to a lower-grade position, when both positions are in the same Postal Service pay method category, is equivalent, for purposes of this definition, to the kind of assignment described in 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not deny that it has assigned the appellant to a position in the same pay method category that is at a lower grade than his former position. It asserts, however, that it has provided him with indefinite retained grade and pay, and it argues that the appellant therefore has not been demoted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency has noted, a similar jurisdictional issue was presented to the Board in an interlocutory appeal that was pending before the Board when this interlocutory appeal was certified. In the earlier appeal, <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service,</span> 58 MSPR 345 (1993) (order affirming finding of jurisdiction), as in the one now before us, the employee was assigned, as a result of a reorganization, to a position that evidently had a lower rate of pay than the employee's former position. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, at 348-349. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, we found unpersuasive the agency's argument that it had not demoted the employee because it had provided him with indefinite retained grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 349. We held that the rate of pay of the position to which the employee was assigned, rather than any retained grade or pay the agency had provided him, determined whether the employee had been demoted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 349-351. We concluded, therefore, that the employee had been demoted despite his receipt of indefinite retained grade and pay<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, 351. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, we find that the appellant in the present appeal has been demoted despite his receipt of retained grade and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues further that, even if the appellant's assignment to his EAS-16 position constitutes a demotion, that action is not appealable under reduction-in-force regulations because it was voluntary. In support of this argument, it asserts that this kind of action is mentioned in Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 351-1 as a possible alternative to effecting a reduction-in-force action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, in response to the same argument, the cited Federal Personnel Manual provision concerns reassignments and "pre-RIF placement efforts." <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supp. 351-1, S1-3b; <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, at 351 &#x0026; n.12. The action at issue here does not constitute a reassignment because it instead constitutes a demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(12) ("reassignment" defined as "a change of an employee...from one position to another without...demotion"); <span class="Italic">Brown</span> at 351 n.12. In addition, as in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> at 351-352, we find that the appellant's assignment to an EAS position does not constitute a voluntary change to lower grade that was "permit[ted]" by the agency "[a]s part of a pre-RIF placement effort." Although, as the agency points out, the appellant stated in a note to his supervisor that he "<span class="Italic">definitely</span> want[ed]" the EAS-16 position at issue, he made this statement only after he had been informed that he had been "impacted by the restructuring," after the agency had advised him that "all affected employees' [assignment] preferences [might] not be honored," and after his effort to be assigned to a higher grade position had been unsuccessful. In addition, the appellant's acceptance of the EAS-16 position was preceded by the agency's issuance of a memorandum, evidently circulated among employees, indicating that, "[a]fter the initial placements, unplaced employees will be subject to directed reassignments." Under these circumstances, we find that the assignment at issue is outside the scope of a "pre-RIF placement effort," and that it is comparable to an assignment under subpart G of the reduction-in-force regulations. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, at 351-352, the Board's jurisdiction over a reduction-in-force action cannot be defeated by an assertion that the employee consented to the action by accepting an offer of assignment to another position. Accordingly, we find that this appellant's "voluntary" acceptance of his EAS-16 position does not preclude Board jurisdiction over this appeal under the reduction-in-force regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vercelli v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 322, 325 (1996) ("A demotion under RIF regulations is a change to a lower-graded position when both positions are in the same Postal Service pay method equivalent.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> led to a number of remands to the regions of RIF appeals initiated by employees who claimed they were downgraded as a result of the Postal Service restructuring. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Randall v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 199 (1993).<span class="Italic"> Brown</span> was revisited, partially at the behest and intervention of OPM, in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 307, 310-21, 323-24, 326-28, 330, 331 (1994), explaining why the Postal Service needed to undo a massive reorganization:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3030"></span>The agency and OPM note that the RIF regulations previously provided employees with a right to appeal reassignments, even when those actions did not require displacement, and that the right to appeal reassignments not requiring displacement was eliminated when OPM revised those regulations in 1983. They indicate further that the reason for this regulatory change was that a reassignment did not affect the grade, pay, or tenure of the reassigned employee. Because the intent of the RIF regulations is to provide appeal rights only to employees whose grade, pay, or tenure have been affected, they argue, and because the assignments at issue here have not affected the grade, pay, or tenure of any of the appellants, the regulations should not be construed as giving the Board jurisdiction over those actions. OPM also characterizes the RIF regulations as they have existed since 1983--i.e., since they were modified to exclude the right to appeal reassignments not requiring displacement--as embodying a "'no harm-no appeal' principle," and it asserts that this principle is "the primary reason" the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellants' assignments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's announcement of the 1983 regulatory revision does show that the 1983 regulatory change was based on OPM's conclusion that a RIF reassignment did not affect the grade, pay, or tenure of the reassigned employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 48 Fed. Reg. 49,462, 49,463 (1983) (supplementary information explaining regulatory change); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 51 Fed. Reg. 318, 319 (1986). The change on which the agency and OPM rely, however, affected only reassignments. There is no indication in the Federal Register announcements on which OPM and the agency rely of an intention to limit in any way the right to appeal RIF demotions to the Board, and in fact the revised regulations include no such limitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unpersuasive OPM's argument that a "'no harm-no appeal' principle" underlying the current RIF regulations causes the Board to lack jurisdiction over the appellants' assignments. Underlying this argument, apparently, is a belief or assumption that indefinite saved grade is sufficient to eliminate the harm resulting from an assignment to a lower-grade position because it precludes any loss of pay resulting from the assignment. For the reasons stated below, we do not concur in this belief or assumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The psychological benefits of working in a relatively responsible and prestigious position are demonstrated by the fact that these appellants have appealed their assignments despite their receipt of indefinite saved grade and pay. Furthermore, although the agency has indicated that the "saved grade" an employee receives as a result of an assignment to a lower-grade position "is that employee's grade for every purpose including...promotional opportunities," we note that the agency does not have an unlimited ability to ensure that this intention is carried out....&#8197;Although an employee assigned to a lower-grade position gains experience that may enable him to advance beyond the lower-grade position he occupies, that experience is unlikely to further his ability to advance beyond his "saved grade" level. We also note that, even if the agency were able to ensure that the employee would receive undiminished consideration for positions within the agency for which his previous, higher-level position qualified him, it still could not control the consideration the employee would receive from employers outside the agency. In addition, the longer the employee occupies the lower-level position, the more obsolete his knowledge of his previous position is likely to be....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find further that the history of the RIF regulations reflects a purpose of protecting employees not only from loss of or reduction in their salaries, but also from other kinds of harm associated with the loss of their positions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that legislation affecting employees' RIF rights reflects a similar congressional intent. When Congress expanded the 1958 retained-pay provisions described above to include retained-grade provisions for certain employees affected by RIF demotions, it specifically provided that entitlement to retained grade was not to be construed as affecting employees' rights to appeal any RIF action<span class="Italic">. See</span> Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 801(a)(1), 92 Stat. 1111, 1221, codified at 5 USC 5366(a)(2)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellants' assignments constituted demotions, and not reassignments....&#8197;[T]he definition of "demotion" that appears at 5 CFR 210.102(b)(4) applies generally to chapter I of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which includes OPM's RIF regulations. 5 CFR 210.101; 5 CFR part 351. That definition consists of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Demotion</span> means a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;To a lower grade when both the old and the new positions are under the General Schedule or under the same type graded wage schedule; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;To a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions are under the same type ungraded wage schedule, or are in different pay method categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR 210.102(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the critical phrase in this definition is "change of an employee," that the appellants in these appeals have not been "changed" because they are receiving indefinite saved grade and pay, and that, even if they could be regarded as having been "changed" in some way, paragraph (i) is inapplicable here because it applies only to situations in which the employees have been changed to lower grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. Each paragraph of the definition refers to a situation in which there has been a change from one position to another, and in which the latter position is at a lower grade or lower pay level than the former position. This alone strongly indicates that the issue of whether a demotion has occurred is to be resolved with reference to the relative grades or pay levels of the positions, rather than the relative grades or pay levels of the employees who occupy those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that paragraph (ii) of the definition cannot reasonably be construed as referring to any change in the employee's pay or other benefits. Instead, that paragraph refers only to the relative pay levels of the employee's former and current positions. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 99, 103 (1994) (agency released employee from her competitive level by demotion when it assigned her to a position with a lower representative rate of pay than that of her former position). It would be inappropriate to construe the two paragraphs as using two entirely different standards for determining whether a demotion has occurred--i.e., to construe paragraph (i) as indicating that an employee has been demoted only when his pay has been affected, while construing paragraph (ii) as indicating that he has been demoted whenever he has been assigned to a lower-grade position. Under such an approach, an employee's assignment to a relatively low-paid position could be regarded as a demotion if the two positions were in different pay method categories (and therefore covered by paragraph (ii)), but not if the two positions were in the same pay method category (and therefore covered by paragraph (i)). Clearly, the two paragraphs of the regulatory definition of "demotion" are intended to refer to equivalent situations that, because of the existence of different position classification and compensation systems, must be evaluated by somewhat different methods in order to reach consistent and equitable results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is inconsistent with the Board's own regulations and precedent. With respect to the former, it cites 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(10) and argues that this provision describes the Board's jurisdiction over RIF appeals as limited to appeals of separations, reductions in grade, and furloughs. That part of the Board's regulations, however, consists only of a list of actions that are "include[d]" in the Board's appellate jurisdiction. Furthermore, the regulatory provision on which the agency relies consists only of descriptive information, and is not a source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Cade v. Department of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 107, 110 n.4 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1018 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table). The omission of any reference to demotions not accompanied by reductions in grade therefore cannot serve as a basis for finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over these appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted above, each of the appellants was assigned from one EAS position to another EAS position at a lower grade. We held in <span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 430, 435 (1993), that assignment to a lower-grade position, when both positions were in the same Postal Service pay method category, constitutes a demotion. Accordingly, we find that the assignments at issue in these appeals constitute demotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in this case includes a statement, signed under penalty of perjury, in which the agency's Vice President for Labor Relations, Joseph J. Mahon, Jr., described the circumstances under which the agency decided to effect actions resulting from its restructuring without applying RIF procedures. In that statement, Mr. Mahon described the purpose of the restructuring and noted that it had been "expected to, and did, result in the elimination of 30,000 overhead positions, most of which were administrative and management (EAS) positions." He stated further that the agency had consulted with other organizations, and that the "consensus which emerged from these contacts was that a reduction in force (RIF) should be used only as a last resort and that alternatives should be pursued." In addition, he explained that a "RIF was seen as too disruptive to operations and the Postal Service's ability to provide consistent, reliable mail service to the American public; too complicated, expensive, and time-consuming; too likely to have an adverse effect on minorities and women in the workforce; and too likely to produce harsh, arbitrary results in individual cases." An agency document that was circulated among employees in or about August 1992, and that outlined the agency's plans for implementing the restructuring, further indicates that the agency wished to avoid using the RIF procedures because a "[m]ajor employee records review" would have been needed before the <span id="Page_3031"></span>RIF "to avoid mistakes," because the agency would have had "[l]imited ability to deny placement to employee[s] with highest retention standing," because displaced employees' assignment rights would have "delay[ed] getting [a] stable new structure in place," and because there was a "high risk of reversal [of appealed RIF actions] given [the agency's] lack of RIF experience and need to move quickly."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's desire to minimize the disruption and expenses caused by a major reorganization, and to minimize the reorganization's adverse effects on its employees, is both understandable and commendable. The methods an agency may take to achieve these goals, however, do not include disregarding applicable statutory and regulatory provisions. Those provisions give employees rights that must be protected even when their protection is inconvenient for the agency. In short, adherence to the RIF regulations is mandatory wherever those regulations are applicable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2) ("[e]ach agency <span class="Italic">shall follow</span> this part when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by...demotion") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the agency nor OPM appears to argue that the circumstances under which appellant Yruegas was demoted differ in any material way from those under which the appellant in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was demoted. Instead, they argue that the Board erred in holding that circumstances such as those in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> were insufficient to divest the Board of jurisdiction over an assignment. First, they argue that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is inconsistent with FPM Supplement 351-1, S1-3b, which provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an agency anticipating a RIF may minimize the need for RIF actions by "permit[ting] a voluntary change to lower grade." In support of this argument, they assert that a "pre-RIF" action such as this may be effected without use of RIF procedures at any time before the scheduled date of the RIF, and that the use of RIF procedures is not mandated simply because such a voluntary action is not taken before the employee is informed that he will not be retained in his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find this argument persuasive. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> indicates that the agency may not effect voluntary actions before--and in lieu of--scheduled RIF actions. Instead, we found in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that the allegedly voluntary action was itself a RIF action. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 58 MSPR at 351. Furthermore, nothing in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> indicates that a "pre-RIF" action not requiring the use of RIF procedures may be effected only before the employee is aware that he will not be retained in his position. Such a position would, as the agency and OPM point out, be inconsistent with Board precedent....&#8197;<span class="Italic">Brown</span> does indicate, however, that the fact that an agency offer to assign an employee occurred after the employee had been notified that he would not be retained in his position or elsewhere in his competitive level could be a factor in determining whether the offer is comparable to a RIF assignment offer....&#8197;We see no error in this aspect of <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. Because RIF assignments under subpart G of the RIF regulations are offered after the agency has determined that the affected employee has been reached for release from his competitive level, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 351.701(a), the fact that the assignment offer in question was similarly timed supports a finding that it was comparable to a RIF assignment offer under subpart G.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the agency appears to argue that <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is inconsistent with the FPM provision cited above in that it does not permit a voluntary reduction in grade in anticipation of a RIF. We see nothing in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that supports this argument. Instead, the part of <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that is relevant to this issue simply stands for the propositions (1) that an employee's acceptance of a RIF assignment offer cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction over the resulting action, if that action is otherwise appealable to the Board under the RIF regulations, and (2) that an agency's offer of assignment must be treated, for jurisdictional purposes, as an assignment offer under subpart G of the RIF regulations if the circumstances under which the offer was made show that the offer was, in effect, a subpart G assignment offer. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 58 MSPR at 351-52. We see no error in these holdings. As we indicated in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board has held that its jurisdiction over a RIF action cannot be defeated by an assertion that the employee consented to the action by accepting an offer of demotion....&#8197;A contrary holding would, in effect, virtually divest the Board of its jurisdiction over RIF demotions, since such actions generally (if not always) result from employees' acceptances of assignments to lower-grade positions in lieu of separation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the particular circumstances of appellant Yruegas's assignment offer, the agency and OPM contend that the assignment was voluntary because the appellant could have waited for other assignments, because he might have been assigned to a position at his former grade level if he had declined the offer, and because he accepted the offer after being informed that the agency had a "no-layoff" policy and that he would receive indefinite saved grade and pay in any position to which he was assigned....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although circumstances such as those described by the agency and OPM may be relevant in determining whether an action constitutes an appealable adverse action, none of them are relevant in a RIF context. In all, or virtually all, RIF cases in which the employees accept initial offers of assignment to lower-grade positions, the employees could have declined the offers in the hope that they would receive better offers. In fact, even employees who accept initial RIF assignment offers may be provided with better offers before any RIF actions are effected--sometimes including offers of assignment at their current grade levels--since acceptance of one offer does not relieve the agency of any obligation it may have under the RIF regulations to offer the employee assignment to a position at a grade higher than that of the previously offered position. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 CFR 351.701, 351.704(a)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency asserts that, because the appellants will continue to be paid at the grade levels of their former positions, they have received all their substantive rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has long recognized that employees' RIF assignment rights are substantive....&#8197;[T]he appellants' demotions cannot be sustained unless the agency establishes that its failure to apply the RIF regulations had no adverse effect on the appellants' assignment rights. Not only has the agency failed to make such a showing, but it concedes that it is not even alleging that such a showing could be made. We agree with the administrative judge that, in light of the agency's complete failure to follow RIF procedures, including its failure to establish competitive areas and competitive levels, the appellants' demotions cannot be sustained....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">One considers the context of an employee's position movement to determine the occurrence of a RIF.

<p class="Body-Text">One factor distinguishing an appealable from a nonappealable voluntary downgrading during a reorganization is whether the employee was advised that he would be retained at the same competitive level and whether the employee volunteered to participate in a "return-to-craft" program before the agency took action regarding his or her reassignment. The Federal Circuit attempted to harmonize the MSPB's different approaches to postal downgradings, <span class="Italic">Torain v. USPS</span>, 83 F.3d 1420, 1421-23 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">aff'g</span> 68 MSPR 479 (1995)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1992, Torain served as a Superintendent Engineer for the USPS in New York City at a grade of Executive and Administrative Schedule (EAS) Level 11 with an annual salary of $36,964. In 1992 and 1993, the USPS conducted a nationwide restructuring to eliminate approximately 48,000 managerial positions, including Torain's supervisory position. During this period Torain was notified that although he might be required to accept an assignment at a new geographic location, he was not in danger of being laid off or receiving a reduction in pay or grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In early 1993, the USPS announced that supervisors affected by the restructuring but not yet reassigned were eligible to participate in an incentive program under which they could receive cash payments for accepting bargaining unit (craft) positions in lieu of reassignment. The announcement stated that employees had to request participation in the incentive program by May 17, 1993 and then had until June 30, 1993 to complete the formal acceptance procedures. Under this "return-to-craft" program participating employees would receive cash payments of two times the difference between their current annual base pay and the current annual base pay of the craft position that they were offered under the program. On June 21, 1993, Torain requested participation in the return-to-craft program. In response, Torain received an "Offer of Assignment to Craft Position," for the position of Laborer Custodian at a grade of Postal Service (PS) Level 3 with an annual salary of $33,603, plus an incentive payment of $8,726. Torain accepted this offer on June 22, 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following Torain's reassignment to the craft position, the MSPB issued several decisions which held for certain employees the 1992-93 restructuring resulted in an appealable RIF action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 430 (1993); <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345 (1993). These USPS employees were told that under the restructuring they would not be reassigned to positions at the same competitive level, but that they would be placed in positions with the same pay and grade. The MSPB held that the assignment of these employees from their competitive levels to lower level positions resulted in a constructive demotion. Because these preference-eligible employees were demoted pursuant to a reorganization, the board found that it had jurisdiction to hear the challenged actions under the reductions-in-force (RIF) regulations. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 307 (1994) (elaborating on the basis for the decisions in <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span>); <span class="Italic">White v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 299 (1994) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following these decisions, Torain filed an appeal with the MSPB alleging that he had been constructively demoted. Torain asserted that he requested and accepted the craft position only because of the threat that he would be involuntarily reassigned to another geographic location. He argued that this amounted to a constructive demotion. Torain also argued that his decision to accept the offer to return to craft was involuntary because of the prospect of being reassigned to a different geographic area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge (AJ) agreed that the USPS had demoted Torain and that the action was appealable under the RIF regulations. On review by the full board, however, the initial decision was vacated and the appeal dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The board distinguished the <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span> cases on the ground that the USPS never informed Torain that he would not be retained at the same competitive level. The board also emphasized that Torain volunteered to participate in the return-to-craft incentive program before the USPS had taken any action regarding his reassignment. Accordingly, the board rejected Torain's argument that his decision to accept the craft position was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preference-eligible employee of the USPS, Torain asserted that the MSPB had jurisdiction based on his alleged constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2108(3) (1994) (defining preference-eligible employee)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Krizman v. MSPB</span>, 77 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996), this court recently considered whether a preference-eligible employee affected by the USPS restructuring voluntarily agreed to participate in the agency's special early retirement incentive program. After the issuance of the <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span> decisions, the employee in <span class="Italic">Krizman</span> appealed to the MSPB alleging a constructive demotion. The employee claimed that he would not have retired had he known that the restructuring constituted a RIF and that his choice to retire was thus involuntary. The MSPB dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and this court affirmed. We held that the employee never suffered an appealable RIF action because he voluntarily chose to retire, explaining:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although [the employee] was a preference-eligible employee, the Postal Service had no obligation to advise him of his RIF rights, because he was never subjected to an appealable RIF action--that is, he was never demoted, furloughed, or separated as a result of the restructuring. <span class="Italic">Because he was not "selected for release from a competitive level," he was not entitled to notice of information regarding his status, and he was not entitled to notice of his appeal rights.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 438 (citations omitted) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Mueller v. USPS</span>, 76 F.3d 1198, 1201 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("An agency has no obligation under the RIF regulations or otherwise, to give an employee notice of the right to appeal a RIF action to the Board if a RIF action has not been taken against that employee.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We consider <span class="Italic">Krizman</span> and <span class="Italic">Mueller</span> binding precedent. The only difference between those cases and this appeal is that those employees voluntarily took advantage of the retirement incentive program whereas here Torain voluntarily accepted the offer under the return-to-craft incentive program. In each situation the employee's decision to accept the incentive program offer occurred prior to any agency action. The board held that Torain made a voluntary decision regarding the return-to-craft program because at the time Torain decided to accept the incentive the USPS had not indicated that he would be subject to an appealable action<span class="Italic">. See Cooley v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 353 (1995). The board explained: "[Torain] was not subject to a RIF action because, although the agency abolished the appellant's supervisory position, at the time he accepted the agency's return-to-craft offer, the agency had not informed him that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level, or that he would not be retained in another EAS position." The board further stated that Torain simply had to make a difficult decision, either to await a reassignment at a new geographic location or participate in the return-to-craft incentive program. We agree with the board's reasoning that he voluntarily chose the latter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Krizman</span> and <span class="Italic">Mueller</span> explain that where an employee requests and agrees to accept early retirement under the special incentive program before any appealable action has been taken by the agency no appeal rights accrue. Here, the USPS had not indicated to Torain that he would be placed in any position other than one at his former grade level. Thus the board correctly determined that the agency did not breach any obligation to notify Torain of RIF rights because he neither received notice of reassignment to a lower level position nor was he released from the agency prior to accepting the return-to-craft offer. Under the circumstances, Torain might have been reassigned at a grade level that would not require any RIF notification. As in <span class="Italic">Krizman</span> and <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, Torain simply accepted an alternative employment option in lieu of waiting for eventual reassignment. Torain had a choice, and the board properly held that he was bound by that decision. <span class="Italic">See Latham v. USPS</span>, 909 F.2d 500, 502 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (where an employee makes a voluntary choice regarding employment rights, the party is bound by that decision); <span class="Italic">but see Schultz v. United States</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (if the agency's terms of an employment decision permit no alternative but to accept, such circumstances are not voluntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Torain also argues his acceptance of the craft position was involuntary because it was based on erroneous or misleading RIF information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (an action taken by an employee may be "involuntary if it is obtained by agency misinformation or deception"). As we have explained, however, Torain was not entitled to notification of RIF rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because Torain voluntarily accepted the craft position prior to agency action, neither a demotion nor an appealable RIF action occurred. <span class="Italic">Roche v. USPS</span>, 80 F.3d 468, 479-471 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3332) ("Because Mr. Jones made his decision to seek placement in the North Granville position prior to any RIF action by the USPS, Mr. Jones was not subjected to a RIF action, and he does not have grounds for appeal to the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roche v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 141, 145-51 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Roche v. USPS</span>, 80 F.3d 468 (1996), found no appealable action when the appellants were offered <span id="Page_3033"></span>geographical reassignments that would have resulted in no pay or grade cuts, but the appellants instead requested local reassignments to positions at lower grades:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the actions at issue here were effected, the appellants all were employed at the Postal Data Center (PDC) in New York, New York, where they were assigned to positions whose grades ranged from DCS-9 to DCS-20. In the summer of 1992, the agency decided to close the New York PDC as part of a nationwide consolidation of its PDC functions. By notices dated December 14, 1992, the agency informed the appellants that it was closing the New York PDC and assigning each appellant to one of five other PDCs in other parts of the country. It informed each of them further that he would "be assigned to a position or duties to [sic] which [he was] qualified," and that, if he was "assigned to a position at a lower grade, [he would] continue to maintain [his] existing grade level and salary in accordance with the provisions of Article 40 Section 5 of the Postal Data Centers Agreement." By notices dated December 21, 1992, the agency informed nineteen of the appellants of the specific positions to which they were to be assigned in their new organizations--positions at the same grade as the positions from which the appellants were being assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of the appellants were assigned as scheduled. Instead, each requested and received, effective February 19, 1993, an assignment to a position in the local commuting area. The agency has not denied that, in each instance, the position to which the appellant was assigned was at a lower grade than that of the appellant's former position. The agency agreed, however, that the "appellants' grades and salaries [would] not be reduced...for a period of at least one year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency acknowledges that it did not follow RIF procedures in effecting the appellants' assignments. Nonetheless, for the reasons given below, we find that they never suffered an appealable RIF action, so that the Board lacks jurisdiction over their assignments under 5 CFR part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bissett v. United States Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 631 (1995), a case in which the appellant was informed by the agency that his position had been eliminated as part of its restructuring, he retired before any action to affect his grade, pay, or tenure was taken. The Board found that in the absence of his permanent reassignment prior to his retirement, it was possible that he might have been reassigned at the same grade level, or even promoted. Under the circumstances, we held that he could not have been released from his competitive level by demotion and therefore did not suffer a RIF before he retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our conclusion, the Board compared the situation in <span class="Italic">Bissett</span> to that in two other cases. In <span class="Italic">Hanson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 413, 415, 417-18 (1993), we found that the appellant's assignment to a lower-grade position constituted a RIF demotion despite the fact that he had applied for assignment to that position because he did so only after he had been informed that his position had been abolished in the restructuring and that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. And, in <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 347-48 (1993), we reached the same result because the appellant was placed in a lower graded position after being told that he would not be retained in his former position or retained in another Postal Career Executive Service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the appellants in <span class="Italic">Hanson</span> and <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, four of the appellants in the instant case were not told the grade level of their new position because the agency had not yet determined the work they would be doing in Minneapolis. Thus, as was true in <span class="Italic">Bissett</span>, it was possible that they might simply have been reassigned to positions at the same grade, or higher, thereby avoiding the need for a RIF notice entirely. The agency was still considering a variety of options it had to achieve its goals of reducing and restructuring itself. Only after the employees availed themselves of the available options would the agency know exactly which of its remaining employees would have to be moved, and which of them would have to be moved involuntarily, through RIF, to lower graded positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to those four appellants, the agency clearly failed to advise them that, if the positions in other PDCs to which they were assigned were at lower grades than the positions from which they were being assigned, the actions would be subject to the RIF regulations and could be appealed to the Board. Nonetheless, because the agency never notified them of their permanent reassignment to positions in other PDCs, we find that they had not been subjected to RIF actions by the time of their assignment to positions in New York which, for the reasons discussed below, we find were voluntary. We conclude, therefore, that they may not appeal those actions under part 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the nineteen appellants who were told that they would be assigned to positions of equal grade to those they already held, the actions would have constituted only nonappealable reassignments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2), 351.901. Furthermore, although even an assignment that is requested as an alternative to a nonappealable action may be an appealable adverse action under some circumstances, we know of no basis for finding that an agency must follow RIF procedures in effecting such an assignment. We therefore find that the assignments of these nineteen appellants also do not constitute RIF actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to address further the agency's arguments that none of the assignments at issue can constitute appealable actions because they were offered only as alternatives to nonappealable assignments to other geographic locations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not have appellate jurisdiction over voluntary actions. <span class="Italic">Barnett v. United States Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 125, 127 (1993). Employee-initiated actions are presumed to be voluntary....&#8197;An employee may rebut the presumption of voluntariness, however, and establish that a reduction in grade or pay that was effected pursuant to his request was in fact an adverse action under subchapter II of chapter 75, title 5, U.S. Code, by presenting sufficient evidence that the action resulted from circumstances such as agency duress or misinformation. <span class="Italic">E.g., Barthel v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245, 250-51, 252-53 (1988). As we have noted above, the appellants in this case have alleged that their assignments were involuntary and that they resulted in reductions in their grade and pay. The agency argues that the appellants were not affected by either reductions in grade or reductions in pay. We conclude that it is unnecessary to resolve this dispute, however, because even if the appellants could show that they were reduced in grade or pay,[6] we find, as discussed below, that any such reduction constituted a voluntary action on their part and is, for this reason, not within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">But see Marcoux v. United States Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 373, 377-80 (1994), holding that an assignment during the restructuring that constitutes a RIF may not be appealed as an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants claim, apparently in support of their allegation that their assignments were involuntary, that they were given only one week in which to decide whether to accept their assignments to other PDCs or to request local assignments. The amount of time an employee is allowed in which to make an employment decision may be relevant in determining whether the employee was able to exercise his own free choice. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 12, 15 (1986). In this case, however, the appellants have failed to show that their decision to request and accept the assignments at issue was coerced by time pressure. They acknowledge that they were advised in September 1992--about 4 months before the January date by which they allegedly were asked to make their decisions--that the New York PDC would be closed. Furthermore, as we have noted above, the record shows that the appellants were informed by notices dated December 14, 1992, of the PDCs to which the agency planned to assign them. In addition, there is no indication in the record that any of the appellants attempted at any time before the effective date of the local assignments to withdraw their requests. In fact, the appellants still do not appear to be attempting to do so; instead, they seem to be requesting only that the agency provide them with indefinite grade and pay retention. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellants were allowed ample time in which to decide whether to request and accept the assignments at issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants also assert that the agency refused to allow them to bid for certain categories of positions that required skills many of them possessed, and they seem to argue that this refusal left them with no alternative to making the requests they made. An agency has broad discretion, however, in managing its work force and in deciding which positions to fill. <span class="Italic">See Cox v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 41 MSPR 686, 689 (1989). The agency's apparent refusal to include certain positions among those it was making available as alternatives to the appellants' scheduled assignments to other PDCs does not cause the appellants' requests for alternative assignments to be involuntary. <span class="Italic">Cf. Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587-88, 207 Ct. Cl. 333 (1975) (the fact that an employee is faced with unpleasant alternatives does not cause the employee's choice of one of those alternatives to be involuntary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellants seem to be arguing that the agency misled them about its authority to take the actions it took or proposed to take. An employee-initiated action is considered involuntary if it resulted from the employee's reasonable reliance on the agency's misleading statements, or from the agency's failure to provide the employee adequate information on which to make an informed choice. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). This is true even if the agency, in providing the misleading information or in failing to provide adequate information, had no intention of deceiving or misleading the employee. <span class="Italic">See id; see also Scharf v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983). For the reasons stated below, however, we find that the appellants have failed to establish that their requests for, and acceptance of, their local assignments resulted from their reliance on any misleading statements by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the appellants assert in their petition for review, as they did below, that the applicable collective bargaining agreement <span id="Page_3034"></span>prohibited the agency from taking RIF actions against covered employees. They seem to argue further that, in the absence of any authority to take RIF actions, the agency had no authority either to assign them to other geographic areas or to local lower-grade positions, and that, by indicating to the appellants that it had this authority, it misled them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have found above, however, their actions in these cases precluded the agency's potential need to take any RIF action. Thus, the appellants' assignments to their local positions were not rendered involuntary by virtue of the lack of notice of RIF appeal rights. An agency is obligated to notify an employee of RIF rights only at the time that it notifies him that he is to be reassigned to a lower graded position or released from the service. The appellants never received such notice. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 65 MSPR at 309-313 (the appellant was not entitled to notice of his RIF rights where, by the time he retired, the agency had not decided to take any action as to him that would be a RIF). <span class="Italic">See also Smitka v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 680 (1995), similarly finding that the absence of notice of RIF rights does not render a request for alternate assignment involuntary where the appellants were never subjected to a RIF.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Although an action initiated by the employee in response to a threatened involuntary personnel action is considered involuntary if the employee shows that the agency knew or believed that the threatened action could not be substantiated, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Christie</span>, 518 F.2d at 588, the appellants in the present appeal have made no such showing. While any assignments to lower-grade positions in other PDCs would have been covered by the RIF regulations, and while the agency evidently had no intention of applying those regulations in connection with the assignments, there is no evidence that the agency knew or believed that the RIF regulations would have been applicable. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 306, 311 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, further, that the appellants have not shown that the lack of information about what might have occurred if they had been assigned to lower-grade jobs elsewhere materially affected their decisions to remain in New York. Nowhere in the record is there an indication that any of them would have preferred any kind of assignment in another geographic location--even assignment to positions at the same grade as their former positions--to the local assignments they requested. Instead, the appellants indicate in their petition for review that the only remedial relief they seek is indefinite grade and pay retention in their present positions. Evidently, it was the appellants' desire to avoid relocating, rather than any inaccurate belief that the agency would have unfettered authority to assign them to lower-grade positions in a new PDC, that prompted their requests for local assignments. Finally, we note that, although the RIF regulations and the collective bargaining agreement provision mentioned above might have interfered with the agency's ability to assign the appellants to lower-grade PDC positions, it would have had no effect on the agency's authority to abolish the appellants' positions or to assign them to positions at the same grade levels in other geographic locations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we conclude that the absence of additional information about potential RIF rights does not render the appellants' assignments involuntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 640, 643 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Eubanks v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 159, 161 (1997), the Board attempted to avoid characterizing as a Postal Service reorganization reassignments accepted in advance of a RIF and before the employees' release from their competitive levels. These decisions were effectively overruled by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Harants v. USPS</span>, 130 F.3d 1466, 1467-69 (Fed. Cir. 1997), affirming that an assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes a RIF demotion even when the employee voluntarily applies for or is offered an assignment to that position, as long as the assignment was made after the agency informed the employee that his original position was abolished and that he was not selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of an agency-wide reorganization in 1992-1993, the agency reassigned Mr. Harants, a preference-eligible employee, from the position of Director, City Operations, PCES-01, in Cleveland, Ohio to the position of Postmaster, EAS-24, in Lansing, Michigan. Even though this placed Mr. Harants in a lower-grade position, the agency provided him with indefinite saved grade and indefinite saved pay. The agency similarly downgraded nearly 7,100 employees. However, in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 307 (1994), and <span class="Italic">White v. United States Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 299 (1994), the Board found that the agency should have used RIF procedures to effect its reorganization, and that the agency's placement of preference-eligible employees into lower grade positions, even with saved grade and pay, constituted appealable RIF demotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 26, 1994, Mr. Harants filed an appeal challenging the agency's action and seeking reinstatement. In that case, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> and ordered the agency to cancel the demotion action and to retroactively restore Mr. Harants to his former position. <span class="Italic">See Harants v. United States Postal Service</span>, No. CH-0351-94-0893-I-1, slip op. at 4 (MSPB Mar. 17, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Meanwhile, other downgraded employees had petitioned the Board for enforcement of orders like those granted in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> and to Mr. Harants. In <span class="Italic">Sink v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 628 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Unhoch v. United States Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 651 (1995), the Board stayed enforcement of all such final orders until April 18, 1995. By this date, the Board required the agency to cancel the demotions and either reinstate such employees to their former positions or issue them specific "compliance" RIF notices. In August 1994, the agency set up a task force to comply with the Board's order. The task force established competitive areas for its operations, competitive levels for its employees, and followed other RIF-required procedures to effect a "compliance RIF" based on the agency's organizational structure immediately prior to the 1992-1993 reorganization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency sent Mr. Harants a specific RIF notice dated April 17, 1995. It explained that "effective July 8, 1995, you will be released from the Competitive Level you occupied prior to the 1992-1993 reorganization." In accordance with RIF procedures, the notice stated that Mr. Harants would be reassigned to his "best offer of placement," an EAS-24 position as a manager in Cleveland, also with saved grade and saved pay. However, the notice provided Mr. Harants with the option of declining the "best offer" and remaining in his current position in Lansing, Michigan.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that Mr. Harants declined the "best offer" on May 19, 1995. The record also shows that subsequently, on July 5, 1995, the agency retroactively cancelled Mr. Harants' 1993 demotion. On July 13, 1995, the agency processed his "reassignment" to Lansing, effective July 8, 1995. On August 5, 1995, Mr. Harants filed this appeal, claiming that his "reassignment" constituted a RIF demotion, and that under the RIF regulations, his "best offer of placement" had been determined incorrectly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge had conducted a hearing and reversed the agency's action, the parties appealed to the Board, which <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The Board deferred to its recent decision in <span class="Italic">Tomasello v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 73 MSPR 640 (1997), a case with nearly identical facts. In <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span>, the Board noted that a RIF demotion requires that the employee be "released from his or her competitive level." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 643. The Board in <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span> reasoned that an agency employee who accepted a reassignment, however, was never released from his competitive level (as scheduled for July 8, 1995) because he accepted a reassignment instead. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because Mr. Harants accepted a reassignment before July 8, 1995, the Board ruled that <span class="Italic">Tomasello</span> governed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction in RIF actions is based on 5 CFR 351.901. This section states: "An employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted by a reduction in force action may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." The regulations further define "demotion" as "a change of an employee, while serving continuously within the same agency...(i) [t]o a lower grade or (ii) [t]o a position with a lower rate of pay when both the old and the new positions...are in different pay method categories." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4) (1995). In this case, the agency has demoted Mr. Harants within the meaning of the regulation<span class="Italic">. See Brown v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 345 (1993). The question is whether the demotion was effected "by a reduction in force action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, this court undertakes to summarize what is not at issue in this case. First, there is no question that Mr. Harants' original reassignment in 1993 was a RIF demotion, over which the Board had jurisdiction. In fact, the Board exercised that jurisdiction in ordering the agency to restore him to his previous PCES-01 position. However, the Board has ruled that the agency complied with all orders of this kind by undergoing its "compliance RIF" (i.e., by canceling Mr. Harants' reassignment and issuing him a specific RIF notice). <span class="Italic">See Sink v. United States Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 497 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also without question that if Mr. Harants had voluntarily chosen to go to Lansing before the agency took any action in 1993, the Board would have had no jurisdiction over either of his appeals. <span class="Italic">See Torain v. United States Postal Service</span>, 83 F.3d 1420, 1422-23 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that no appeal rights accrue when an employee voluntarily accepts another agency position before the agency takes any appealable action). It also follows that if Mr. Harants had voluntarily chosen to stay in Lansing before he received the April 17, 1995 notice, the Board would have lacked jurisdiction. On the other hand, if Mr. Harants had not declined the "best offer" and thereby accepted it for the time being, the Board would have clearly had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1422 ("A preference-eligible employee of the USPS who has been demoted by a reduction-in-force is entitled to appeal that decision to the MSPB.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's precedent, an assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes a RIF demotion even when the employee voluntarily applies <span id="Page_3035"></span>for or is offered an assignment to that position, as long as the assignment was made after the agency had informed the employee that his original position had been abolished and that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. <span class="Italic">See Hanson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 413, 417 (1993) (applied for assignment); Brown, 58 MSPR at 351 (agency offered assignment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Harants voluntarily accepted an offer for an assignment to a lower-grade position after he had been informed that his original position had been abolished and that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. This court sees no principled distinction between the situation in Brown and the situations in this case and Tomasello. Moreover, this court specifically endorses the holding in Brown. Accordingly, this court holds that Mr. Harants' assignment to the Lansing EAS-24 position, even though voluntary, was a RIF demotion and the Board has jurisdiction to hear Mr. Harants' appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board based its decision on a finding that Mr. Harants had never been released from his competitive level. It is true that a RIF demotion requires an employee to be released from his or her competitive level. However, a release from one's competitive level can result from an assignment other than to one's "best offer of placement." Mr. Harants was released from his competitive level when he was "reassigned" to the Lansing EAS-24 position effective July 8, 1995. The following passage from Brown is illuminating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Because the position to which the agency assigned the appellant is at a grade level different from that of his former position, and because positions may not be included in the same competitive level unless they are all at the same grade, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR 351.403(a), we find that the appellant was released from his competitive level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 58 MSPR at 348. Similarly, Mr. Harants was released from his competitive level because the position to which the agency assigned him was at a grade level different from that of his former position. The assignment therefore constituted a release from his competitive level.</p>
