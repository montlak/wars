<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-210"><span class="space">d.</span> Employee May Be Terminated or Will Resign or Retire on Specified Condition; Agreement Not to Reapply</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Last chance agreements generally involve settlements that link terminations of employees to waiver of appeal rights upon the occurrence of specified conditions. Violations of these agreements that result in the removal of an employee generally are treated through new appeals rather than through enforcement petitions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sawaya v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 54 MSPR 311, 314 (1992). [Refer to last chance agreements in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-160.html#sec2-158">Waiver of Appeal Through Last Chance or Other Preappeal Agreement</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies may negotiate settlements that do not waive appeal rights if the employee is terminated pursuant to the settlement. Unless the right to appeal is waived, the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal resulting from the agency's termination of the appellant under the agreement, and the agency then has to prove that the termination satisfies the statutory requirement that the termination promote service efficiency. The employee may lodge affirmative defenses, e.g., mitigation and harmful error. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 270, 279-82 (1996), noted that a condition of good faith is implied in an agreement that permits an employee to be removed under specific conditions. <span class="Italic">Coleman</span> distinguished a "last chance" agreement from an agreement that does not waive appeal rights, but permits adverse action against an employee under specific circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided that "[i]t is understood and agreed by the Appellant and his Representative that a failure to comply with any of the parts of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement by the Appellant may be just cause for the [agency] to remove the Appellant from its employment rolls." There is nothing in this provision that limits the agency to removing the appellant from its employment rolls only if he "materially" failed to comply with the agreement. The fact that a failure to comply with "any of the parts of the provisions" of the agreement may be just cause for the appellant's removal suggests that the parties agreed that any breach, whether material or not, could result in his removal. Therefore, this argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's allegation that the agency acted in bad faith, the Board has defined bad faith as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The opposite of "good faith," generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive. Term "bad faith" is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; it is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Silva v. US Postal Service</span>, 59 MSPR 268, 272 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 323 n.6 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency based its removal action in part on the appellant's discharge from a prescribed VA inpatient treatment program, which we have found constituted a breach of the settlement agreement. Although the appellant was enrolled in another treatment program when the agency proposed his removal, its removal action based on his prior breach does not constitute bringing the charge in bad faith. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Silva</span>, 59 MSPR at 272 (where the agency based a perjury charge on a statement by the appellant that the agency had reason to believe was false, and where the administrative judge reversed the charge because she found that the statement was not material, the agency's error did not rise to the level of bringing the charge in bad faith). The appellant has not shown that the agency neglected or refused to perform a duty under the settlement agreement, and that any such neglect or refusal was based on an interested or sinister motive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he settlement agreement provided that a failure to comply with any of the parts of the provisions of the settlement agreement "may be just cause for the [agency] to remove the Appellant from its employment rolls." In an affidavit, the appellant's representative averred that, at his request, the agency agreed to substitute the word "may" for the word "will" in the above provision. Such evidence is not barred by the parole evidence rule because "negotiations prior to or contemporaneous with the adoption of a writing are admissible in evidence to establish...the meaning of a writing." Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 214(c) (1979). The appellant asserted that the language of this provision merely meant that he agreed to be bound by an additional agency rule that, depending on the circumstances, might be just cause for his removal if he violated it. Thus, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should have determined the reasonableness of the penalty and considered evidence of his completion of a rehabilitation program as a mitigating factor. The agency asserted below that the appellant "agreed" to the penalty of removal if he failed to comply with the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All that the parties agreed to here was that a failure to comply with the settlement agreement by the appellant "may" be just cause for the agency to remove him from the agency's employment rolls. Implicit in the use of the term "may" is that a failure to comply with the settlement agreement also "may not" be just cause for the appellant's removal. The settlement agreement does not provide that the agency has sole unreviewable discretion on the issue of whether a particular breach constitutes just cause for the appellant's removal, and does not otherwise limit the Board's scope of review of a removal action based on an alleged breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Riese</span>, 37 MSPR at 367 (a provision in a last-chance agreement that "failure to abide by Postal rules and regulations will result in removal" did not limit the Board's scope of review of a subsequent removal action). We will not interpret the settlement agreement in a way that unilaterally modifies the agreement's material terms, or imply a waiver term into this unambiguous settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Womack v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 213, 216 (1994); <span class="Italic">Mobley v. US Postal Service</span>, 55 MSPR 467, 474 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The waiver of a statutory right, to be enforceable, must constitute the "informed, intentional abandonment of a known right." <span class="Italic">Ferby v. US Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 455 (1985). Although the settlement agreement provides that a failure to comply with the terms of the agreement "may" be just cause for the agency to remove the appellant from its rolls, it does not waive the appellant's right under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513 to have the agency prove before the Board that its action was taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," nor does it waive his right to have the Board review the agency's selected penalty.... There is no mention within the agreement that the parties considered it to be a "last chance" agreement or intended it to function as a "last chance" agreement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Montoya v. US Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 318-19 (1989). Thus, there is nothing within the agreement's provisions that even implies that the appellant made an informed, intentional decision to abandon his statutory rights before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, therefore, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant an opportunity to submit evidence and argument on the issues of nexus and penalty, and shall adjudicate these issues in light of our finding that one of the specifications has not been sustained, and in light of the mitigating circumstances surrounding the sustained specification....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">McClain v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 66, 70 (1989), coming to the Board on the agency's enforcement petition, the appellant's settlement agreement called for him to submit a resignation to the agency.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hopkins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 266, 267-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-10 (1999), involved the appellant's efforts to enforce a settlement that provided him employment and promotional benefits in exchange for his agreement to retire from the agency. It appears that the settlement called for the appellant to retire when he was first eligible, but if he had done so, he would have been required to make a substantial deposit to the retirement fund for past military service. Appellant lacked the funds for the deposit, and he did not retire. The agency did not <span id="Page_5089"></span>honor provisions of the agreement and sought to recover from the appellant some benefits paid to him under the agreement. Although the problem with the redeposit may, properly characterized, have been a unilateral or mutual mistake (meaning that the appellant would have been in breach of the agreement or the agreement would have been rescinded), the Board instead decided that the appellant complied with the agreement because, although it may have implicitly, it did not explicitly require the employee to make the deposit for past military service to qualify the appellant for the first available retirement date:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant was to remain in the WG-6 position to which he had been demoted through January 31, 1998, and effective February 1, 1998, the agency was to place him in a WG-8 position. It also provided that the appellant was to submit a request for retirement effective the first date on which the appellant was eligible to retire. Failure to submit a timely retirement request relieved the agency of any and all other obligations under the settlement agreement. The agreement stated further that, if the appellant at any time rescinded or retracted his request to retire, the agency was released from all obligations under the agreement and the appellant would be placed in a WG-6 position. Furthermore, the agreement stated that, in the event the appellant withdrew or rescinded his retirement request after entering the WG-8 position, he would be liable for paying the agency the pay differential between the WG-6 and WG-8 rates for any period of time that he was in the WG-8 position. On November 18, 1997, the appellant signed an "Application for Immediate Retirement." The copy of this application provided by the agency contains a "separation" date of August 31, 1998. On July 9, 1998, the agency notified the appellant in writing that to retire by August 31, 1998, he had to submit final paperwork by July 17, 1998. In a letter dated July 29, 1998, the agency informed the appellant that because of his failure to complete the final paperwork for retirement, his promotion to the WG-8 position was being canceled and he was being returned to a WG-6 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued that he was able to retire in August 1998 only if he made a deposit for his military service, waived his military retirement pay, and combined his military and civilian service to receive a civil service retirement annuity. He claims that otherwise he is not eligible to retire until June 2000. The appellant contended that he would be disadvantaged by combining his military and civilian service and that he cannot be considered eligible to retire until June 2000. Thus, he argued that the agency breached the settlement agreement when it canceled his promotion to the WG-8 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the plain terms of the settlement agreement established that the appellant had agreed to retire on the first date that he was eligible and that because he was eligible on August 31, 1998, the agency did not breach the agreement when it canceled his promotion. The AJ found further that, even if the terms were found ambiguous, the extrinsic evidence established that the intent was for the appellant to retire in August 1998. Accordingly, the AJ found that the appellant did not establish that the agency breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on petition for review that he did not breach the settlement agreement because under the agreement he is not required to retire until June 3, 2000, and that he would like to be able to retire at that time as agreed. At the time of the settlement agreement the appellant was 58 years old, with just over 17 years of civilian service, as well as 20 years of military service for which he had not made a deposit to gain CSRS retirement credit. If the appellant had made a $19,000 deposit for his military service he could have retired effective May 20, 1994, since as of that date he would have been 55 years old with over 30 years of service. Without that deposit, however, the earliest the appellant could retire would be June 3, 2000, when he would have the requisite 20 years of service and have attained 60 years of age. The appellant did not make the deposit because he was unable to secure the necessary funds. Thus, as of August 31, 1998, the appellant was not eligible to retire because he had not made a deposit for his military service. However, because the settlement agreement does not contain any express promise by the appellant to make a deposit for his military service, the appellant did not breach the agreement and is entitled to have it enforced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, because the settlement agreement specifically states: "[t]his Agreement is a full and exclusive statement of settlement terms.... The Appellant and the [agency] agree that neither party is bound by any representation, promise, or inducement not set forth in this Agreement[,]" the parties are not bound by any promises or representations not included in the agreement itself. Thus, we find that the AJ erred in finding that the agreement included an implied promise by the appellant to make a deposit for his military service. <span class="Italic">See Putnam v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 44 MSPR 533, 535 (1990) (the Board should not read into a settlement agreement terms that the parties did not include).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, we find that even if the agreement can be interpreted as imposing a good-faith obligation on the appellant to take necessary steps to become eligible to retire at the earliest possible date, there is no indication that he has breached this obligation because under the undisputed facts he does not have and cannot obtain $19,000 to make the deposit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the clause in the settlement agreement obligating the appellant to repay a portion of the WG-8 wage already lawfully earned in the event of a breach appears to be unenforceable. However, we need not resolve that issue because the appellant did not breach the agreement and is not asking for the agreement to be invalidated. Notwithstanding, we find that the agency must reimburse the appellant for any sums that it has collected from him under this clause, since the agency did not have a valid reason for demoting him to the WG-6 position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Venturing down the path of mutual mistake, the Board set aside a settlement agreement that called for appellant's retirement in <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 277, 281-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15 (1999). The agreement was a nullity because both sides assumed appellant was eligible to retire, when he was not:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity either by fraud practiced upon a party or by mutual mistake under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 45 MSPR 263, 266 (1990). One who attacks a settlement agreement bears the burden of showing fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. Asberry v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). A mistake of fact is material if it involves a "basic assumption" underlying an agreement. <span class="Italic">As'Salaam</span>, 65 MSPR at 421. A settlement term is material where it is central to the agreement and numerous other provisions of the agreement are dependent upon it. <span class="Italic">Miller,</span> 45 MSPR at 268.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the relevant contract provision simply provides that the appellant will be placed in a leave without pay status from January 22, 1998, until the date that he is eligible to retire from federal service. The provision, however, does not specify a date when the appellant would be eligible to retire. Nor does it identify the specific retirement category under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336 that would apply to the appellant's retirement. Furthermore, the settlement provision does not limit the period of time that the agency will carry the appellant in a leave without pay status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued below that he understood that under the settlement agreement the agency was going to place him in a leave without pay status for 6 months, at which point he would have 25 years of service. He argued further that he understood that the agency would cancel the removal action, abolish his former position retroactively to November 7, 1997, and "involuntarily separate" him from federal service, thereby allowing him to qualify for a discontinued service retirement annuity under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d). The agency argued that it understood that under the settlement agreement the appellant would be carried in a leave without pay status for 6 months, and that, at the end of that time period, he would meet the age and length of service requirements for an immediate, regular retirement. The agency claimed that, when the appellant submitted his retirement application, it was discovered that he did not meet the age requirements of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(a) or (b), and thus he was ineligible for retirement. The agency argued further that it was not obligated under the settlement agreement to retroactively abolish the appellant's former position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant clearly did not meet the age requirement for an immediate annuity at the time of the settlement agreement, i.e., the appellant was 45 years old with 25 years of service and an immediate retirement requires 55 years of age with 30 years of service or 60 years of age with 20 years of service, there is nothing in the record to support the appellant's understanding that the agency had agreed to abolish his position so that he would be eligible for a discontinued service retirement annuity. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336. In the absence of any specific reference to the retirement category under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336 that would apply to the appellant, we will not presume the agreement provided for a discontinued service annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, there is nothing in the agreement that suggests that the parties intended the illogical result that the appellant would be placed into an indefinite leave without pay status until he was eligible for an immediate retirement, which was at the minimum approximately 10 years into the future. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336. Interpretations of settlement agreements that create absurd results are disfavored. <span class="Italic">Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 MSPR 652, 656 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The retirement provision is clearly material to the agreement and was relied upon by the parties before the Board. However, both parties indicated that they were caught unaware that the appellant did not meet the full retirement eligibility age and service formula. Under these circumstances, where the parties to an agreement were mutually mistaken as to the lawfulness of a material provision, the Board will set aside the agreement....</p>
