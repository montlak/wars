<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-120"><span class="space">2.</span> Polls; General Inquiries; Questionnaires</h4>
<p class="noindent">Unless there is agreement to the procedure by the union, management unlawfully bypasses the exclusive representative in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) if it polls employees concerning their opinions about a proposed change in working conditions. The poll goes beyond permissible efforts to obtain information about agency operations. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 3512</span>, 28 FLRA 409, 430 (1987) (ALJ Decision). Whether a management poll of employees as to their morale constitutes a formal discussion without notice to the union in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8), or an attempt to bypass the union in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5), was considered in <span class="Italic">Kaiserslautern Am. High Sch., DODDS and Overseas Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 9 FLRA 184, 186-87 (1982). The employer's poll apparently followed a union poll directed to the same issue: possible difficulties in obtaining accreditation of the school for, among other reasons, poor morale. FLRA concluded that the employer's poll did not constitute an attempt to bypass the union. There was nothing improper about gathering information to permit the school to overcome an evaluation report affecting its accreditation. Not all direct communication between management and employees is prohibited. The poll was conducted in a manner that did not threaten or promise benefits to employees or otherwise bypass the union. The poll was not a formal discussion entitling the union to be represented. The poll was not a discussion; rather, it was considered an "information gathering procedure" relating to an accreditation procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent">The limitations on polling, and management's freedom to poll without union involvement, were summarized in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 972, 977-78 (2010), reviewing an arbitrator's award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that agencies unlawfully bypass an exclusive representative when they communicate directly with bargaining-unit employees concerning grievances, disciplinary actions, and other matters relating to the collective-bargaining relationship. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Elkton, Ohio</span>, 63 FLRA 280, 282 (2009). Such conduct constitutes direct dealing with an employee, and violates &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute, because it interferes with the union's rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) of the Statute to act for and represent all employees in the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Such conduct also constitutes an independent violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute because it demeans the union and inherently interferes with the rights of employees to designate and rely on the union for representation. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the prohibition on management's negotiating or dealing directly with unit employees does not in every case prevent an agency from seeking information or opinions directly from its employees. <span class="Italic">See IRS (Dist., Region, Nat'l Office Units)</span>, 19 FLRA 353, 354 (1985) (<span class="Italic">IRS Dist.</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 826 F.2d 114 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Thus, as part of its overall management responsibility to conduct operations in an effective and efficient manner, an agency may question employees directly, provided that it does not do so in a way that amounts to attempting to negotiate directly with them concerning matters that are properly bargainable with their exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>In this connection, management must have the latitude to gather information, including opinions, from unit employees to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether polling of employees violates the Statute, the Authority considers the nature of the information sought, the manner in which the poll was conducted, how the information was used, and similar relevant factors. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C. &#x0026; IRS Indianapolis, Ind. Dist. Office</span>, 31 FLRA 832, 838 (1988). The Authority has found no bypass where, for example, there was no evidence that a respondent: (1) attempted to deal or negotiate directly with unit employees concerning their conditions of employment, or in any manner created the appearance of doing so, when it solicited information, s<span class="Italic">ee IRS Dist.</span>, 19 FLRA at 355; or (2) intended to or did use the information gained from employees in a way that would undermine the status of the exclusive representative, <span class="Italic">see DOD, Office of Dependents Schs.</span>, 19 FLRA 762, 764 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 826 F.2d 114 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1341"></span>To support its bypass argument, the Union cites the instructions that the Agency gave to managers, in which the Agency stated that, during the survey meetings, managers could "discuss with the group the pros and cons of certain actions or suggestions to determine the preferred method or approach, and you can support a suggestion[&#8197;]" that an employee puts forth. However, even assuming that following the instructions could constitute a bypass, the Arbitrator did not find that any managers actually followed the instructions. Instead, he found that, if there were any meetings in which management "crosse[d] the line[&#8197;]" with employees, then "they're not part of the record." Accordingly, the Arbitrator found that there was no evidence that management negotiated directly with unit employees during any of the meetings. The Union does not provide any basis for finding that the Arbitrator erred in this regard.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;In addition, we note that the instructions on which the Union relies expressly state that managers "cannot commit to implement a suggestion until you have completed any bargaining obligations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions cited by the Union are distinguishable.&#x2003;In some, the exceptions before the Authority did not involve bypass issues. <span class="Italic">See HHS Balt.</span>, 28 FLRA at 409; <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 14 FLRA at 579; <span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>, 3 FLRA 512, 512. In others, agencies had dealt directly with employees regarding grievances. <span class="Italic">See FCI Bastrop</span>, 51 FLRA at 1346-47; <span class="Italic">SSA Region X</span>, 39 FLRA at 311-13. Finally, some decisions involved situations where, unlike here, there was evidence that management either negotiated directly with employees or made changes (or indicated that they would make changes) based on employee suggestions. <span class="Italic">See IRS Kansas City</span>, 57 FLRA at 129-30 (agency negotiated directly with unit employees regarding seating arrangements); <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 42 FLRA at 1239 (agency approved and implemented unit employees' proposal); <span class="Italic">ATF</span>, 16 FLRA at 543 (agency representative asked employees how they wanted to handle a certain matter and stated, "It's whatever you decide.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A poll was a formal discussion requiring an opportunity for union presence in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 11 FLRA 69, 73 (1982). The interviews were initiated by management, were conducted by management officials with a number of unit employees, required attendance by those employees, followed a formal agenda, and concerned subject matter involving the employees' general conditions of employment. Interviews by management requiring employees to attend and answer questions concerning working conditions and their views of management practices constituted formal discussions. The union was entitled to be present at those discussions, involving many issues covered by the parties' negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PATCO</span>, 11 FLRA 36, 47 (1983) (ALJ Decision). The employer bypassed the union when its manager interviewed employees, without involving the exclusive representative, concerning their feelings about agency housing policy. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 2509</span>, 14 FLRA 578, 579 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reemphasized that the prohibition on management's negotiating or dealing directly with unit employees in derogation of its duty to bargain with a union does not always prevent an agency from seeking information or opinions directly from its employees. As part of its overall management responsibility to conduct operations efficiently, an agency may question employees directly, provided it does not do so in a way amounting to an attempt to negotiate directly with employees concerning matters properly bargainable with the union. Management could distribute a questionnaire to its employees to obtain information that would enhance its appeals operation. The union was told of the study in advance, advised that it would be informed of the results of the study, and provided information from the study necessary for negotiation of any resulting changes. The agency did not attempt to bypass the union. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 353, 354-55 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114, 117, 121-23 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>. A permissible questionnaire requested newly-hired employees to state if they felt their interviews were comprehensive, whether their preappointment instructions were clear, what type of assistance they received from the personnel office, how they rated the service of the personnelists, and the quality of discussions with their supervisors concerning job requirements. There was no attempt to negotiate working conditions with the employees; there was no bypass of the union. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 19 FLRA 762, 764 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114, 124 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>. If management meets with unit employees to disseminate or gather information and does not solicit or entertain proposals from unit employees concerning their conditions of employment, i.e., negotiate or deal directly with them, and does not otherwise attempt to undermine the status of the union, it does not improperly bypass the union. <span class="Italic">GSA, Region 8 and AFGE Local 3275</span>, 19 FLRA 20, 22-23 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management did not commit a ULP when it distributed questionnaires, without notice to the union, to elicit unit employees' opinions and information concerning an Employee Performance Appraisal System. The questionnaires were an information gathering mechanism connected with the management function of studying its operations. There was no indication that management attempted to deal or negotiate directly with employees concerning their conditions of employment. Management was not attempting to negotiate with unit employees concerning establishment of standards, but only seeking information as to how the existing standards were working. There was no obligation to bargain as to the questionnaire. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 1032, 1034 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114, 124 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>. A questionnaire distributed to employees without negotiations with the union was not improper when the questionnaire, to assist future management planning, requested employees, without attribution, to identify areas of potential fraud or mismanagement in agency operations. There was no showing that the union was improperly bypassed. There were no negotiations as to employment conditions. The employer did not intend to use and did not use information from the questionnaire to undermine the status of the union. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 20 FLRA 125, 126-27 (1985). A town hall meeting with employees by management to solicit opinions of employees on working conditions, particularly the hiring and employment of disabled employees, was not a bypass of the union when the union was put on notice of the meeting and had the opportunity to send an observer, and when no attempt was made to negotiate with the employees as to their working conditions. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 19 FLRA 415, 417 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The decisions in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 353 (1985), <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 1032 (1985), and <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 19 FLRA 762 (1985), were reviewed on appeal. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114, 122-24 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The court reviewed the salient facts. In <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> the agency notified the union that it was about to conduct a survey of its appeals organization using interviews and questionnaires for senior auditors and appeals auditors. Copies of the questionnaires were sent a week later to the union. The questionnaire sought the respondents' reactions to the increased use of computers, estimates of need for additional training, preferences for career ladder opportunities, and evaluations of the effectiveness of past training. The union responded by requesting the information developed from the surveys and by advising management that it should not interview employees other than those chosen by the union, and then only with a union representative present. The agency, in turn, declined to provide the data collected until management decided to change work practices; the agency also declined to permit the union to have representatives present during employee interviews, characterized by management as simply "an information gathering mechanism." In <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>, the agency sent questionnaires directly to employees without notifying their union. The questionnaires were mailed as part of an internal audit of the employee performance appraisal system. Employees were asked to state how they became aware of the appraisal system and what the employees thought of operation of the system. In <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, management sent questionnaires to employees seeking suggestions for improvements in personnel recruitment and processing practices.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing the statutory definition of collective bargaining at 5 USC 7102(2), the court determined in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 826 F.2d at 123-24, that collective bargaining consists of activity leading toward contracts or agreements concerning conditions of employment, but that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nowhere does the Act imply that a union's exclusive representation of employees at the bargaining table precludes direct communication between management and its employees for other purposes....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rights of unions under the Act must be interpreted in the context of the Act's parallel concerns for (1) the right of federal employees to exclusive representation by a union of their choice and (2) the advancement of governmental effectiveness and efficiency. That the second concern is not to be subordinated to the first is made absolutely clear by the command that the Act's provisions "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."...&#8197;Thus management has the dual obligation to bargain with its employees' exclusive representative in good faith <span class="Italic">and</span> to advance the public's interest in efficient government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It should be self-evident that achievement of the latter goal will at all times require reliable information and views only employees are in a position to give; and it stands to reason that the reliability of such information will not be enhanced by filtering through a third party such as a union. Thus there can be no basis for a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule of the kind NTEU would have us adopt. At the same time, a search for reliable information may not be used as a screen behind which to subvert a union's role as its members' exclusive collective bargaining representative. Therefore, the facts of these cases are to be examined in the light of the following guidance which is provided by the FLRA, and which we endorse:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]n agency may question employees directly provided that it does not do so in a way which amounts to attempting to negotiate directly with its employees concerning matters which are properly bargainable with its employees' exclusive representative. In this regard...management must have the latitude to gather information, including opinions, from unit employees to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">19 F.L.R.A. at 384. We now apply this guiding principle to the facts of the three cases before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Case-By-Case Analysis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Collective bargaining requires that <span class="Italic">during the course of negotiation</span> each bargaining party be represented by a single voice. Thus a key issue, <span id="Page_1342"></span>decided by the Authority in favor of the agency in each case, is whether the allegedly unfair labor practices occurred during the course of negotiation, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, during bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The IRS Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In looking closely at the factual setting of the IRS' alleged violation..., we think it significant that the IRS notified the union in advance of its intent to distribute the questionnaires, provided it with copies, and advised NTEU that should the IRS "determine that changes are necessary as a result of this study and such changes affect bargaining unit employees, you will be properly notified." Furthermore, if negotiations were to proceed, management undertook to provide the union "with any information from the study...which is necessary for negotiation." As evidenced by this notification and assurance, the agency clearly recognized its statutory obligation to negotiate with the union should the agency contemplate any changes in work conditions. Because of these indicia of good faith, and because we find no indications in the record that suggest IRS trespassed on NTEU's statutory prerogatives, we find no basis for concluding that the IRS has committed an unfair labor practice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Customs Service Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike the IRS, the Customs Service did not notify the union beforehand of its intent to distribute a questionnaire to its employees. While the questionnaire was addressed to a recently negotiated and implemented performance appraisal system, we find nothing in the questions asked to suggest an attempt to negotiate directly with the employees over the newly adopted system or over any other matter concerning conditions of employment. To the contrary, the questions are completely consistent with a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> attempt by management to determine how the new appraisal system is working. The FLRA reasonably concluded that the direct solicitation of information in this case was an appropriate exercise of the agency's responsibility to see that its affairs are conducted in an effective and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">DODDS Complaint</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find this a more difficult case than the prior two solely because negotiations scheduled to begin in the near future would be dealing, in part, with matters that were the subject of the questionnaire circulated by DODDS to its employees. We note at the outset that the ALJ found no problem with the questionnaire itself. Rather, he based his finding that the DODDS had committed unfair labor practices entirely on the language in the covering memorandum in which the agency expressed its hope that employees "will not hesitate to give us the benefit of any suggestions for improvements."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On reviewing the record, we find no indication that the solicitation of "suggestions for improvement" was intended to be, or in fact constituted, an attempt "to negotiate directly with [DODDS] employees concerning matters which are properly bargainable with its employees' exclusive representative." The fact that the agency assured employees that information received from the survey would not be discussed with any "regional director, personnel official, or finance official" suggests the absence of any hidden purpose. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that DODDS actually negotiated with any unit employees concerning their conditions of employment. The "solicitation" in the covering memorandum could reasonably be interpreted as an assurance that the questionnaire was designed as a management tool to evaluate the agency's recruitment and appointment process....</p>
<p class="noindent">Interpreting <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 31 FLRA 832, 837-38 (1988), FLRA dismissed a bypass complaint resulting from a poll of employees concerning their interest in working at a new office that was being opened:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Respondent gave the Union notice of its intent to open the new office and to poll unit employees, and explained the limited purpose of the poll to the Union. In response to the Respondent's request for the Union's comments or suggestions, the Union did not object to or even mention the intended polling. The poll was then conducted and limited to a simple inquiry as to individual employees' interest in working at the new location. There is no evidence that the Respondent gave the employees any indication that an expression of intent would result in reassignment or that the Respondent discussed the matter with or attempted to persuade employees. The Respondent did not seek the employees' opinions as to the manner in which employees should be chosen for reassignment. The Respondent shared the results of the poll with the Union, indicated that it was open to negotiate on matters concerning the new office, and negotiated with the Union before the office was opened.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, these circumstances are "indicia of good faith," similar to those noted by the court in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>...which demonstrate the Respondent's recognition of its statutory obligation to negotiate with the Union....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In order to determine whether a polling of employees violates the Statute, consideration will be given to the nature of the information sought by a poll, the manner in which the poll is conducted, how the information is used, and similar relevant factors....&#8197;[W]e note particularly that the Respondent advised the Union of the intended polling and requested its comments and suggestions, and the Union did not raise any objection before the polling occurred even though it had the opportunity to do so.</p>
