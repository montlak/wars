<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-110"><span class="space">H.</span> DAMAGES; REGULATION GOVERNING RECOVERY</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Compensatory damages are available under the 1991 Civil Rights Act. Consequential damages and compensatory damages are authorized by the amended Whistleblower Protection Act and the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, 5 USC 1214(g)(2) and 1221(g)1)(A)(ii). VEOA provides for liquidated damages. Other than through those statutes, damages are not awarded in Board litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Redice v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 312, 316 &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Vitanza v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 385 (2003) (denying damages claim when the Board decision affirmed an initial decision sustaining charges but mitigated the penalty). There is little law on consequential damages, and the legislative history defining them is scant. Compensatory damages, however, have generated a volume of claims and decisions in the courts and, for the federal sector, in the EEOC. The Board issued regulations governing damages claims and a few decisions on compensatory damages that generally follow the lead of the EEOC federal sector decisions. Refer to IRS Revenue Ruling 96-65 [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-121.html#sec16-119">Taxation of Damages, Attorney Fees</a>"] for information about taxation of awards of compensatory damages. Discussed here are requests for statutory awards of damages or requests for punitive damages arising out of MSPB cases. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-214.html#sec16-212">Agreement to Provide Affirmative, Neutral, or Controlled Reference</a>" for requests for damages arising out of violations of settlement agreements; refer to Davis and Hadley's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law and Practice (</span><a href="https://deweypub.com/eeoguide">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023) and to Gilbert and Sumner's <span class="Italic">Compensatory Damages and Other Remedies in Federal Sector Employment Discrimination Cases</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/22CDOR.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board regulations governing claims for compensatory and consequential damages are at Subpart H of 5 CFR Part 1201 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.201&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statement of purpose</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;This subpart governs Board proceedings for awards of...consequential damages, compensatory damages, and liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An award of consequential damages is authorized in only two situations: Where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under 5 U.S.C. 1221, and where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1214. Consequential damages include such items as medical costs and travel expenses, and other costs as determined by the Board through case law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 1981a) authorizes an award of compensatory damages to a prevailing party who is found to have been intentionally discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C. 1221(g)) also authorizes an award of compensatory damages in cases where the Board orders corrective action. Compensatory damages include pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and nonpecuniary losses, such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;An award equal to back pay shall be awarded as liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. 3330c when the Board or a court determines an agency willfully violated an appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.202&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority for awards</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>

The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C. 1221(g)) also authorizes an award of compensatory damages in cases where the Board orders corrective action.

<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time for Making Request</span>. A request should be made as early as possible in the proceeding on the merits, no later than the conferences held to define the issues in the case, subject to the AJ's authority to waive untimeliness for good cause shown. The Board may also waive the time limit for good cause shown when a request is made for the first time on PFR of a merits decision. In such a case, or where there has been no prior proceeding before an AJ, it may send the case to an AJ for adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(a), (h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Merits Proceeding or Addendum Proceeding</span>. Because AJs may waive the application of any Board regulation not required by law, the AJ or the Board may consider and rule on the request in the decision on the merits, if such action is in the interest of the parties and will promote efficiency and economy in adjudication. Normally, however, the AJ or the Board will defer a decision on the request for an addendum proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(d), (h)(1).</p>

If the AJ defers a decision on a request for consequential, liquidated, or compensatory damages for an addendum proceeding as described above in section 6b, the AJ will schedule the proceeding after issuance of an initial decision that becomes final or a final Board decision. It is within the AJ's discretion to allow discovery during the processing of the damages proceeding (although, as noted above, there is a right to appropriate discovery in a compliance proceeding).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hearing</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Settlement</span>. The Board's policy is to encourage the settlement of disputes involving legal damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. The Board has addressed the limits of its authority regarding requests for damages under certain circumstances. For compensatory damages, the Board's earliest and still lead decision is<span class="Italic"> Markiewicz-Sloan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 58 (1997), which sets the basic rules applicable to such appeals; <span class="Italic">Calhoon v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 375 (2001) (compensatory damages are not available for disparate impact discrimination); <span class="Italic">Simonton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 189 (2000) (compensatory damages are not available for age discrimination or EEO-based retaliation); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 580 (1999) (compensatory damages are not available for a PFE of a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 149 (1999) (compensatory damages may not be awarded for disability discrimination based on the failure to accommodate if the agency has made good faith efforts to accommodate, but they are available for perceived discrimination because the appellant needs no accommodation). <span class="Italic">See also Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 115, 121-22 (1997) (neither compensatory damages nor back pay can be awarded in cases in which a finding of mixed-motive discrimination has been made and the agency has established that it would have taken the same action absent the discriminatory motive); <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Department of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 389, 392-93, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (in mixed-motive cases, if the agency proves that it would have taken the same action in the absence of unlawful discrimination or reprisal, the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement or back pay). The Board's more recent decision in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 48-51 (2015), suggests the same result would obtain under the revised analysis of discrimination claims it establishes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An amount equal to back pay shall be awarded as liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c of VEOA when the Board or a court determines that an agency willfully violated an appellant's veterans' preference rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.201(e) &#x0026; 1201.202(d). A violation is "willful" if the agency either knew or showed reckless disregard for the matter of whether its conduct was prohibited by VEOA. <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6; 8 (2007). An award of liquidated damages, therefore, may be made only if there is an entitlement to an award of back pay, and "in calculating damages, <span id="Page_4926"></span>the AJ "will make findings regarding several outstanding issues, including when, if at all, the appellant would have been entitled to grade, step and/or pay increases after the retroactive starting date. The [AJ] shall also instruct the appellant to provide records of his income, if any, and his efforts to obtain other employment during the relevant time period, as well as proof of any relevant expenses that should be offset in an award of lost wages or benefits." <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 18 (2011). Note, however, that "lost wages or benefits" has since been interpreted to mean lost wages <span class="Italic">and</span> benefits. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 171, &#x00B6; 14 (2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As for consequential damages, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (nonpecuniary damages, such as for pain and suffering, may not be awarded under the WPA and instead are limited to out-of-pocket costs); <span class="Italic">Reams v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447 (2002) (consequential damages do not extend to reimbursing the appellant for annual leave he or she used in prosecuting the appeal under the WPA); <span class="Italic">Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609 (2001) (consequential damages include not just medical expenses that the appellant has already incurred, but also future medical expenses that can be proven with reasonable certainty). For a review of several types of losses that may or may not be awarded as consequential damages, <span class="Italic">see King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14 (2015).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The motion for an award of damages is made after the Board's final decision on the merits, assuming an underlying request for damages during the adjudication leading to the final decision, <span class="Italic">Moore v. VA</span>, DA-1221-13-0213-B-1 (NP 4/12/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(e)(1), "[a] proceeding on the merits is a proceeding to decide an appeal of an agency action," that is, to determine whether the appellant should be restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Department of the Interior</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 238, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). <span class="Italic">Status quo ante</span> relief requires, in most instances, restoring the appellant to the position she occupied prior to the removal action or placing her in a position that is substantially equivalent. <span class="Italic">Gorny v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 520, &#x00B6; 6 (2011); <span class="Italic">see Gilbert</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 238, &#x00B6; 5 (explaining that an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal is entitled to cancellation of the retaliatory personnel action, reinstatement to his former position or a substantially equivalent position, back pay, interest on back pay, and other employment benefits he would have received had the action not occurred).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, an appellant who prevails on an allegation of reprisal for whistleblowing is entitled to relief that exceeds <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, including consequential damages. <span class="Italic">Samble v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). Consequential damages are medical costs, travel expenses and analogous reasonable and foreseeable out-of-pocket expenses or monetary losses that are causally connected to the whistleblowing reprisal at issue. <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 28 (2013). While a "request for consequential...damages must be made during the proceeding on the merits," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(a)(1), a distinct and separate addendum proceeding is commenced to adjudicate such a request upon a prevailing appellant's filing of a motion to that effect, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 17, 58 (2011); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(d)(1)-(e)(1).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Consistent with section 1201.204(d)(1), it has been the Board's practice to bifurcate prevailing appellants' requests for consequential damages for adjudication in addendum proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Johnston v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 12 (2005); <span class="Italic">Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 2 (2003); <span class="Italic">Carson v. Department of Energy</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 14-15 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F. App'x 234 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a motion, however, cannot be filed, and no addendum proceeding may commence, until the issuance of the final decision in a proceeding on the merits. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.202(e)(2), 1201.204(e)(1). Generally, the final decision in the proceeding on the merits may be an initial decision issued by an administrative judge that becomes final when the Board denies all petitions for review or because of a mere passage of time if no party petitions for review or requests to vacate the initial decision to accept a settlement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(a)-(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge (1) directed the agency to restore the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in the remand initial decision issued in the proceeding on the merits, and (2) advised the appellant that she could seek attorney fees and consequential damages by commencing addendum proceedings. Had the appellant not filed her petition for review, the remand initial decision would have become the Board's final decision upon the passage of 35 days after its issuance, given that the agency elected not to seek review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(a). However, because the appellant filed a petition for review, the remand initial decision cannot become final until the petition for review is adjudicated. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(a)-(b). Thus, any addendum proceeding as to the appellant's request for damages is premature. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of prematurity of any addendum proceeding, the administrative judge properly declined to adjudicate the appellant's request for consequential damages until the proceeding on the merits became final. Accordingly, we discern no basis to disturb the remand initial decision and deny the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">King v. USDA</span>, AT-0752-18-0079-I-1 (NP 10/20/2022) (Board does not seem strictly to enforce a regulatory provision that a request for compensatory damages be made no later than a prehearing conference), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scovitch v. NARA</span>, DC-3443-15-1049-P-1 (NP 9/2/2016), summarizes Board authority to award damages:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An award of consequential damages is only authorized under two circumstances: (1) when the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221; or (2) when the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Seibel v.

A Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 is not at issue here, and the Board did not order corrective action in the appellant's IRA appeal, but instead, dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was not entitled to an award of consequential damages. <span class="Italic">See Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 45 (2008) (finding that the Board could not address a claim for consequential damages before it ordered corrective action in an IRA appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may recover compensatory damages when: (1) the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214; or (2) in a whistleblower appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 in which the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465, applies. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.201(d), 1201.202(c); <span class="Italic">see King v.

As discussed previously, a Special Counsel complaint is not at issue, and, even assuming that the WPEA applied to the appellant's IRA appeal, the Board did not order corrective action in that appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant also may recover compensatory damages if he prevails in a Board appeal based on a finding of intentional discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a finding that the agency failed to make a reasonable accommodation for a qualified disabled person, or a finding of illegal retaliation for the appellant's protected equal employment opportunity activity. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 16 (2009); <span class="Italic"><span class="blue">Seibel</span></span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 15; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.201(d), 202(c)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The request for damages may be made after a finding of discrimination; it need not be made in the initial appeal--at least that is the analysis suggested by <span class="Italic">Watkins v. TVA</span>, AT-0752-18-0398-P-1 (NP 4/26/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we address the agency's argument in its cross petition for review that the administrative judge was without jurisdiction to decide the appellant's motion for compensatory damages because the appellant failed to raise his damages claim during the merits stage of these proceedings....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency appears to conflate jurisdiction with the Board's procedures for awarding compensatory damages. The Board's regulations recognize the statutory authority to award compensatory damages separate and apart from its procedural and substantive requirements. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(c) (providing for awards of compensatory damages as authorized by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981a) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204 (addressing the procedure for seeking compensatory damages). The agency's argument goes to the appellant's failure to comply with the procedural requirements; it does not concern our well-established jurisdiction to decide the appellant's motion for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See Heffernan</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 5. Accordingly, we deny the agency's cross petition for review.</p>

The requirement of the regulation 5 CFR 1201.204(b) (2022), calling for an explanation of the calculation of a request for damages, is not being applied to appeals initiated prior to the effective date of the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farquhar v.

The Board may waive strict compliance with the regulatory requirements governing specification of damages as long as the agency is on timely notice of a demand for compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yarkon v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-10-1031-P-1 (NP 9/10/2013) ("As the administrative judge noted below, the appellant timely informed the agency that she intended to seek compensatory damages based on her discrimination allegations, <span id="Page_4927"></span>and the agency has not demonstrated that it suffered any undue prejudice by the appellant's delay in identifying an amount sought for compensatory damages. Additionally, there is no evidence that the appellant or her counsel was apprised of the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(b) in the I-1 matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Calhoon v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 14 n.7 (2001) (waiving the requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(b) because the appellant was never apprised of it); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 16 (2009) (the Board provided an appellant, represented by an attorney, the opportunity to meet the requirements of section 1201.204(b) on remand because there was no indication that he ever received the appropriate information with respect to a compensatory damages claim). Moreover, the agency has not identified--and we are not aware of--any precedential decision in which we denied an appellant an opportunity to seek compensatory damages solely because she failed to timely identify the amount of damages sought.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As of 1998, the Board permits AJs to exercise their discretion in directing, upon respondent's articulated request, mental examinations of appellants who seek compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hasler v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HASLER_DWIGHT_F_AT_0752_95_1201_P_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199686.pdf">79 MSPR 415</a>, 419-20 (1998). [Discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-254.html#sec2-251">Medical, Psychiatric Examinations</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before its 1997 regulation, Board decisions defined the time for application for damages. Hearings on damages were discretionary. If damages under the Civil Rights Act were to be awarded, they were to be requested during the appeal on the merits, not for the first time during enforcement proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. DHUD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3302); <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 633, 639-64 (1996) (remanding for the adjudication of compensatory damages following a finding of disability discrimination and the issuance of a supplemental initial decision; "[t]he administrative judge, in his discretion, may hold a hearing on the compensatory damages claim"); <span class="Italic">Yates v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 172, 180 (1996) (implying that an appellant should be placed on notice of the right to seek compensatory damages during the appeal on the merits; the case was remanded for a determination of damages following a finding of disability discrimination); <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 139, 141 (1995) ("The administrative judge ordered the appellant to submit his claim for compensatory damages by a date certain which was later extended at the appellant's request. Despite the extension of time provided, the appellant did not file any evidence or argument regarding compensatory damages before the administrative judge."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd</span>., 73 MSPR 476, 497-98 (1997) (no error when AJ failed to receive evidence on compensatory damages because AJ correctly determined that the appellant's RIF was not discriminatory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the allegations in an appeal could support an award of compensatory damages, the AJ should notify the appellant of his or her right to request the damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EDWARDS_CYRIL_L_NY_0752_08_0344_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_438614.pdf">112 MSPR 196</a>, 202 &#x00B6; 16, 2009 MSPB 166 (2009). The Board implied that an AJ should provide notice of the right to claim (consequential) damages in <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, 103 MSPR 345, 348-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 2006 MSPB 274 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant requested "compensatory" damages on his appeal form. Given his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status at the that time, we will not penalize the appellant for requesting "compensatory" rather than "consequential" damages. <span class="Italic">See Sazegari v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is not required to plead the issues with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding). Nevertheless, his request was <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> and did not meet the form and content requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(b). His first, more detailed request, which was arguably sufficient to meet the form and content requirement, was untimely in that it was made in his post-hearing brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the regulations do not require administrative judges or the Board to provide notice of the right to request consequential damages. However, in <span class="Italic">Calhoon v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 14 n.7 (2001), the Board found it appropriate to waive the appellant's failure to comply with the form and content requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(b) as it applied to a claim of <span class="Italic">compensatory</span> damages where the appellant was never apprised of the requirement. <span class="Italic">See also Hernandez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 418, &#x00B6; 14 (2001). The Board has not addressed the form and content requirement as applied to a claim of <span class="Italic">consequential</span> damages but, as the procedures applicable to the two types of damages are from the same regulation, we hold that they should be treated similarly. In light of the above, we find it appropriate to waive the deadline under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204(a)(2) and forward the appeal to the administrative judge for adjudication of the appellant's claim for consequential damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Urban v. VA</span>, CH-0752-10-0261-B-1 (NP 6/20/2014) (granting petition to reopen to consider and require a remand for evaluation of the appellant's claims for damages based a successful whistleblower defense: "First, because the appellant prevailed on her affirmative defense of whistleblower reprisal, the appellant is entitled to pursue an award of consequential damages and a separate award of attorney fees and costs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6; 10 (1999); <span class="Italic">Zinno v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 290, 296 n.8 (1998); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)-(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.202(a)(1),(a)(4), and (b)(1). Second, in <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (2006), the Board explained that, although its 'regulations do not require administrative judges or the Board to provide notice of the right to request consequential damages,' the Board previously 'found it appropriate to waive the appellant's failure to comply with...(b) [regarding a request for an award of compensatory damages]...where the appellant was never apprised of the requirement,' and it relied on this principle in forwarding the appellant's request for consequential damages to the regional office for adjudication.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims for compensatory damages are not adjudicated in enforcement proceedings. <span class="Italic">Henry v. VA</span>, 108 MSPR 458, 467 &#x00B6; 26, 2008 MSPB 77 (2008). Without statutory authority, the Board cannot award damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McNeel v. OPM,</span> DE-0831-09-0175-X-1 (NP 9/4/2012) ("The Board is without authority to award damages for a deficient payment of disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Giove v.
