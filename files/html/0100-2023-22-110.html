<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-110"><span class="space">1.</span> Work Performed Before Final Adverse Action or Other Decision</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Counsel fees may be awarded for services before the agency final decision (e.g., investigation and preparation leading to the oral and written replies) as long as the services involved the action appealed. <span class="Italic">Barton v. DHEW</span>, 6 MSPR 720, 722-23, 6 MSPB 602 (1981) (fees may include the presentation of a reply to an agency official during reconsideration proceedings following a negative ALOC determination); <span class="Italic">Salvail v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 5 MSPR 521, 522, 5 MSPB 513 (1981) (relying on <span class="Italic">McBride</span>, post: the Board has authority to award attorney fees for services rendered to an appellant before the date of an agency's decision to effect an appealable action as long as the services involved the action appealed); <span class="Italic">McBride v. USDA</span>, 3 MSPR 495, 497, 4 MSPB 17 (1980) (if the Board could not award fees for services before the agency final decision, "the Board would lack the power to provide full recompense for attorney fees incurred as intended by Congress").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rationale for awarding fees for work before a Board appeal was explained in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 539, 546-53 (1985), predicating authority to award fees for preappeal work on both 5 USC 5596 and 5 USC 7701(g). The decision confirmed the compensatory nature of fee awards. It is immaterial under <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that the action defended prior to the appeal (removal) is mitigated to another action that is actually the subject of the appeal (demotion). Under <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the appellant may designate different representatives before the agency and the Board without diminishing his right to fees. There must be a connection between the appeal and the actions rendered at the preappeal stage. As to the waiver of sovereign immunity for fees awarded for work done prior to an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The question posed by this case is whether services at the agency level are sufficiently related to the appeal to be included within the waiver. As discussed below, the Board finds that both the Congressional purpose underlying &#x00A7; 7701(g) and the scope of the companion fee provision in &#x00A7; 5596 of the Back Pay Act indicate that Congress intended the Board to include in the award fees for time spent contesting the proposed action before the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In explaining the rationale for authorizing the Board to award fees, the report accompanying the Senate bill stated (footnote omitted):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees whose agencies have taken unfounded actions against them may spend a considerable amount of money defending themselves against these actions, they cannot be reimbursed for attorney fees upon prevailing in their appeals to the [Civil Service] Commission. Instead, they must file civil actions against the Government in order to obtain a review of their requests for reimbursement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The legislation remedies this problem by authorizing the Board and hearing officials to require payment, by agencies which are losing parties to proceedings before the Board, of attorney fees to the employees who prevailed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on this legislative history, both the Board and the courts have found that a primary purpose that Congress intended to achieve in providing for attorney fee awards was to reduce the financial burden on employees in bringing meritorious appeals<span class="Italic">. Bennett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 699 F.2d 1140, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604, 2 MSPR 445, 453 (1980). It is clear that attorney fees incurred (footnote omitted) by an employee in contesting a proposed action before the agency may represent as substantial a financial burden as fees incurred in subsequently contesting the action before the Board. Given the legislative history in which Congress clearly evidenced a "concern with the amount of money employees might have to spend defending non-meritorious actions," (footnote omitted) we can discern no basis for bifurcating an attorney's representational services into pre- and post-appeal stages and for concluding that fees for the pre-appeal stage are not awardable. If the Board were not authorized to award fees for services rendered in contesting a proposed agency action, the Board would lack the power to "provide full recompense for attorney fees incurred" as Congress clearly intended. <span class="Italic">McBride, supra,</span> 4 MSPB at 18, 3 MSPR at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether the Board has authority to award fees for pre-appeal services under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) must also be considered in light of the other attorney fee provisions in &#x00A7; 5596 and &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) which Congress considered and enacted at the same time. Were the Board to find that &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) does not encompass attorney fees incurred in the pre-appeal stage, this finding would necessarily prohibit the Board from awarding fees for such time when an agency settles an appeal before the Board renders a final decision (footnote omitted). This result is clearly anomalous in light of the fact that under the attorney fee provision of the Back Pay Act at 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596 and its implementing regulations, the employing agency itself may award fees as part of a settlement of a personnel action which the agency has found to be unwarranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.806. When such settlements occur at an early stage of an appeal, it is logical to assume that agency fee awards include fees incurred by the employee at the agency level (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney fee provision of &#x00A7; 5596 expressly refers to the attorney fee provision of &#x00A7; 7701(g) and both the Board and the courts have found that since Congress considered and enacted both provisions at the same time, Congress intended to require that &#x00A7; 5596 fee awards be made in accordance with the standard set forth in &#x00A7; 7701(g). In <span class="Italic">Crowley v. Schultz,</span> 704 F.2d 1269, 1274 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court concluded that "[t]here is no reason to suppose...that judicial relief [for attorney fees] under the Back Pay Act should be treated any differently" from relief under &#x00A7; 7701(g). After examining the legislative history of the attorney fee provision in &#x00A7; 5596, the court found that there was no reason to consider fee awards under &#x00A7; 7701(g) and &#x00A7; 5596 differently in terms of applying the Savings Clause of the Reform Act since these two attorney fee provisions analytically fit together and Congress considered them together. <span class="Italic">Id. See also Sims v. Navy,</span> 711 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting <span class="Italic">Crowley</span> with approval); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris,</span> 2 MSPB 572, 2 MSPR 409, 413 (1980). Under the attorney fee provision in &#x00A7; 5596, recovery includes "reasonable fees related to the personnel action" and courts have found this language broad enough to cover attorney fees for services rendered in both administrative and judicial appeals undertaken to correct an unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Hoska v. Department of the Army,</span> 694 F.2d 270, 273 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Curran v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 714 F.2d 913 (9th Cir. 1983)<span class="Italic">. See also Lizut v. Department of the</span> Army, 27 MSPR 611, 616 (1985) (the Board may award fees under &#x00A7; 5596 for services rendered in connection with the judicial review of a Board decision). Since attorney fee awards under both &#x00A7; 5596 and &#x00A7; 7701(g) are based on the same standard in &#x00A7; 7701(g), we can discern no basis for concluding that Congress intended to allow employing agencies to award fees for pre-appeal services but did not intend to authorize the Board to award the same kind of fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yet another inconsistency would result if the Board were to find that it had no authority to award fees incurred by appellants in contesting proposed actions before their employing agencies. Under both &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) and &#x00A7; 5596, the Board must award attorney fees in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964[42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k)] when the Board's decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii) and 7701(g)(2); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.806(e). Other agencies besides the Board authorized to make fee awards under &#x00A7; 5596 must also utilize the standards of the attorney fee provision in the Civil Rights Act if their decision is based on a finding of prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.806(e). In interpreting the scope of the Civil Rights Act attorney fee provision, the courts have held that an administrative agency, including an employing agency, may award attorney fees to an employee who prevails before it (footnote omitted)<span class="Italic">. Smith v.</span> <span class="Italic">Califano,</span> 446 F. Supp. 530, 534 (D.D.C. 1978)<span class="Italic">. See also Patton v.</span> <span class="Italic">Andrus</span>, 459 F. Supp. 1189 (D.D.C. 1978), <span class="Italic">endorsing Smith.</span> In <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> the court noted that Congress <span id="Page_4644"></span>had expressly authorized only the courts to award attorney fees in Title VII of the Civil Right Act, but the court rejected the contention that agencies could not award attorney fees unless the particular statutory provision authorizing the agency to grant relief from discrimination included the "magic words 'attorney fees'..." <span class="Italic">Smith, supra,</span> at 533. The court further found that denying agencies the authority to award fees would discourage complainants from attempting to vindicate their rights at the agency level, and would relegate the administrative proceeding to a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> process with a poorly developed record that would be less useful to the court on appeal (footnote omitted). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 534.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is evident from the legislative history of the Reform Act that Congress was aware of the decision in <span class="Italic">Smith, supra,</span> during its deliberations on the attorney fees provisions it ultimately enacted in &#x00A7; 5596 and &#x00A7; 7701(g). <span class="Italic">See West, supra,</span> at 105. In addition, after the <span class="Italic">Smith</span> decision was issued the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission amended its regulations to authorize employing agencies as well as the Commission to award attorney fees and costs to prevailing complainants in a manner similar to the findings of the court in <span class="Italic">Smith.</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.271(c) (1980). Those regulations authorized employing agencies to award fees for services rendered to a complainant or applicant after the complaint was filed. Since complainants or applicants initially file their complaints with the employing agency, it is clear that these regulations authorize fee awards for services rendered in contesting the action before the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, at the time that Congress authorized the Board in &#x00A7; 7701(g) and &#x00A7; 5596 to award attorney fees in EEO cases pursuant to the standards in 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k), that statute had been judicially interpreted to authorize agencies to award fees for services performed in contesting proposed actions at the agency level. It is well settled that where Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have knowledge of the judicial or administrative interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute<span class="Italic">. Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 580-81, 98 S. Ct. 866, 869-70, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978). The conclusion that Congress intended to adopt this judicial interpretation is stronger when, as here, Congress was aware of that interpretation. In view of the above, we conclude that in requiring the Board in &#x00A7; 7701(g) and &#x00A7; 5596 to utilize the standards in 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-5(k) in cases where the Board's decision is based on a finding of discrimination, Congress intended such awards to include fees incurred in contesting the action before the agency. This is particularly true where, as discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, construing the statute to authorize the Board to award such fees would effectuate the Congressional intent of reducing the financial burden on employees in bringing meritorious appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> is most directly relevant to the question of whether the Board has authority under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(2) and &#x00A7; 5596 to award fees in EEO cases for pre-appeal representation, we find that the court's reasoning is also persuasive when applied to the question posed in the instant case concerning whether the Board may award such fees in non-EEO cases under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Smith</span> where the court was construing a statute that did not expressly authorize agencies to award attorney fees, Congress has expressly authorized the Board to award fees and the only question remaining is whether the Board's authority extends to the early stages of representation where fees may be incurred. A finding by the Board that &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) does not encompass pre-appeal fees would clearly discourage appellants from attempting to settle their cases before the employing agency, contrary to the public policy favoring speedy resolution of appeals to the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(i)(1) and (4), because it would permit agencies to avoid liability for attorney fees merely by conceding an appeal before the Board issues a final decision. <span class="Italic">Hodnick, supra,</span> 4 MSPB at 434, 4 MSPR at 375. This would place appellants before the Board in an untenable position: like the EEO complainant in <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, an appellant before the Board would "hope his claim was good enough to prevail, but not so good that he would prevail too early." <span class="Italic">Smith, supra,</span> at 534. Similarly, a finding by the Board that it could not award fees incurred at the employing agency level would discourage appellants and their counsel from attempting to develop their case before the employing agency and might result in a less complete record which would be less useful to the Board on appeal."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its position that the Board has no authority to award attorney fees that the appellant incurred in contesting the proposed removal action, the only argument advanced by the agency in this case is that the legislative history of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(3) indicates that Congress did not intend to authorize attorney fees for pre-appeal representation. In this regard the agency points to the following statement by the Senate Committee explaining the provision in &#x00A7; 7513 establishing a right to representation at the pre-decision stage of the adverse action proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;To be accompanied by an attorney or other representative. This provides a new statutory right. The right to be accompanied by a representative at the pre-decision stage is currently authorized by a number of agencies, but the statutory right to representation is restricted to the appellate state of action. The employee may not, however, be represented by an individual whose activities as representative would cause a conflict of interest. The <span class="Italic">provision does not authorize an employing agency to pay the</span> <span class="Italic">cost of an employee's representative,</span> but does not disturb the existing provisions relating to use of official time to represent another employee. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Senate Report, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 50-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained below, we conclude that the quoted language does not evidence a Congressional intent to prohibit the Board from awarding attorney fees incurred at the pre-appeal stage. First, we note that Congress granted a pre-decision right to representation by an attorney or other representative in three other types of actions besides &#x00A7; 7513 actions and neither the statutory language of these provisions nor the legislative history concerning these provisions contains any similar prohibition regarding payment of the cost of this representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(B) (actions for unacceptable performance); &#x00A7; 7503(b)(3) (suspensions for 14 days or less); &#x00A7; 7543(b)(3) (certain actions against Senior Executive Service employees). The omission of any comparable prohibition in these other statutory provisions granting a pre-decision right to representation seriously undermines the agency's contention that Congress generally intended to prohibit the Board from awarding fees for pre-appeal representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we note that a finding by the Board that it has no authority to award fees for pre-appeal representation would seriously diminish the effectiveness of these rights to pre-appeal representation which Congress placed on a statutory footing for the first time in the Reform Act. Third, we conclude that both the ambiguous wording of this provision and its placement in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7513, which does not relate to attorney fees, argue against a broad interpretation that would reach over into the attorney fee provisions in &#x00A7; 7701(g) and &#x00A7; 5596. Had Congress intended the Board and other agencies to exclude pre-appeal fees from their fee awards, this intent would presumably have been reflected in either the express language or legislative history of &#x00A7; 7701(g) and &#x00A7; 5596. A review of these provisions, however, discloses no Congressional intent to prohibit or limit fee awards for pre-appeal services. Finally, we note that the legislative history indicates that Congress viewed costs and fees as separate expenses (footnote omitted). Relying on this legislative history, both the Board and the courts have found that when Congress authorized the Board to award fees, it did not authorize awards of those expenses considered to be taxable costs. <span class="Italic">Bennett, supra,</span> at 1144; <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 2 MSPR at 456. Consequently, we find no persuasive reason to conclude that the prohibition in the Senate Report on the payment of the cost of representation should be read to prohibit an award of attorney fees in the pre-appeal stage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the above discussion, the Board concludes that construing the attorney fee provisions in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596 and 7701(g)(1) and (2) to authorize an award of fees incurred by an appellant in contesting an action before the agency is more in keeping with the purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress than a contrary interpretation. Specifically, this interpretation effectuates Congress' intent by: (1) reducing the financial burden on employees in bringing meritorious appeals; (2) encouraging the expeditious resolution of appeals; (3) enhancing the effectiveness of an employee's right to be represented by an attorney or other representative in the pre-appeal stage of certain actions; and (4) supporting the interrelationship between the attorney fee provisions in &#x00A7; 7701 and &#x00A7; 5596. Based on these considerations, we reaffirm our decision in <span class="Italic">McBride,</span> <span class="Italic">supra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider the question of whether this authority encompasses cases, such as the instant appeal, where the proposed action is mitigated by the agency to another action in which the employee prevails, with a different representative, on appeal to the Board. The record in this appeal shows that with the exception of the penalty, the proposed removal action and the demotion action which the agency ultimately decided to take were in substance the same action. Both actions were based on the same six charges supported by the same 82 examples of alleged unsatisfactory performance. Indeed, the agency did not issue a new proposal notice for the demotion action, and the notice for the proposed removal action became <span class="Italic">sub silentio</span> the proposal notice for the demotion action. Absent the agency's mitigation of the penalty, it is clear that the action appealed to the Board would have been a removal action rather than a demotion action. Under these circumstances, we can discern no grounds for denying fees incurred by the appellant in contesting the proposed removal action. To preclude an award of fees when an agency mitigates the penalty would be to penalize the appellant for achieving a reduction of the penalty, and this result would clearly discourage appellants from attempting to resolve their cases before the agency since the agency could avoid any liability for fees incurred at this stage by mitigating the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, it is clear that the fact that an appellant may designate <span id="Page_4645"></span>different representatives before the agency and the Board has no bearing on an appellant's eligibility for an award of fees. Absent a conflict of interest or other considerations that may arise when an appellant selects an employee representative, appellants are free to select any representative who is willing to serve. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.31; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(e). In light of the foregoing considerations, we conclude that the Board has authority to award fees incurred by an appellant in contesting a proposed action which is subsequently mitigated by the agency and appealed to the Board if the prerequisites for a fee award are otherwise satisfied.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 307-08 (1996), summarized <span class="Italic">Brown</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorney fees incurred in responding to a proposed adverse action are generally recoverable, if the proposal results in an action that the appellant successfully appeals to the Board and the appellant is otherwise entitled to recover attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 539, 544-53 (1985). This rule encourages employees and counsel to develop cases before the agency, with the aim of having a complete, useful record in a Board appeal; in addition, the rule promotes settlement of actions at the agency level. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 550. The question, then, is not whether the appellant was legally entitled to make a second submission to the deciding official, but whether it was reasonable for him to do. The second submission is a detailed discussion of the factors the appellant wished to have the deciding official consider in determining the appropriate penalty. It contains significant information that had not previously been submitted to the deciding official, including a discussion of Board case law on appropriate penalties for tax-related offenses, and how such cases relate to the appellant's offenses. We find that it was reasonable for the appellant's counsel to spend 5 hours in preparing this submission, and we restore those hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The availability of fees for time spent on administrative components of a matter that ripens into a later, successful Board appeal was reaffirmed, <span class="Italic">Richards v. DOJ</span>, 67 MSPR 46, 51-53 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Holland did provide legal counsel to the appellant in connection with the agency's administrative investigation, and the agency does not contest the administrative judge's determination to award fees in that regard. For example, Holland drafted a letter to the agency official who later proposed the appellant's removal, requesting that the official close his investigation without pursuing administrative action. Although the Board has considered the issue of the awardability of attorney fees that are incurred by an appellant contesting a proposed action before the agency, <span class="Italic">see Brown v. U.S. Coast Guard</span>, 28 MSPR 539 (1985), we have not expressly ruled on the issue of the awardability of fees that are incurred by an appellant in seeking to persuade the agency, during its investigation of alleged misconduct, to resolve the matter without issuing a notice of proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 28 MSPR at 545-46, the Board found that 5 USC 7701(g)(1) clearly waived sovereign immunity by authorizing the Board to require the agency to pay reasonable fees incurred by a prevailing appellant. The Board noted that the statute did not, by its terms, limit the waiver of sovereign immunity to fees for services incurred after the effective date of the agency's action; the question posed in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> was whether services at the agency level were sufficiently related to the appeal to be included within the waiver. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 546. The Board concluded that the congressional purpose underlying section 7701(g) and the scope of the companion fee provision in section 5596 of the Back Pay Act indicated that Congress intended the Board to include in the award fees for time spent contesting the proposed action before the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, for many of the same reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, that the appellant may recover attorney fees incurred in seeking to persuade the agency, during its administrative investigation of his alleged misconduct, to resolve the matter without issuing a notice of proposed action. Both the Board and the courts have found that a primary purpose that Congress intended to achieve in providing for attorney fee awards was to reduce the financial burden on employees bringing meritorious appeals. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 28 MSPR at 546 (citations omitted). Attorney fees incurred by an employee in seeking to persuade an agency to either refrain from issuing a notice of proposed action or to otherwise resolve the matter, especially during a lengthy investigation into the alleged misconduct, may represent as substantial a financial burden as fees incurred contesting the proposed action before the employing agency or contesting a final action before the Board. In addition, an employee's representation by counsel during the agency's investigation of alleged misconduct may serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and encourage a fair and speedy resolution of the issue<span class="Italic">. See Brown</span>, 28 MSPR at 550, 552 (the authorization of an award of attorney fees incurred in contesting an action before the agency effectuates congressional intent by, among other things, encouraging the expeditious resolution of appeals before the employing agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the congressional concern with the amount of money employees might have to spend defending non-meritorious actions, we can discern no basis for bifurcating an attorney's representational services into pre- and post-appeal stages and for concluding that fees for the pre-appeal stage are not awardable. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 28 MSPR at 547; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also McBride v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 4 MSPB 17, 3 MSPR 495, 497 (1980) (the Board has jurisdiction to award attorney fees for services rendered to an appellant prior to the issuance of the agency's final decision; if the Board had no such authority, it would lack the power to provide full recompense for attorney fees incurred as intended by Congress). Thus, we find that an interpretation of section 7701(g)(1) to authorize an award of fees incurred by an appellant in seeking to persuade an agency, during its investigation of alleged misconduct, to resolve the matter without issuing a notice of proposed action, is more in keeping with the purpose of the statute and the intent of Congress than a contrary interpretation because it reduces the financial burden on employees in bringing meritorious appeals and may encourage the expeditious resolution of adverse action proceedings.</p>
