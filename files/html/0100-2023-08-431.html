<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-425"><span class="space">f.</span> Other Issues</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">One of the few petitions entertained by the Board to consider an OPM regulation is found in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Sugarman</span>, 4 MSPR 506, 507-09 (1981), granting a portion of a union petition and setting a briefing schedule concerning exclusion from adverse action procedural requirements of furloughs of seasonal, part-time and intermittent employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 7, 1980, Robert M. Tobias, Executive Vice-President and General Counsel of the National Treasury Employees Union, petitioned the Board to review certain regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), pursuant to 5 USC sec. 1205(e)(1)(B). Mr. Tobias requested that the Board review the following regulations and declare their provisions invalid on their face:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR sec. 771.204, which permits agencies to exclude bargaining unit employees from the coverage of agency grievance systems;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR sec. 752.401(c)(2), which excludes actions that entitle employees to grade retention under Part 536 from adverse action procedural requirements; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR sec. 752.401(c)(9), which excludes from adverse action procedural requirements the furlough of seasonal, part-time and intermittent employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth below, we grant the petition for review of the regulation at 5 CFR sec. 752.401(c)(9), but decline to grant review of the two other regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1205(e) provides that the Board shall have "sole discretion" whether to grant a petition such as that presented here. In deciding whether to exercise this discretion, the Board will consider, among other things, the likelihood of a given issue being timely reached through ordinary channels of appeal, the availability of other equivalent remedies, whether the regulation at issue has broad application to the Federal service, and whether the strength of the arguments against its validity are such as to create a reasonable likelihood that the rule, regulation or practice will be found to be invalid under section 1205(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that there is little likelihood that the petitioner would prevail on <span id="Page_821"></span>the merits with respect to his challenge to the regulations at 5 CFR secs. 771.204 and 752.401(c)(2). Section 752.401(c)(2) is simply a restatement of the provisions of 5 USC sec. 5366(b). Thus it is evident that the regulation does not require a personnel practice prohibited by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does it appear likely that section 771.204 would result in a violation of section 2302(b)(9), (10) or (11), as alleged by petitioner. The gravamen of his complaint is that the regulation could be used by agency heads to impede union activities. This appears to be a matter which could be raised with the Federal Labor Relations Authority under 5 USC sec. 7118 and which may more appropriately involve the special expertise of that agency. Accordingly, we decline to review the above regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, petitioner has made a sufficient threshold showing with respect to 5 CFR sec. 752.401(c)(9) to persuade us that review is proper. The petition raises a valid question as to whether OPM has exceeded its authority by restricting the statutory procedures found at 5 USC secs. 7511-7514 (Subchapter II), either as to the specific personnel action at issue (furlough), or the classes of employees involved (part-time, intermittent, and seasonal). We will consider whether Subchapter II implements or directly concerns the merit principles concerned with "fair and equitable treatment" [5 USC 2301(b)(2)], retention on the basis of adequacy of performance [5 USC 2302(b)(6)], and protection from arbitrary action [5 USC 2301(b)(8)(A)], so that its violation constitutes a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC sec. 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The central question with respect to this regulation is whether OPM may validly exclude the named classes of employees from protections of Subchapter II with respect to their furlough "in accordance with conditions established at the time of their appointment." Related to this question are such subsidiary issues as whether OPM has established minimum criteria to assure fairness in the imposition of conditions at the time of appointment, and whether agencies are, as NTEU suggests, abusing their authority to furlough employees for punitive reasons or for reasons other than those set forth in conditions established at the time of their appointment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has original jurisdiction to review rules and regulations promulgated by OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(1). In exercising its jurisdiction, the Board is authorized to declare an OPM rule or regulation invalid on its face if the Board determines that such provision would, if implemented by any agency, require any employee to commit a prohibited personnel practice as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v.

Similarly, the Board has the authority to determine that an OPM regulation has been invalidly implemented by an agency if the Board determines that the regulation, as it has been implemented through any personnel action or policy adopted by an agency in conformity with the OPM regulation, requires commission of a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 3; <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 4;<span class="Italic"> see Prewitt v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Stated somewhat differently, "[t]he essential distinction between facial invalidity and invalid implementation is that the former relates to prospective application of regulations, whereas the latter relates to implementation which has already taken place in some particular agency resulting in commission of a prohibited personnel practice at that agency." <span class="Italic">Avery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1203.11(b)(ii) and (iii) direct the individual requesting review of a regulation to, among other things, identify the OPM regulation being challenged and the reasons why the implementation of the regulation requires commission of a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See Kirkendall</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 5. The Board's regulations also require that the regulation review request identify the prohibited personnel practice at issue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1203.11(b)(iv); <span class="Italic">see Kirkendall</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 86, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as mentioned above, the petitioner has identified the OPM regulation he is requesting the Board to review as 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. That regulation provides that when filling a position in the competitive service "[a]n appointing officer is not required to consider an eligible who has been considered by him for three separate appointments from the same or different certificates for the same position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. The petitioner asserts that the IRS's implementation of this regulation violates the prohibited personnel practice providing that employees shall not "deceive or willfully obstruct any person with respect to such person's right to compete for employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the exception of certain high-level and specialized jobs that have no relevance here, positions in the federal civil service are either in the "competitive service" or the "excepted service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102 and 2103. The regulation identified by the petitioner involves appointment of individuals to the competitive service. A resolution of this case requires an understanding of that appointment process, which is set forth in law and regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After individuals have applied for employment in the competitive service in response to a vacancy announcement, the candidates are rated and ranked and listed on a register in rank order. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3313; <span class="Italic">see</span> OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (DEO Handbook), Chap. 5, Sec. B.[2] The appointing official is then provided a certificate of eligibles and from that list must select an individual from among the three highest ranked candidates. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3317 and 3318(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404; <span class="Italic">see</span> DEO Handbook, Chap 6, Sec. B. For a second and each successive appointment to the same position, the appointing official must select among the three highest ranked remaining candidates. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.404(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook provides guidance to federal agencies on how to hire individuals in the competitive service consistent with law and OPM's rules and regulations. The Handbook may be found on OPM's web page at: <a href="http://www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook_2003/">http://www.opm.gov/deu/Handbook_2003/</a>. We take administrative notice of the Handbook. <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 319, 323 (2001) (the Board may take administrative notice of public documents).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, under OPM's regulations, after an appointing official has considered an individual three times for the same position, the appointing official is no longer required to consider that individual. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405. It is this regulation that the petitioner asserts constitutes a prohibited personnel practice because it obstructs the right to compete for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the petitioner's assertion, IRS's implementation of OPM's regulation does not obstruct an individual's right to compete for employment. Under the regulation, and as implemented by the IRS, an applicant fully competes for a position; he is rated, ranked on a register, placed on a certificate for consideration by the appointing official, and considered for employment by that official. Only after competing unsuccessfully for a position three times does the regulation provide that an individual's name is removed from the certificate. Thus, the individual has competed, albeit unsuccessfully, for the position. In sum, the regulation identified by the petitioner only administers how the competition for employment will take place, it does not obstruct the right to compete.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has previously considered a challenge to the validity of the regulation at issue here as inconsistent with provisions of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944. Pub.L. No. 359, ch. 287; 58 Stat 390; <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 773 F.2d 313, 316 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In finding the regulation proper, the Court <span id="Page_822"></span>noted that the concept articulated in the regulation has existed since the earliest days of the American civil service and predated the veterans' preference statutes. <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 316 (noting that the Civil Service Commission's 1886 report specifies a limit on the number of times a person may be considered for a position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, in the instant case, the concept articulated in the regulation long predates the codification of the prohibited personnel practice articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4). That codification did not occur until the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. It is well settled that Congress is assumed to be aware of administrative interpretations of statutes. <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 783 n.15 (1985); <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 18 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 391 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The fact that Congress, knowing of the long-standing Civil Service Commission policy, conducted a major reform of the civil service system without overturning the policy lends support to the validity of the regulation.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We are aware of nothing in the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act that indicates Congress's disapproval of the concept currently incorporated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner also objects to a provision of the Internal Revenue Service Manual regarding the relationship between suitability determinations and the procedures set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405 discussed above. The provision in question directs that "IRS offices should pursue a suitability determination if the applicant's circumstances meet the established criteria for referral [for such a determination], rather than simply 'non selecting' and working within the 'rule-of-three' for consideration." The petitioner has not identified how this provision requires a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4). To the contrary, the provision, to the extent it could be construed as implementing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.405, states that the procedures contained in the regulation should <span class="Italic">not</span> be used where the suitability determination process is more appropriately used.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner also objects to language in the DEO Handbook regarding the auditing of the appointment process because he asserts it shows that an individual is "nonselected" at the initial examination stage "prior to any introduction of the 'rule of three.'" However, the DEO Handbook does not appear to be an OPM regulation; rather it constitutes OPM's guidance to federal agencies to which OPM has delegated examination authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dean v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DEAN_DAVID_AT_0330_03_0076_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250340.pdf">99 M.S.P.R. 533</a>, 548 (2005), <span class="Italic">stay denied</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 347 (2006) (noting that the DEO Handbook provides agencies with guidance, options and procedures "designed to ensure that examining programs comply with merit system laws and regulations" and "is to be used in conjunction with [among other authorities] regulations"). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>.<span class="Italic"> Brooks v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 207, 210, n.4 (1993) (provisions of OPM's Federal Personnel Manual pertaining to creditable military service were "rules" that the Board has authority to review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f) because they directly implemented and interpreted statutory provisions). The DEO Handbook does not directly implement and interpret statutory provisions. Instead, its stated purpose is to "provide assistance to agencies with delegated examining authority." <span class="Italic">See</span> DEO Handbook, Introduction. Accordingly, it appears that the DEO Handbook is not subject to the Board's regulation review authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f)(1) (the Board has jurisdiction to review the rules and regulations promulgated by OPM); <span class="Italic">Burroughs,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 4 (same); s<span class="Italic">ee</span> <span class="Italic">Public Safety Service Employees Union v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 162, 163 (1997) (finding that the Board lacks the authority to review an Office of Management and Budget Circular because it is not an OPM regulation). Even if the DEO Handbook could be considered a regulation, or, to the extent that the IRS's compliance therewith constitutes its implementation of a related, but unidentified, OPM regulation, the petitioner has not shown how it requires the commission of a prohibited personnel practice. Contrary to the petitioner's assertion, the section of the Handbook he cites does not show that individuals are categorized as "nonselected" at the initial examination stage; rather, the provision cited by the petitioner provides detailed guidance on auditing appointments and accordingly deconstructs the appointment process from its completion. DEO Handbook, Chap 6, Sec. C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the petitioner has not shown that an OPM regulation on its face or as implemented by the IRS requires the commission of a prohibited personnel practice. Accordingly, the petitioner's regulation review is denied.</p>
