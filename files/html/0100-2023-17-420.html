<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-418"><span class="space">c.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Laffey</span></span> Matrix</h5>
<p class="noindent">At least for lawyers practicing in Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas, counsel may claim fees under a schedule, known as the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, a product of <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc.</span>, 572 F. Supp. 354, 371 (D.D.C. 1983), determining that hourly rates for attorneys practicing civil rights law in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area may be pegged to years in practice and adjusted yearly for inflation. The operation of the matrix was explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FMC Carswell and AFGE Local 1006</span>, 65 FLRA 960, 962 n.5 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[5]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix sets forth a method for determining the appropriate hourly rates for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2608</span>, 63 FLRA 486, 487 n.2 (2009). As the Authority has recognized, there are two versions of the matrix. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Dental Activity, Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>65 FLRA 54, 55 n.4 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Army Dental Activity</span>). One version is maintained by the Civil Division of the Office of the United States Attorney, which calculates the matrix rate for each year by adding the change in the overall cost of living as reflected in the United States consumer price index (CPI) for the Washington, D.C. area for the prior year and rounding that rate to the nearest multiple of $5. That version is commonly referred to as the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix. By contrast, the so-called "adjusted" <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix calculates the matrix rates for each year by using the legal services component of the CPI rather than the general CPI. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>As the matrix used by the Arbitrator is commonly referred to as the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, rather than the updated <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, we will use the common reference hereafter.</p>
<p class="noindent">[An iteration of the Matrix is found on the Internet in a spreadsheet that is posted by the Justice Department.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Doubt surfaced as to proper rates of attorneys under the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, and whether it should be used in administrative litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DL v. District of Columbia</span>, 924 F.3d 585, 594 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (Judge Sentelle dissenting). FLRA mentioned, but did not develop issues raised in <span class="Italic">DL</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1633 and VA DeBakey VAMC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-38.html">71 FLRA 211</a>, 219 (2019) (Concurring Opinion of Member Abbott), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whatever possible future revisions may develop, FLRA's treatment of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, as applied by arbitrators making fee awards, is traced through several decisions. The first mention of the matrix appears to be in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 48 FLRA 931, 935-37 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator properly found that the Union's attorneys were entitled to reimbursement at the prevailing market rate rather than on a cost-plus basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 46 FLRA at 1007. The Arbitrator reviewed the number of hours expended by the Union's attorneys and, with certain exceptions explained in his award, determined that the number of hours expended was reasonable. The Arbitrator then reviewed the information provided in the Union's petition for attorney fees and found that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix [<span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines</span>, 572 F. Supp. 343, 371 (D.D.C. 1983), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part and remanded in part</span>, 746 F.2d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1984)] constituted the best evidence of the market rate for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area. We find nothing in the Arbitrator's findings in this regard that is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation. Contrary to the Agency's contentions, we find that the Arbitrator provided a fully articulated, reasoned decision concerning the reasonableness of the amount of attorney fees awarded. Further, we note that the Arbitrator considered and rejected the Agency's argument that the attorney fee rate requested by the Union in another case should be used in this case instead of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. The Agency's exceptions in this regard constitute mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's findings and evaluation of the evidence and provide no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 47 FLRA at 1194.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator's findings in this regard, the Agency has failed to provide any information that demonstrates that the hourly rates set forth in the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix submitted by the Union do not reflect hourly rates that are consistent with those in the community for similar services of lawyers of comparable skill. We note that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix has been approved and used by Federal courts and the EEOC in cases that are similar to this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Trout</span>; <span class="Italic">Fischbach</span>; <span class="Italic">Robles</span>; and <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>. In particular, in <span class="Italic">Trout</span>, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The attorney fee matrix approved in [<span class="Italic">Laffey</span>] was embraced by the Court of Appeals for this Circuit in<span class="Italic"> Save Our Cumberland Mountains v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), and updated in connection with that case. Although the updated matrix was never expressly approved by the court because the parties settled the issue of fees, it does provide an accurate and updated schedule of attorney fees in this District.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">705 F.&#x2003;Supp. at 709 n.10. In accordance with <span class="Italic">Trout</span>, <span class="Italic">Fischbach</span>, <span class="Italic">Robles</span>, and <span class="Italic">Ellison</span>, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's use of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix in determining the prevailing market rate in the District of Columbia for attorney fees in cases under the Back Pay Act is contrary to law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find that the Arbitrator issued a fully articulated and reasoned attorney fee award that supported his conclusion as to the amount of attorney fees to which the Union was entitled, including specific findings demonstrating how the hourly rate and number of hours expended were determined. Although the Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the hourly rates applied by the Arbitrator are not consistent with those in the community for similar services of lawyers of comparable skill. Rather, the Agency is merely disagreeing with the Arbitrator's findings of fact and evaluation of the evidence as to the prevailing market rates for attorneys. Such disagreement provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix was noted in passing, apparently as a reference point for a reasonable fee (it did not appear that the fee was set at the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate), in <span class="Italic">DOD Educ.

<p class="noindent-1">...However, where the attorneys involved are also employees of a union that does not have a customary billing rate, it is necessary to consider whether the rate requested is in line with the prevailing billing rate "in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation." <span class="Italic">United States DOJ, BOP, Fed.

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Academy and AFGE Local 896</span>, 63 FLRA 100, 100-01, 103 (2009), the matrix was applied to an FLSA case in arbitration, although there was no discussion of any retainer agreement or other compensation arrangement between the union and its counsel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that the Union was the prevailing party, the Arbitrator considered whether the attorney fees were reasonable. Applying the "Lodestar"<span class="Italic"> </span>method, the Arbitrator determined that the fees requested by the Union were excessive in relation to the underlying award and adjusted the Union's fee award accordingly.[2] The Arbitrator multiplied the number of hours awarded by the appropriate hourly rate under the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix.[3] She then considered the magnitude of the fees requested in comparison with the value of the underlying award and adjusted the award accordingly by lowering the hours awarded by 25%.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also submitted a copy of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix demonstrating the applicable rates for an attorney with the Union attorney's amount of experience.

With respect to the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator did not specify which <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix applied, the Arbitrator here applied the rate under the updated <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix that directly corresponded to the number of years the attorney had been practicing and in the area where the attorney practiced (Washington, D.C.). In calculating the appropriate rate of attorney fees, the Arbitrator applied the community rate under <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> to the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation using "Lodestar,"<span class="Italic"> </span>reducing the overall award to account for the disparity in the award of attorney fees versus the amount involved in the underlying award.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator made no explicit finding as to the location of counsel's office, he stated that Union counsel's "home base" is Baltimore. In addition, the Union submitted counsel's affidavit, which asserts that counsel has been licensed in Maryland and has practiced in the Baltimore area since 1998. Union counsel also submitted a copy of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, which lists the applicable rates for an attorney with eight years of experience.[2] Based on the foregoing, we find that the record is sufficient to establish that Union counsel's ordinary community of practice is the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Arbitrator's conclusion, the Authority has routinely applied the rates found in the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix to arbitration matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, United States Naval Academy, Nonappropriated Fund Program Div.,</span> 63 FLRA 100, 103 (2009); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1938,</span> 61 FLRA at 646; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C., </span>48 FLRA 931, 936 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Next arrived <span class="Italic">DHS Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement and AFGE Local 1924</span>, 64 FLRA 1003, 1004-08 (2010) (<span class="Italic">ICE</span>), involving a successful challenge to a suspension (mitigated to a reprimand with backpay). FLRA declined to permit an arbitrator to award <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates when the retainer agreement between the union and its counsel set a lower hourly rate, but with a provision allowing counsel to seek the highest allowable prevailing market rates:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the requested hourly billing rate, the Arbitrator stated that the rate set forth in the retainer agreement between the Union's attorney and the grievant--$330 per hour--is the "presumed reasonable rate[.]" However, the Arbitrator found that the Union's attorney "rebutted that presumption" by submitting evidence that the requested rate of "$440/465" (hereinafter "the $465 hourly rate") was the prevailing market rate for attorneys who, like the Union's attorney, ordinarily practice in Washington, D.C.[3] This evidence included declarations from the Union's attorney and two other attorneys with employment law practices in the Washington, D.C. area, a copy of the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix and the retainer agreement.[4] The Arbitrator cited the retainer agreement, which states that the Union's attorney would request attorney fees at "prevailing market rates." Based on these factors, the Arbitrator found that the requested $465 hourly rate was the prevailing market rate for attorneys who, like the Union's attorney, ordinarily practice in Washington, D.C. Therefore, the Arbitrator found that the $465 hourly rate was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The record indicates that the Union's attorney sought to charge a $440 hourly rate from June 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008, and a $465 hourly rate from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009. Additionally, we note that at one point, the Arbitrator refers to the rate of "$440/$460[,]" but this appears to be a typographical error.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix is a document prepared by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia reflecting prevailing market rates for attorneys in Washington, D.C. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS</span>, 48 FLRA 931, 932 n.* (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's exception as to the claimed hourly rate, there is a presumption that an agreed-upon fee between client and counsel is the "maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded absent clear evidence to the contrary." <span class="Italic">Fort McClellan Educ. Ass'n</span>, 56 FLRA 644, 645 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Fort McClellan</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base</span>, 32 FLRA at 1108). This presumption is "rebuttable by convincing evidence that the counsel's customary rate for similar work is higher and either that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations or was provided only because of the client's inability to pay." <span class="Italic">Fort McClellan</span>, 56 FLRA at 645-46 (citing <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, 206 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Gensburg</span>)). Affidavits stating the prevailing rate in the community do not demonstrate that an hourly rate that is higher than the hourly rate in a fee agreement is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Kennard v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 231, 236 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Kennard</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Arbitrator, the retainer agreement in this case sets forth a billing rate of $330 per hour, but also states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">These billing rates [$330 an hour] are at or below the "prevailing market rates,...charged in this legal community. In this legal market, it is the usual and customary practice for law firms like mine to ordinarily charge clients at reduced hourly rates to reflect non-economic goals.... Thereafter, if and when we are in a position to seek recovery of legal fees, we apply for such fees...at the highest allowable prevailing market rates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the retainer agreement set forth a $330 hourly rate, and that the rate set forth in the retainer agreement is the "presumed reasonable rate[.]" The Arbitrator then determined that the Union's attorney rebutted this presumption by showing that the requested $465 hourly rate was consistent with the prevailing rate for Washington, D.C.-based attorneys. On this basis, the Arbitrator concluded that the $465 hourly rate was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, the Arbitrator did not find, and the record does not indicate, that the Union's attorney charged a rate higher than the $330 hourly rate listed in the retainer agreement for similar work. As Authority and MSPB precedent require such a finding to rebut the presumption that the fee listed in the retainer agreement is the maximum reasonable fee, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable is inconsistent with Authority and MSPB precedent. <span class="Italic">See Fort McClellan</span>, 56 FLRA at 645; <span class="Italic">Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. at 206. Further, declarations from the Union's attorney and two other attorneys with employment law practices in the Washington, D.C. area, that the $465 hourly rate is consistent with the prevailing market rate, do not establish that the Union's attorney is entitled to receive an hourly rate higher than the rate listed in the retainer agreement. <span class="Italic">See Kennard</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 236.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union's attorney did not demonstrate, and the record does not indicate, that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion, that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, is contrary to law. As such, we modify the amount of the Fee Award to reflect a $330 hourly rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's application of the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix was to continue in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 65 FLRA 54, 57, 58-59 (2010), involving an arbitrator's award reducing the grievants' suspensions to reprimands. There was no suggestion that the result was based on discrimination or reprisal. FLRA found no bar to an arbitrator using not only the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, but an "adjusted [higher]" <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, although FLRA required that the hourly rate be adjusted for the dates that service was performed rather than the date the case was completed and the fee petition was submitted. The <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span> case returned to FLRA after an earlier decision remanded the case. In the earlier decision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 62 FLRA 70, 73 (2007), FLRA described the fee arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Legal Fees. Client agrees to pay for legal services...at the following rates...:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">$423.00 per hour for attorney; $239 per hour for associate; $130 per hour for law clerk and paralegal. These rates will be adjusted every June 1, and will be consistent with the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. Client may be charged a reduced fee in the public interest, but agrees to pay the full fee upon receipt of a successful decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">On the return engagement, FLRA approved <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates based on that fee arrangement, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 65 FLRA 54, 55, 57-59 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged by the Union's attorneys, the Union's attorneys provided the Arbitrator with the fee agreement, as well as affidavits and other evidence of prevailing market rates. In addressing the hourly rates, the Arbitrator focused on the fee agreement between the Union and the attorneys. The agreement provided that the attorneys may charge the Union "a reduced fee in the public interest[.]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army</span>, 62 FLRA at 73 (quoting the fee agreement). However, the agreement also provided that the attorneys would charge the Union hourly rates consistent with the "[a]djusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix" "upon receipt of a successful decision." [4] <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's claim that the reduced rate was the attorneys' customary rate and the rate he was required to apply. The Arbitrator <span id="page_2477"></span>found that his merit awards constituted a "successful decision" within the meaning of the fee agreement and that the agreement to pay rates consistent with the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix applied. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix sets forth a method for determining the appropriate hourly rate for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. area. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2608</span>, 63 FLRA 486, 487 n.2 (2009). As recognized by the Arbitrator and as explained by the court in <span class="Italic">Smith v. D.C.</span>, 466 F. Supp.2d 151 (D.D.C. 2006), there are two versions of the matrix. One version is maintained by the Civil Division of the Office of the United States Attorney, which calculates the matrix rate for each year by adding the change in the overall cost of living as reflected in the United States consumer price index (CPI) for the Washington, D.C. area for the prior year and rounding that rate to the nearest multiple of $5. 466 F. Supp 2d at 156. That version is commonly referred to as the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix. By contrast, the so-called "adjusted" <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix calculates the matrix rates for each year by using the legal services component of the CPI rather than the general CPI. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) that the amount of fees be reasonable has two components: (1) reasonableness of the hourly rate; and (2) reasonableness of the number of hours expended. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, <span class="Italic">Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement</span>, 64 FLRA 1003, 1007 (2010) (<span class="Italic">ICE</span>). Here, only the reasonableness of the hourly rate is disputed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fee agreement between the Union and the attorneys provides that the attorneys may charge the Union a reduced fee, but that the attorneys would charge hourly rates consistent with the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix upon receipt of a successful decision. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army</span>, 62 FLRA at 73. In <span class="Italic">United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine</span>, 53 FLRA 1688, 1692 (1998) (<span class="Italic">PPQ</span>), the Authority held that a similar fee agreement permitted the arbitrator to award fees at the law firm's non-retainer, billing rates as long as they were reasonable and consistent with prevailing market rates. Accordingly, on the basis of <span class="Italic">PPQ</span>, we deny the Agency's exception contending that the reduced fee must apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has specifically identified the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix as "the Washington, D.C./Baltimore rate" and applied it to an attorney whose "ordinary community of practice is the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area" while "home base[d]" in Baltimore. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2608</span>, 63 FLRA 486, 487-88 (2010). Moreover, the Authority's approach is consistent with the judicial approach to the matrix. <span class="Italic">Cobell v. Norton</span>, 231 F. Supp.2d 295, 302 (D.D.C. 2002) (describing the matrix as establishing a standard hourly rate for attorneys in "the Baltimore-Washington area"). Accordingly, the fact that the attorneys' office is located in Baltimore provides no basis for finding the application of adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's application of the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, instead of the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, also provides no basis for finding the award deficient. Although the Authority has not addressed whether use of the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, rather than the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix, is appropriate for an award of attorney fees in accordance with the standards of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the court in <span class="Italic">DL v. D.C.</span>, 256 F.R.D. 239 (D.D.C. 2009), noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has not expressed a preference between the <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix and the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix and has "suggested that the trial court should have discretion in determining the appropriate rates." 256 F.R.D. at 243 &#x0026; n.4. In view of this approach by the court that established the matrices, we conclude that the Arbitrator was not precluded from applying the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix as a matter of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency further fails to demonstrate that the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix does not establish reasonable hourly rates consistent with prevailing market rates for the Union's attorneys. In this regard, courts have affirmed the award of attorney fees at adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates as reasonable for attorneys practicing in the Washington, D.C./Baltimore, Maryland area. <span class="Italic">Salazar v. D.C.</span>, 123 F. Supp.2d 8, 15 (D.D.C. 2000). In addition, the Union's attorneys provided the Arbitrator with case citations demonstrating that they have been awarded attorney fees at adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates. Specifically, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission awarded the Union's attorneys fees at adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates in <span class="Italic">Doe v. SSA</span>, Case No. 120-2003-00498X (2007). The Union's attorneys also submitted arbitration awards in which arbitrators awarded them fees at adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates and settlement agreements in which other agency employers agreed to pay them fees at adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates. In view of this extensive precedent and evidence, the Agency's dispute with the Arbitrator's reliance on the settlement agreement in which the Agency agreed to pay adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates fails to establish that the award is deficient. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 23, 26 (2001) (agency failed to establish that the hourly rate awarded by the arbitrator did not reflect the prevailing billing rate in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its final exception, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's application of adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates as they existed on the date of the award, rather than as they existed when the attorneys rendered their services, is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), as interpreted and applied by the MSPB. When an exception contends that an award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Authority looks to the decisions of the MSPB and follows its practices in resolving the exception. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2608</span>, 63 FLRA at 487. In interpreting and applying &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the MSPB has recognized that there is no explicit provision for interest on attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Krape v. DOD</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430, 435 (2004). Consequently, the MSPB does not permit the retroactive application of current hourly rates to account for delay in payment of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Arbitrator's application of adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates as they existed on the date of the award retroactively to account for no provision for interest is contrary to the MSPB's standards and practices established under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See id. </span>The Union does not dispute MSPB's practice, but claims, instead, that such enhancement is commonplace under other fee-shifting statutes. However, the standards of other fee-shifting statutes are not relevant because the Arbitrator's award must be in accordance with the standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), which it is not. On this basis, we modify the award to provide that the amount of fees must be recalculated at the adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey </span>matrix rates as they existed at the time of performance of the legal services.</p>
<p class="noindent">What is the difference between <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span> (success with <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>) and <span class="Italic">ICE</span> (not so successful)? In <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg</span>, the union client was responsible for the higher rate if its counsel prevailed. In <span class="Italic">ICE</span> the client was not responsible for the higher rate when its counsel prevailed. The distinction may lie in the operating premise that the retainer agreement sets the presumed maximum reasonable rate.</p>
<p class="noindent">Considering a substantial counsel fee petition in a case coming from the Court of Federal Claims, and addressing the interest of counsel to be compensated at a national rate, the Federal Circuit considered the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, and the "Kavanaugh Matrix" in <span class="Italic">Biery v. United States</span>, 818 F.3d 704, 710, 712-15 (Fed. Cir. 2016), affirming the lower court's use of the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Though a trial court has discretion in determining a fee award, it must "provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award." <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983). A fee award that is determined through the use of a lodestar calculation carries a "strong presumption" that it represents a "reasonable" attorney fee. <span class="Italic">Bywaters v. United States</span>, 670 F.3d 1221, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (citing <span class="Italic">City of Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557, 562 (1992)). Departures from the lodestar figure, once calculated, must be supported by "specific evidence" justifying the award. <span class="Italic">Perdue v. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn</span>, 559 U.S. 542, 553 (2010). Ultimately, a fee award must "be adequate to attract competent counsel," but must not "produce windfalls to attorneys." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 444 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regards to the merits of the fee award, counsel challenges the cuts made based on work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs, the Court of Federal Claims' use of the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, the use of historical rates, its determination of the standard St. Louis hourly rate, and reductions to the work done for the Kansas Supreme Court argument and fee motions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel argues that the Court of Federal Claims erred when it reduced the number of hours and costs awarded by 30% to take into account work done on behalf of the unsuccessful plaintiffs. Counsel characterizes this reduction as an overall adjustment to the lodestar figure that must be supported by specific evidence under <span class="Italic">Perdue</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel argues that the Court of Federal Claims abused its discretion by not applying the Kavanaugh Matrix and instead applying the lower Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc</span>., the District Court for the District of Columbia set out a matrix of reasonable rates for attorneys in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area who were engaged in complex federal litigation at that time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 572 F. Supp. 354, 371-72 (D.D.C.), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part</span>, 746 F.2d 4 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">overruled by Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). This matrix of fees has become known as the "<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix" and its use has been expressly endorsed by the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as a "useful starting point" for computing attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. District of Columbia</span>, 57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995). We have not had occasion to determine whether the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is an appropriate starting point for fee awards, but have acknowledged its use by the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">See Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1226 &#x0026; n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">see also Rodriguez v. Sec'y of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 632 F.3d 1381, 1384-85 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (distinguishing Vaccine Act cases from "complex litigation" described in <span class="Italic">Laffey</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the matrix proposed by <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> was based on prevailing market rates for a single point in time, courts have found it necessary to determine similar matrices for other years using the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates as a starting point. <span class="Italic">See Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc</span>., 857 F.2d at 1525. To this end, <span id="page_2478"></span>two competing approaches have been applied by district courts and the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first approach is for courts to use the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix which is maintained by the United States Attorney's Office. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rooths v. District of Columbia</span>, 802 F. Supp.2d 56, 62 (D.D.C. 2011); <span class="Italic">First Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Assoc. of Rochester v. United States</span>, 88 Fed. Cl. 572, 586 (Fed. Cl. 2009). Adjustments to this version of the matrix are based on changes to the cost of living in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ("CPI-U"). United States Attorney's Office, District of Columbia, <span class="Italic">Laffey Matrix--2014-2015</span>, at 1, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey%20Matrix _2014-2015.pdf">http://www.justice.gov/usao/dc/divisions/Laffey%20Matrix _2014-2015.pdf</a>. The CPI-U measures the average change in price of a market basket of goods and services including food, shelter, and medical and legal services. <span class="Italic">See</span> Bureau of Labor and Statistics, <span class="Italic">CPI Detailed Report: Data for December 2015</span>, at 14, 203, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpid1512.pdf">http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpid1512.pdf</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second approach is to use the "Kavanaugh Matrix," advanced by economist Dr. Michael Kavanaugh, which makes adjustments to the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix based on changes to the Legal Services Index ("LSI") component of the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1226 &#x0026; n.4; <span class="Italic">Eley v. District of Columbia</span>, 999 F. Supp.2d 137, 150 (D.D.C. 2013), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded by</span> 793 F.3d 97 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The motivation behind these adjustments is to provide adjustments that solely capture the market for legal services and do not take other consumer goods into account, such as food, housing, gas, and clothing. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 750 F. Supp.2d 70, 73 (D.D.C. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both approaches are subject to criticism and no circuit has expressly adopted one over the other.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 809 F.3d 58, 64-65 (D.C. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Bywaters</span>, 670 F.3d at 1226 &#x0026; n.4; <span class="Italic">Interfaith Cmty. Org. v. Honeywell Int'l, Inc</span>., 426 F.3d 694, 709-10 (3d Cir. 2005). The Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix has been criticized because it takes a broad basket of goods and services into account, including food and fuel, and may thus yield results that are higher or lower than the average rates private consumers of legal services in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area actually pay. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. District of Columbia</span>, 123 F. Supp.2d 8, 14-15 (D.D.C. 2000). The Kavanaugh Matrix has been criticized for its use of the national CPI, and may thus not be an accurate measure of the relevant community, here the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. <span class="Italic">See Eley</span>, 999 F. Supp.2d at 152.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The criticisms levied against both the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix and the Kavanaugh Matrix are well-founded and reasonable. Conversely, the arguments for each are also compelling. Consequently, we decline to exclusively endorse either for use in a lodestar calculation. The decision to use either matrix as a starting point to determine a lodestar is within the discretion of a trial court. <span class="Italic">See Interfaith Cmty. Org</span>., 426 F.3d at 709 ("[T]he original <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is an appropriate starting point...."); <span class="Italic">Covington</span>, 57 F.3d at 1109 (noting that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix provides a "useful starting point."). However, it would be an abuse of discretion for a court to blindly use either matrix without considering all the relevant facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Eley v. District of Columbia</span>, 793 F.3d 97, 104 (D.C. Cir. 2015). As previously noted, though a court has broad discretion in computing a lodestar, the court must "provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 437. This includes the decision to use either the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix or the Kavanaugh Matrix and any departure, or no departure, from the rates they suggest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Court of Federal Claims compared the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rate with fees awarded to counsel's law firm in two district court cases and found those rates lower than, if not comparable to, the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates. In doing so, the Court of Federal Claims explained that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rate was sufficient to adequately compensate counsel, but not so high as to be a "windfall" to counsel. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 444.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Counsel argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the Court of Federal Claims to rely on fee awards from other jurisdictions in determining the fee award in this case.&#x2003;However, because counsel had previously requested fees based on a "national" rate, the use of awards from other jurisdictions as a comparative base was reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims did not abuse its discretion in its determination that the Adjusted <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix provided a reasonable rate for the lodestar calculation.</p>
