<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-18"><span class="space">a.</span> Evolution of the Doctrine; Confirmation of the Midterm Bargaining Obligation</h5>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine was established in the federal sector after FLRA became entangled with decisions of reviewing courts that found unpersuasive or incapable of predictable application prior approaches by FLRA to the question of when midterm or impact and implementation bargaining was barred by provisions of existing contracts.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's early position was that unless there was a clear and unmistakable waiver of bargaining rights, an agency had a duty during the term of a collective bargaining agreement to negotiate prior to making changes in established conditions of employment and the exclusive representative must be given notice of the changes and an opportunity to negotiate. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 5 FLRA 9, 9, 22-23 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 46 FLRA 1184 (1993); <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 45 FLRA 1290 (1992); <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 45 FLRA 1090 (1992) (ALJ Decision). A contract waiver was to be clear. That the parties considered a broader scope of an agreement, or that they were inclined to broaden their agreement but did not do so in the finished product, did not support a contract waiver of bargaining rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 39 FLRA 120 (1991), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 44 FLRA 145 (1992) (dispute over extent of smoking ban arrived at in MOU). Early cases made it difficult for an agency to rely on existing contract language to preclude midterm bargaining. To avoid ULP charges, it was insufficient that a contract clause could arguably be interpreted as constituting a waiver. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Boise and AFGE Local 1273</span>, 40 FLRA 992 (1991); <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA 1568, 1575 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under law predating the current formulation of the covered-by doctrine, although a contract contained procedures concerning cancelation of approved leave, a new holiday leave policy that resulted in a change of leave for employees during holidays was not addressed by the contract and was not a subject of bargaining was clearly and unmistakably waived. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region IV, Miami and NTEU</span>, 19 FLRA 304, 312-13 (1985) (ALJ Decision). A contract provision requiring new or changed performance standards to be discussed with employees did not waive impact bargaining when performance standards were changed by the employer. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 2221</span>, 21 FLRA 609, 610-11 (1986). An article in a negotiated agreement concerning notice and rotation of overtime did not waive impact bargaining over a management decision effectively establishing a work roster requiring about 13 hours a week in required overtime. <span class="Italic">DOD, Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 21 FLRA 679, 694 (1986) (ALJ Decision). But, in contrast, by agreeing in a negotiated contract that management could determine in advance all coverage requirements necessary for adjustments of employees taking lunch hours during shifts, subject to challenge by grievance, the union waived its right to prior negotiations on a scheduling change. <span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE Local 32</span>, 23 FLRA 724, 726 (1986). As to proof, it could be impossible to determine if there was a conscious waiver of a right without considering or exploring negotiations leading up to a contract provision indicating a restriction upon a union's statutory right. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth FEMTC</span>, 4 FLRA 619, 625 (1980) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">The problem that led to refinement of the "covered by" doctrine arose when the union sought mid-term bargaining over a matter unrelated to a specific mid-term change by management in employment conditions. In <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU,</span> 17 FLRA 731, 736-37 (1985), FLRA considered whether an agency was required to bargain when a union raised a demand for negotiations during the term of the contract as to a matter unrelated to management-initiated changes in conditions of employment. FLRA concluded that Congress intended to limit the bargaining obligation over union-initiated proposals to situations where parties were negotiating a basic collective bargaining agreement. Outside <span id="Page_1224"></span>that context, Congress intended the bargaining obligation to exist only as to changes in established conditions of employment proposed by management. FLRA noted that if management sought to alter an established condition of employment in a manner not precluded by the agreement, it was obligated to notify the union and provide to the union an opportunity to bargain over the change to the extent that it may be within the scope of the bargaining or its impact and implementation. Additionally, where parties negotiated a reopener provision in their agreement, timely negotiable proposals submitted in connection and consistent with that provision were subject to the mutual obligation to bargain:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Were the Authority to now hold that there is a statutory obligation for agency management to bargain at any time during the life of a collective bargaining agreement over union-initiated proposals which are unrelated to changes initiated by agency management, the ability of the parties to rely upon such basic agreements as a stable foundation for their day-to-day relations would be diminished. Parties would be discouraged from engaging in the effort, as part of negotiation of their basic collective bargaining agreement, to foresee potential labor-management relations issues, and resolve those issues in as comprehensive a manner as practicable. Instead, such a holding would encourage dispersal of the collective bargaining process. It is difficult to envision that Congress, with its interest in the achievement of effective and efficient Government through collective bargaining and the execution of collective bargaining agreements, intended to provide such a disincentive to bargaining for a contract and such an incentive to continuous bargaining on an issue-by-issue basis....</p>
<p class="noindent">The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU,</span> 18 FLRA 361 (1985). A union could not request midterm negotiations of flextime if there had been no change in the unit members' conditions of employment and if the request for negotiations was not submitted in accordance with the reopener provision of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Missouri NG, Office of Adjutant Gen. and NAGE, Local R14-68</span>, 18 FLRA 340, 342-43 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> <span class="Italic">following remand</span> 31 FLRA 1244 (1988) (following <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 17 FLRA 731 (1985)). A midterm bargaining obligation did not occur if management secured additional rights to perform some responsibility, e.g., recruitment and examination of employees through OPM delegation, but management did not deviate from past procedures. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 361, 362-63 (1985). If no procedures were implemented by the agency, the change in law--e.g., passage of the Debt Collection Act of 1982--did not constitute a change in working conditions justifying midterm negotiations without a contract reopening provision. <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City and NFFE Local 29</span>, 18 FLRA 358, 359 (1985), <span class="Italic">rev'd following remand and reconsideration</span>, 30 FLRA 1174 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's position in the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> cases, 17 FLRA 731 (1985), and 18 FLRA 361 (1985), was reviewed and its position on midterm bargaining rejected by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295, 296-301 (D.C. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arises under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FLRS), 5 U.S.C. Secs. 701-7135 (1982 &#x0026; Supp. II 1984), which was enacted as Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. The FLRS establishes a statutory framework to regulate labor relations between federal agencies and their employees. A key component of the statute is the Federal Labor Relations Authority, an independent agency, which performs a role analogous to that of the <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board</span>. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 92-93, 104 S. Ct. 439, 441-42, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983); <span class="Italic">Turgeon v. FLRA</span>, 677 F.2d 937, 939 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>). The Authority, whose responsibility is to carry out the purpose of the FLRS, is to "provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance relating to matters under [the statute]." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7105(a)(1) (1982). Among its other duties, the FLRA hears appeals pertaining to charges of unfair labor practices, including the refusal to bargain in good faith. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sec. 7105(a)(2)(A)-(I).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FACTS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioner, the National Treasury Employees Union, is the exclusive representative of employees of the IRS in its national, regional, and district offices, as well as at the Detroit Data Center and the National Computer Center. The union and the IRS entered into two separate collective-bargaining agreements covering IRS employees represented by the union. On two separate occasions, the union made written requests to bargain with the IRS over issues not addressed in the existing collective-bargaining agreements. In both instances, the IRS refused to bargain, contending that it had no duty to negotiate over union proposals in the middle of the agreements' terms. The duty to bargain midterm, the IRS asserted, arose only when the IRS, i.e., the agency, proposed changes. In both cases, the union filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the first case, the administrative law judge found that the agency had committed a ULP because its statutory duty to bargain included midterm, union-initiated proposals. In the second case, the administrative law judge found that the delegation of certain recruitment functions from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to the IRS constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to create a duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority reversed the decisions of the administrative law judge.&#x2003;In the first case, the union made a written request to bargain with respect to certain conditions of employment, such as the use of government cars, permission to work at home, and worksite selection. The IRS contended that it had no duty to bargain because the agency had made no changes in the areas covered by the proposals. The Authority held that the duty to bargain extended only to negotiations leading to a basic agreement and to midterm proposals initiated by the agency, not to midterm proposals initiated by the union. <span class="Italic">IRS v. National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 17 F.L.R.A. 731, 738 (1985). The Authority found support for this position in a Senate Committee Report that accompanied a Senate bill, which, although not enacted into law, contained certain provisions that were similar to the FLRS, as enacted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 17 F.L.R.A. at 735-37 (citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 40 (1978)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also purported to rely on the congressional mandate to interpret the statute "in a manner consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient Government." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101(b). The Authority concluded that the statutory duty to bargain did not include union-initiated, midterm proposals because midterm negotiations would undermine stability, and discourage the parties from anticipating future issues at the time of the basic contract negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 17 F.L.R.A. at 736-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the second case, the Authority also reversed the decision of the ALJ. <span class="Italic">IRS v. National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 18 F.L.R.A. 361, 363 (1985). The Authority stated that the IRS would have a statutory duty to bargain only if the negotiations were directed toward a basic collective-bargaining agreement, or if the negotiations concerned a management-initiated change in employment conditions. The Authority rejected the ALJ's conclusion that a change in employment conditions had occurred as a result of the IRS assuming the recruitment duties previously performed by the OPM. Since it was undisputed that the IRS had not altered the recruitment process that it had acquired from the OPM, the Authority concluded that the IRS had committed no unfair labor practice because the IRS had no duty to bargain over the union's proposals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 F.L.R.A. at 362-63.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In establishing the FLRA, Congress intended the Authority "to develop specialized expertise in its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the act." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA,</span> 464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S. Ct. 439, 444, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983) (<span class="Italic">BATF</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp.,</span> 373 U.S. 221, 236, 83 S. Ct. 1139, 1149, 10 L. Ed.2d 308 (1963));<span class="Italic"> see </span>15 U.S.C. Sec. 7105. Pursuant to well established principles of administrative law, it is appropriate for a reviewing court to accord due weight to an agency's interpretation of a statute that the agency has been entrusted to administer. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. City of Fulton,</span> 106 S. Ct. 1422, 1428, 89 L. Ed.2d 661 (1986); <span class="Italic">Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB,</span> 441 U.S. 488, 496, 99 S. Ct. 1842, 1848, 60 L. Ed.2d 420 (1979). Thus, the court will defer to the agency's interpretation of the statute, if the interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the intent of the legislature, or with the guiding purpose of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). Nevertheless, as the Supreme Court has emphasized, the deference owed to an expert tribunal cannot be allowed to result in the unauthorized assumption by an agency of major policy decisions properly made by Congress. <span class="Italic">BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 97, 104 S. Ct. at 444 (quoting <span class="Italic">American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB,</span> 380 U.S. 300, 318, 85 S. Ct. 955, 967, 13 L. Ed.2d 855 (1965)). Indeed, it may be said that deference to an agency's interpretation reflects a judicial determination that the agency's interpretation falls within the scope of the authority that has been properly delegated by Congress to the agency. <span class="Italic">See Montana v. Clark,</span> 749 F.2d 740, 745 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 106 S. Ct. 246, 88 L. Ed.2d 255 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is axiomatic that "the starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania,</span> Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980); <span class="Italic">see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. National Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). Title 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7114 provides in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1) A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4) Any agency and any exclusive representative in any appropriate unit in the agency, through appropriate representatives, shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. Sec. 7114(a)(1), (4) (1982). The statute also provides the following definitions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1225"></span>(8) "collective bargaining agreement" means an agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining pursuant to the provisions of this chapter;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(12) "collective bargaining" means the performance of the mutual obligation of the representative of an agency and the exclusive representative of employees in an appropriate unit in the agency to meet at reasonable times and to consult and bargain in a good faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment affecting such employees and to execute, if requested by either party, a written document incorporating any collective bargaining agreement reached, but the obligation referred to in this paragraph does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. Sec. 7103(a)(8), (12) (1982) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute neither specifies nor distinguishes midterm bargaining, union-initiated bargaining, and any other type of bargaining. Thus, there is no express support in the governing statute for the Authority's conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its first decision, the Authority relied on a quotation from the Senate Report that referred to a duty to bargain "in the context of negotiations leading to a basic collective bargaining agreement." 17 F.L.R.A. at 735 (emphasis in original) (quoting S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 40 (1978)). This report pertains to the Senate bill that was rejected by both the House of Representatives and the Conference Committee. The provision to which the quotation refers, however, is similar to one included in the final Act. While there may be some basis for the Authority's conclusion that the Senate report distinguished between basic and midterm agreements, this distinction did not survive the rejection by Congress of the Senate's restrictive view of the rights of labor and the importance of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this Court has made clear, Title VII, as enacted, was designed to expand the scope of negotiation from its limited role under the then existing law. <span class="Italic">See Library of Congress v. FLRA,</span> 699 F.2d 1280, 1283-86 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA,</span> 659 F.2d 1140, 1154-56 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span> 455 U.S. 945, 102 S. Ct. 1443, 71 L. Ed.2d 658 (1982). The adoption of the House version of the legislation represents a repudiation of the narrow view of collective bargaining that would have been codified by the Senate bill. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA,</span> 691 F.2d 553, 559-61 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Since the Senate bill clearly demonstrated a more restrictive approach than the House bill, an ambiguous passage in the Senate Report cannot be regarded as reflecting the intent of Congress in enacting the House bill. Nevertheless, the existence of this distinction in the Senate Report indicates that at least some members of Congress were aware of this issue. If Congress had intended to embrace the narrow approach of the Senate on this question, it would have manifested or expressed its intention. The language of section 7114(a), however, is as broad and unqualified as the other sections of the statute, and does not reflect the restrictive view expressed in the fragment of legislative history upon which the Authority relied for support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">PRIVATE SECTOR LAW</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no question that Congress was fully aware of the analogy between the FLRS and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 29 U.S.C. Secs. 151-168 (1982). <span class="Italic">See BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 97, 104 S. Ct. at 444; <span class="Italic">Department of Defense v. FLRA,</span> 659 F.2d 1140, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span> 455 U.S. 945, 102 S. Ct. 1443, 71 L. Ed.2d 658 (1982). Indeed, the FLRA was modeled on the NLRB, and other provisions of Title VII are crafted either by analogy or by contrast. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7102 <span class="Italic">with</span> 29 U.S.C. Sec. 157 (employees rights); 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7116 with 29 U.S.C. Sec. 158 (unfair labor practices); 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7116(b)(7) with 29 U.S.C. Sec. 163 (right to strike).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also apparent that Congress paid close attention to judicial precedent in private sector labor law when drafting the statute.&#x2003;The administrative practice pursuant to the 1978 Act does not provide clear guidance on midterm proposals in the public sector. <span class="Italic">Compare Library of Congress,</span> 9 F.L.R.A. 427 (1982) with <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 16 F.L.R.A. 602 (1984). In the private sector, however, there is clear and long-established precedent that the duty to bargain extends also to midterm proposals initiated by either management or labor, provided the proposals do not conflict with the existing agreement. This basic principle of private sector labor law was applied in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Jacobs Manufacturing Co.,</span> 196 F.2d 680, 684 (2d Cir. 1952).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the <span class="Italic">Jacobs Manufacturing </span>case, the question presented was whether management, during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement, had a duty to bargain as to matters neither discussed nor incorporated into that agreement. The union sought to have the company ordered to bargain as to subjects not covered by the agreement. The Jacobs Manufacturing Company contended that it had no duty to bargain during the term of the agreement as to subjects not covered in the agreement, since they had not been reserved for future negotiations in a reopening clause. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 683. The NLRB concluded that there was a duty to bargain, and held that management's unwillingness to meet with labor on those issues constituted a refusal to bargain in good faith in violation of section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 196 F.2d at 682-83. Hence, the NLRB ordered that the company bargain collectively with the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the NLRB's petition for enforcement of its order, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the NLRB, and granted enforcement. The court stated that defendant's narrow interpretation of section 8(d) was inconsistent with the general purpose of the Act, which is "to require employers to bargain as to employee demands whenever made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 684. Hence, the court held that the employer had a duty "to bargain as to subjects which were neither discussed nor embodied in any of the terms and conditions of the contract." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Each court of appeals that has addressed this issue has relied on the Second Circuit's analysis in the <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mead Corp. v. NLRB,</span> 697 F.2d 1013, 1020 (11th Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">NL Industries v. NLRB,</span> 536 F.2d 786, 789-90 (8th Cir. 1976). Indeed, it is undisputed that the <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> case is fully integrated into the fabric of labor law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevance or applicability of private sector labor law to the law of the public sector may vary with the specific issues raised.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Library of Congress v. FLRA,</span> 699 F.2d 1280, 1287 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In this case, the Authority identified no practical distinctions between private and governmental needs as to midterm bargaining. As this Court has explained, "[t]he lack of any prior judicial decisions under the [FLRS], especially when combined with the relative paucity of applicable legislative history, makes analogies to comparable legal developments in the private sector relevant and useful as a guide for this court's reasoning." <span class="Italic">Library of Congress,</span> 699 F.2d at 1286; <span class="Italic">see Department of Defense v. FLRA,</span> 659 F.2d 1140, 1144 (D.C. Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom.</span> 455 U.S. 945, 102 S. Ct. 1443, 71 L. Ed.2d 658 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This interpretation of the governing statute is consistent with its purposes and framework.&#x2003;It promotes and encourages equitable collective bargaining, and is coupled with specific restrictions to accommodate the government's unique labor relations needs. There is no doubt that private sector analogies to cases arising under the FLRA must be undertaken with care. <span class="Italic">See Library of Congress,</span> 699 F.2d at 1281. Nevertheless, the well established precedent of the Jacobs case should have been seriously considered by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">THE PURPOSE AND GOALS OF THE STATUTE</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In enacting the FLRS, Congress determined that, "experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their choosing in decisions which affect them...contributes to the effective conduct of public business." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101(a)(1) (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its administrative decisions, and in its brief before this Court, the Authority urges that its position is supported by the legislative directive to interpret the statute to promote "effective and efficient government." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101(b) (1982). The Authority reasoned that midterm bargaining over union proposals would inject uncertainty into labor-management relations, undermine stability in the workplace, and increase the prospect for conflict. Congress, however, has already drawn the opposite conclusion, and has determined that collective bargaining contributes to stability in federal labor-management relations, and to effective and efficient government. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7101(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that Congress had determined that collective bargaining contributes to stability in federal labor-management relations, and to effective government. <span class="Italic">See IRS v. National Treasury Employees Union,</span> 17 F.L.R.A. 731, 735-36 (1985). More importantly, the FLRA indicated that Congress had authorized management-initiated midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The FLRA's decision in this case was unreasonable because management-initiated midterm proposals would create the identical potential problems that the Authority feared would arise from union-initiated midterm proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This Court has recognized the statutory "goal of equalizing the positions of labor and management at the bargaining table." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA,</span> 750 F.2d 143, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (AFGE). As the Supreme Court emphasized in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>: "In passing the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress unquestionably intended to strengthen the position of federal unions and to make the collective-bargaining process a more effective instrument of the public interest...." 464 U.S. at 107, 104 S. Ct. at 449. Congress, of course, recognized that the special needs of government required certain protections for management in the collective-bargaining process. There is no indication, however, that the restriction on the duty to bargain imposed by the Authority in this case is an appropriate means of furthering the statutory goals. Indeed, the statutory scheme protects governmental needs, not by restricting <span id="Page_1226"></span>the circumstances of bargaining, but by limiting the areas that are subject to bargaining. For example, section 7106(a) enumerates certain management rights which are not subject to bargaining. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7106(a) (1982). Similarly, section 7106(b) sets forth permissive bargaining areas which are subject to negotiation only if management consents. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7106(b) (1982). These protections operate throughout the bargaining process, without regard to whether the negotiation is local or national, a union proposal or a management proposal, or a midterm or basic agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the absence of any statutory distinction between midterm and basic negotiations, it is clear that Congress intended that management prerogatives be preserved through this comprehensive system of subject matter protection, rather than through implied restrictions on the collective-bargaining process. Nevertheless, the Authority asserts that a distinction must be made between midterm and other agreements because midterm bargaining would undermine reliance on the basic agreement, and encourage fragmentation of the collective-bargaining process. At the same time, the Authority has clearly announced its understanding that employee representatives must bargain over all lawful midterm proposals by management, not only those required by law or within the statute's explicit management rights. There is nothing inherently threatening to management prerogatives, however, in allowing midterm bargaining by the union. To allow management to retain the right to raise new issues, but to deny that right to the employees' representatives would produce an inequality in bargaining power without express statutory support or strong policy justification. To limit the right of the union in midterm bargaining would provide management with an unwarranted advantage which would violate a guiding purpose of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the clear precedent in the private sector on the specific issue presented, the express congressional intent to promote and encourage collective bargaining, and basic principles of labor law, the Court holds that the decisions of the Authority are contrary to the intent of the legislature and the guiding purpose of the statute. Therefore, since the decisions are "not in accordance with law,"<span class="Italic"> see </span>5 U.S.C. Sec. 706(2)(A), they are set aside, and the case is remanded.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, FLRA determined in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 29 FLRA 162, 165-67 (1987), that midterm bargaining was appropriate unless it was waived either through the existence of a "zipper" clause or through a demonstration that the subject matter of the midterm bargaining was fully explored and discussed during negotiations leading to the parties' contract:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the court, we find that express Congressional intent to promote and expand collective bargaining in the Federal service is advanced by permitting labor organizations in certain circumstances to initiate bargaining during the term of a collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, we agree that the goal of providing more equality in the positions of unions and agencies at the bargaining table likewise is promoted by requiring bargaining on union-initiated, mid-term proposals in some circumstances....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first category of waiver, a union may contractually agree to waive its right to initiate bargaining in general by a "zipper clause," that is, a clause intended to waive the obligation to bargain during the term of the agreement on matters not contained in the agreement. Or, a union may waive its right to initiate bargaining over a particular subject matter. In determining whether a contract provision constitutes a clear and unmistakable waiver of the union's right to initiate bargaining, we will examine the wording of the provision as well as other relevant provisions of the contract, bargaining history, and past practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second category of waiver, clear and unmistakable waiver as evidenced by bargaining history, concerns subject matters which were discussed in contract negotiations but which were not specifically covered in the resulting contract. In this category, waiver may be found, based on a case-by-case analysis of the facts and circumstances of each case, where the subject matter of the proposal offered by the union during mid-term negotiations was fully discussed and explored by the parties at the bargaining table. For example, where a union sought to bargain over a subject matter but later withdrew its proposal in exchange for another provision, a waiver of the union's right to bargain over the subject matter which was withdrawn would be found. The particular words of proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations need not be identical for a waiver to exist. On the other hand, the fact that a mid-term proposal may relate to a general subject area covered in a collective bargaining agreement will not relieve an agency of its obligation to bargain. Rather, the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations is the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we conclude that the duty to bargain in good faith imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union-initiated proposals concerning matters which are not addressed in the agreement and were not clearly and unmistakably waived by the union during negotiation of the agreement. Previous Authority decisions not consistent with this conclusion will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record reflects that the matters addressed in the Union's mid-term proposals were not covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreements. Moreover, as determined by the Judge, 17 FLRA 746-48, the record does not support the Respondent's contentions that the Union agreed to "zipper clauses" in the agreements or that the Union's proposals were fully discussed during the negotiations that led to the agreements. The Judge found that there was an absence of essential details of the parties' discussions and that the only thing that could be concluded on the basis of the record evidence is that the Union submitted some proposals which for some unexplained reason were not included in the parties' subsequent collective bargaining agreements. In these circumstances, we agree with the Judge that the Union did not clearly and unmistakably waive its right to bargain on its mid-term proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent">The change in FLRA's position after the D.C. Circuit 1987 decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> was reflected in a Corps of Engineers case. The issue arose in <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City and NFFE Local 29</span>, 19 FLRA 192 (1985), of how to rate an employee who was on 100% official time for representational responsibilities. FLRA would not consider the issue in the context of a refusal to bargain charge, stemming from the employer's refusal to rate the employee, because the contract covered appraisal procedures and there was no evidence that the employer was changing any practice. Although the problem did not arise before, FLRA apparently concluded that the refusal to rate the employee because of union activities did not establish a change in past practice triggering an obligation to bargain at midterm. The <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29</span> case was remanded to FLRA for reconsideration,<span class="Italic"> NFFE Local 29 v. FLRA</span>, No. 85-1588 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 19, 1987), consolidated order in <span class="Italic">NAGE Locals R14-68, 71, 73 and 96 v. FLRA</span>, No. 85-1463 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 19, 1987), for proceedings consistent with its decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, the <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29</span> proposal was determined to be negotiable in <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City and NFFE Local 29</span>, 31 FLRA 1231, 1232 (1988), essentially integrating the "covered by" doctrine with a waiver analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the term of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Union requested the Respondent to bargain about procedures to be used to rate unit employees who did not receive annual performance appraisals because they had not performed work duties for 120 days due to extensive amounts of official time for representational duties during the appraisal period. The request resulted from the Respondent's refusal to rate a unit employee who had served as a steward for nearly 100 percent of her work time during a rating period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement contained a "reopener" provision that allowed negotiations on certain matters at the "mid-term date of this contract." The Union requested bargaining on April 26, 1983, several months after the January 1983 "mid-term" of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that the rating procedures at issue were not considered or discussed during negotiations for their collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the court's remand here as well as our Decision on Remand in Internal Revenue Service, the Respondent had a duty to bargain over a negotiable proposal regarding appraisal procedures unless (1) the matter is covered by the parties' agreement or (2) the Union clearly and unmistakably waived its right to bargain. A waiver of the Union's right to bargain may be established by express agreement or by bargaining history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, as explained below, that the matter is not covered by the parties' agreement and that a clear and unmistakable waiver has not been established. Therefore, we conclude that the Respondent violated sections 7116(a)(1) and (5), as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A. The Matter is Not Covered by the Parties' Agreement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that the following provisions of the parties' supplemental agreement cover the matter about which the Union sought to negotiate:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">K. (AR 690-400.430.3-2f (1)) A rating will be postponed when (a) a newly assigned supervisor has had less than 120 days to observe the employee's performance against current requirements; or (b) an employee's performance has been temporarily marginal or unsatisfactory (e.g., due to illness, alcoholism, or drug abuse) and the performance shows evidence of improvement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q. (AR 690-400.430.3-2c(1)) Annual appraisals will be prepared for each employee at least one [sic] during each 12 month period. Appraisals will normally be completed during the first 25 days following the end of the rating period. Appraisals will be considered delinquent after the forty-fifth day following the end of the rating period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1227"></span>T. (AR 690-400.430.2-4d and 3-2g (2)) Rating supervisors will be individuals who have administrative authority to properly rate employees and who have personally observed the employee's performance for an extended period of time, i.e., 120 days. When the rating supervisor is not available (e.g., Extended illness, Death, or Sudden Resignation), the next higher level supervisor will prepare the appraisal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that these sections of the supplemental agreement do not address the particular subject matter of the Union's bargaining request. Section K deals with ratings where a new supervisor has not had time to observe an employee or where an employee's performance temporarily has been marginal or unsatisfactory. Section Q requires annual appraisals. Section T concerns "rating supervisors" and situations where those supervisors are not available.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These sections of the supplementary agreement address the same general subject area--performance appraisals--as the subject of the Union's request. However, these sections do not in any way address procedures for rating an employee who was on official time for extensive periods during the rating period. In our Decision and Order on Remand in Internal Revenue Service, 29 FLRA at 167, we addressed the similarity which must exist between mid-term proposals and matters which are covered in a collective bargaining agreement in order to establish a waiver by bargaining history. We stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The particular words of proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations need not be identical for a waiver to exist. On the other hand, the fact that a mid-term proposal may relate to a general subject area covered in a collective bargaining agreement will not relieve an agency of its obligation to bargain. Rather, the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations is the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no reason to apply a different standard to determine whether a matter is covered by the parties' agreement than is applied to determine whether a waiver by bargaining history has been established. Accordingly, our examination of the sections of the parties' supplementary agreement is limited to determining whether the agreement covers the particular subject matter of the Union's bargaining request. That particular subject matter--appraisal procedures for unit employees who used extensive amounts of official time during the rating period--clearly is not covered by the supplementary agreement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the Union sought to bargain over matters which were already contained in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B&#x2003;The Union Did Not Waive Its Right to Bargain</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a union may waive its statutory right to bargain about conditions of employment, such a waiver must be clear and unmistakable. Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, 5 FLRA 9 (1981). <span class="Italic">See also Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 460 U.S. 693, 708 (1983). In our Decision and Order on Remand in Internal Revenue Service, 29 FLRA at 166, we held that a waiver of a union's right to initiate mid-term bargaining over matters which are not covered in the parties' agreement may be established by (1) express agreement, or (2) bargaining history. We stated the following about these two types of waivers:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As to the first category of waiver, a union may contractually agree to waive its right to initiate bargaining in general by a "zipper clause," that is, a clause intended to waive the obligation to bargain during the term of the agreement on matters not contained in the agreement. Or, a union may waive its right to initiate bargaining over a particular subject matter. In determining whether a contract provision constitutes a clear and unmistakable waiver...we will examine the wording of the provision as well as other relevant provisions of the contract, bargaining history, and past practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The second category of waiver, clear and unmistakable waiver as evidenced by bargaining history, concerns subject matters which were discussed in contract negotiations but which were not specifically covered in the resulting contract. In this category, waiver may be found...where the subject matter of the proposal offered by the union during mid-term negotiations was fully discussed and explored by the parties at the bargaining table.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 166-67.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we conclude that the Union did not waive its right to bargain in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;There is No Express Waiver</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 28, Section 2 of the parties' existing collective bargaining agreement provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2. Amendments and Supplements. This agreement may be amended and/or supplemented as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;At mid-term date of this contract under the provisions of the articles entitled "Negotiations" and "Union Rights and Representation."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;Within a reasonable time after the enactment of any new law or regulation of appropriate authority which affects the provisions of this Agreement. A proposal by either party to negotiate such amendment(s) or supplement(s) shall cite the pertinent law or regulation and the article(s) of this Agreement affected. When such a proposal is submitted, representatives of the Employer and the Union shall meet within a reasonable time, normally within fifteen (15) calendar days to negotiate the requested amendment(s) or supplement(s).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this "reopener" provision is not a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Union's right to negotiate over the appraisal procedures involved in this case. It provides only that the agreement may be reopened for amendment and/or supplementation at a mid-term date, and after enactment of a new law or regulation "which affects the provisions of this Agreement." The provision does not address the circumstance giving rise to the bargaining request here. Further, the provision does not state that it provides the exclusive conditions under which the agreement may be reopened. Therefore, we find that the reopener provision does not constitute an express waiver of the Union's bargaining rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;There is No Waiver by Bargaining History</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that "at no time during the negotiations for the parties' collective bargaining agreement" did the parties "discuss, consider, and/or negotiate" over the subject matter of the Union's bargaining request. Consistent with this stipulation, we find that the subject matter of the Union's bargaining request was not "fully discussed and explored at the bargaining table." <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 29 FLRA at 167. <span class="Italic">See generally Suffolk Child Development Center, Inc.</span>, 277 NLRB 1345, 1350 (1985). Therefore, there is no waiver by bargaining history in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Summary</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The particular subject matter of the Union's bargaining request is not covered by the parties' agreement and the Union did not otherwise clearly and unmistakably waive its right to bargain. Therefore, we conclude that by refusing to bargain, the Respondent violated sections 7116(a)(1) and (5), and we shall order an appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was summarized in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 38 FLRA 1374, 1381-84 (1991), rejecting a waiver theory and deciding that a proposal was not precluded as a subject of midterm bargaining since the specific subject matter of the proposal was not specifically covered by the contract and was not previously bargained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Respondent Has a Duty to Bargain over the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement Does Not Preclude Bargaining Over the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service,</span> 29 FLRA 162 (1987), the Authority concluded that "the duty to bargain in good faith imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals <span class="Italic">concerning matters which are not contained in the agreement</span> unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved." 29 FLRA at 166 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Kansas City, Missouri,</span> 31 FLRA 1231 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Kansas City District</span>), the Authority discussed the standard to be applied in determining whether a matter proposed for mid-term bargaining is "contained in" the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In...<span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service,</span> 29 FLRA at 167, we addressed the similarity which must exist between mid-term proposals and matters which are covered in a collective bargaining agreement in order to establish a waiver by bargaining history. We stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">The particular words of proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations need not be identical for a waiver to exist. On the other hand, the fact that a mid-term proposal may relate to a general subject area covered in a collective bargaining agreement will not relieve an agency of its obligation to bargain. Rather, the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations is the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find no reason to apply a different standard to determine whether a matter is covered by the parties' agreement than is applied to determine whether a waiver by bargaining history has been established. Accordingly, our examination of the sections of the parties'...agreement is limited to determining whether the agreement covers the particular subject matter of the [u]nion's bargaining request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">31 FLRA at 1235-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the particular subject matter over which the Union seeks to negotiate in this case is contained in provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and whether, therefore, by virtue of bargaining history, the Union has waived its right to bargain over that subject matter, we first consider Article 9 of the parties' agreement. <span id="Page_1228"></span>Article 9 is entitled "Use of Official Facilities." It provides, among other things, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the Respondent "agrees to provide [the Union] the use of space on official bulletin boards which management has on its premises" (Section 1);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;the Union "may distribute material on the [Respondent's] premises" in specified circumstances (Section 2(A));</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;the Respondent "agrees to distribute notices and circulars sponsored by the [Union] to all designated employees in the bargaining unit, to be sent along with regular, departmental distributions" (Section 2(B));</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;on request of the Union, the Respondent "will provide meeting space for meetings of bargaining unit employees" (Section 4);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;the Union "shall have access to the Federal Telecommunications System...[or] the commercial telephone system for the conduct of labor-management relations business" (Section 5); and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;the Respondent agrees to provide the Union with file cabinets and office space (Sections 8 and 9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, Article 9 of the parties' agreement details various ways in which the Union may use the Respondent's facilities and services to distribute information and otherwise communicate with bargaining unit employees. Article 9 does not address the use of leave and earnings statements, and the parties stipulated that they had not bargained in the past over the use of such statements to communicate messages to unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">Kansas City District,</span> in which the union sought to negotiate over appraisal procedures for unit employees who used extensive amounts of official time during the rating period. The Authority found that the particular subject matter of the union's proposal was not covered by the provisions of the parties' agreement dealing generally with performance appraisals. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that the respondent was obligated to bargain over the union's proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we conclude that the above-described sections of the parties' collective agreement do not specifically address the particular subject matter of the Union's bargaining request. While the provisions in Article 9 deal with various communications with bargaining unit employees, Article 9 does not specifically address the subject matter of the Union's bargaining request, the ability of the Union to determine the content of the messages on 13 of 26 biweekly leave and earnings statements. Therefore, the matter as to which the Union sought to bargain was not contained in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, therefore, that the Union did not, either expressly or through bargaining history, waive its right to initiate bargaining over the disputed proposal. It is clear, in this regard, that a union may contractually agree to a waiver of its right to initiate mid-term bargaining, either in general or as to a specific subject matter or matters, during the term of an agreement. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span> at 166. Such a waiver of bargaining rights may be established by express agreement or bargaining history. Any such waiver must be clear and unmistakable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> and note 4. In determining whether a contract provision constitutes a clear and unmistakable waiver, we examine the wording of the provision as well as other relevant contractual provisions, bargaining history, and past practice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As noted, a waiver may be evidenced by the parties' bargaining history. For example, where a union sought to bargain over a particular subject matter but withdrew its proposal in exchange for another provision, a waiver by bargaining history could be found. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 167. <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps (MPL), Washington, D.C. and Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia,</span> 38 FLRA 632 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, there is no evidence in the record or argument by the Respondent that Article 9 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement constitutes a clear and unmistakable waiver of the Union's right to negotiate over the content of the messages printed on employee leave and earnings statements. Further, as noted above, the parties stipulated that "[w]ith respect to earnings and leave statements, there were no proposals or discussions concerning the content of messages to employees during any past contract negotiations between the parties." Consistent with this stipulation, we find that the subject matter of the Union's bargaining request was not "fully discussed and explored at the bargaining table." <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span> at 167. Accordingly, we find that the parties' bargaining history does not evidence a waiver of the Union's right to bargain over the proposal in this case. Therefore, the Union did not waive its right to bargain in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1992, the Fourth Circuit parted company with the D.C. Circuit and denied enforcement of a midterm bargaining order in an opinion that determined FLRA's initial rejection of midterm bargaining requirements was correct, <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1280, 1281-89 (4th Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case we must decide a question relating to the duty of federal agencies to bargain with unions that represent federal workers.&#x2003;The Federal Labor Relations Authority held that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., requires federal agencies to conduct union-initiated midterm bargaining over issues not addressed by the applicable collective bargaining agreement. We conclude that union-initiated midterm bargaining is not required by the statute and would undermine the congressional policies underlying the statute. We therefore set aside the Authority's decision and deny its cross-application for enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Union-initiated midterm bargaining risks serious interference with this most basic of statutory objectives....&#8197;[P]ermitting union-initiated midterm bargaining "would encourage dispersal of the collective bargaining process" and thereby result in seriatim midterm bargaining--and then seriatim FSIP arbitration--over individual issues raised midterm....&#8197;Such an approach to federal-sector labor relations would "enhance the prospect for protracted conflict" that undermines an agency's effectiveness and would result in "the continuous expenditure of resources for both management and [union] representatives."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA now responds to these concerns by suggesting that the two exceptions it has crafted to union-initiated midterm bargaining allow agencies to mitigate these considerations. First, the FLRA asserts that agency management can avoid the deleterious effects of midterm bargaining on an agency's effectiveness and efficiency simply by negotiating a union waiver, in a so-called zipper clause, of the union's right to negotiate midterm apart from impact and implementation issues....&#8197;Negotiated waivers, however, are not an adequate solution to the problem. Neither the FLRA nor any court has resolved the question whether such waivers are mandatory subjects of bargaining that an agency may negotiate to impasse. If waiver clauses are only permissive subjects of negotiation, an agency would be denied access to FSIP arbitration over a union's refusal to accept such a clause in the basic labor contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More fundamentally, the FLRA's approach to zipper clauses ensures the very uncertainty and litigiousness the FLRA asserts they would allow an agency to avoid. The FLRA interprets zipper clauses as waivers of employees' statutory rights that must be shown to be "clear and unmistakable."...According to the FLRA, application of this standard requires inquiry into "the wording of the provision[,]...other relevant provisions of the contract, bargaining history, and past practice."...Because determinations as to whether a waiver is "clear and unmistakable" are made on a case-by-case basis...an agency will often be unsure whether the FLRA will, in fact, find a particular contractual provision to be an adequate waiver....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second posited exception to union-initiated midterm bargaining is that an agency need not negotiate over matters "contained in," <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, 29 FLRA at 166, or "covered by," <span class="Italic">Missouri Nat'l Guard, Office of the Adjutant General</span>, 31 FLRA 1244, 1247 (1988), the basic collective bargaining agreement. This exception, however, has no warrant in the language of the statute. Although the FLRA indicated in its brief that the law of midterm bargaining established in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> is "just like" that governing midterm bargaining in the private sector, the FSLMRS is not "just like" the NLRA for these purposes. As discussed above, NLRA &#x00A7; 8(d) expressly exempts from midterm bargaining subjects "contained in" a basic labor contract, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 158(d), but the FSLMRS does not contain a comparable provision....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he absence of midterm bargaining will not undercut the statutory commitment to collective bargaining as a basic means of resolving workplace disputes. Any issue that a union wishes to raise can be advanced in the course of negotiating a comprehensive agreement, and issues initially overlooked can be brought up whenever the agreement is renegotiated.</p>
<p class="noindent">More litigation in the courts ensued on the midterm bargaining issue. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE</span>, 39 FLRA 1060 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 51-53 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post,</span> offered a synopsis of FLRA guidance in a decision examining the effect that negotiated provisions concerning the procedures aspects of details had on midterm proposals concerning more substantive aspects of details, including their impact. Bargaining was not waived, 39 FLRA at 1066-67:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District</span>, 31 FLRA at 1235-36, we stated that we will determine whether a matter is covered by a collective bargaining agreement by using the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 29 FLRA at 167:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The particular words of proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations need not be identical for a waiver to exist. On the other hand, the fact that a mid-term proposal may relate to a general subject area covered in a collective bargaining agreement will not relieve an agency of its obligation to bargain. Rather, the determinative factor is whether the particular subject matter of the <span id="Page_1229"></span>proposals offered during contract and mid-term negotiations is the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1374, 1382 (1991). (<span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the proper approach in this case is to determine whether the MLA specifically addresses the impact and implementation of employee details, the particular subject matter of the Union's bargaining request, to determine whether the matter as to which the Union sought to bargain is contained in the parties' agreement.<span class="Italic"> See U.S. Department of Labor</span>, 38 FLRA at 1383.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of mid-term bargaining preclusion was not over. In 1992, the D.C. Circuit reversed FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Base Albany</span> as well as in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 39 FLRA 1126 (1991). The court determined that once a matter was the subject of general bargaining, impact bargaining as to that matter was waived. There was a limit to the specificity required in a contract to accomplish the waiver. Judge Edwards, writing for the D.C. Circuit, explained the result reached by that court in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 49-62 (D.C. Cir. 1992), distinguishing between waiver of a right to bargain and the exercise of a bargaining right through definition of actions "covered by" an agreement, leaving it to FLRA to determine a better "covered by" analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question presented in this case is whether an agency, which has reached agreement with a union regarding the procedures to be followed in exercising a management right, and has memorialized the agreed-upon procedures in a collective bargaining agreement, must nonetheless bargain with the union anew when it takes action pursuant to the agreement. The Federal Labor Relations Authority answered this question in the affirmative. We reverse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1987, the United States Marine Corps ("Marine Corps") reassigned several employees at its Albany, Georgia, facility to temporary duties and established new performance standards for certain employees at its Barstow, California, facility. Because both actions were taken pursuant to contractual authority, the Marine Corps refused to engage in any further "impact and implementation" bargaining with union representatives before effecting the reassignments and the new performance standards. The Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "Authority") held that the agency had committed unfair labor practices by failing to consult and bargain with the union over the disputed actions, even though the applicable collective bargaining agreement contained provisions covering the implementation of both actions, and the Marine Corps had followed the procedures prescribed by the agreement. Rejecting the Marine Corps' contention that it had no duty to bargain because the impact and implementation matters at issue were "covered by" the collective bargaining agreement, the Authority held that bargaining was required because the agreement did not "clearly and unmistakably waive" the union's bargaining right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal.</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. 1126 (1991) ("<span class="Italic">Barstow</span>"); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. 1060 (1991) ("<span class="Italic">Albany</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold that the Authority committed legal error in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span> by improperly equating the question of whether the disputed agency actions were "covered by" the collective bargaining agreement with the question of whether the union had waived its right to bargain. A <span class="Italic">waiver</span> occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes its right to bargain over a matter; but where the matter is <span class="Italic">covered by</span> a collective bargaining agreement, the union has exercised its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant. The Authority properly recognized that there is no duty to bargain over matters "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement; since the reassignments at the Albany, Georgia, facility and the implementation of performance standards at the Barstow, California, facility were "covered by" the parties' collective bargaining agreement, neither matter should have been subject to further bargaining except upon mutual consent. The Authority, however, avoided this result by purporting to rely on a "waiver" analysis, pursuant to which "covered by" is defined so narrowly that bargaining always will be required. By adopting this flawed approach, the Authority departed from its own prior cases and the private sector principles upon which it purported to rely; it also reached results at odds with both the governing statute and common sense. Accordingly, we reverse the Authority's decisions in both cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although an agency is not required to bargain with respect to its management rights <span class="Italic">per se</span>, it is required to negotiate about the "impact and implementation" of those rights--that is, the "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising" management rights and "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise" of such rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), (3); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force v.

The FSLMRS also requires agencies to consult with employee unions before implementing "any substantive change in conditions of employment proposed by the agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(d)(2)(A).

<p class="noindent-1">The cases at bar concern duty to bargain disputes between the Marine Corps and the American Federation of Government Employees ("AFGE"), which is the recognized bargaining representative of certain civilian employees at the Marine Corps' Albany, Georgia, and Barstow, California, facilities. The relationship between the Marine Corps and the AFGE is governed by a collective bargaining agreement called the Master Labor Agreement ("MLA"). The MLA establishes a grievance procedure to resolve disputes over the interpretation of the agreement and contains an "integration" clause which provides that the MLA constitutes the "total agreement" between the parties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MLA sets forth procedures governing the exercise of certain management rights, including the temporary reassignment ("detailing") of employees and the establishment of performance standards. The disputes underlying the instant petitions for review arose when the Marine Corps decided to "detail" four employees at its Albany facility and to modify the performance criteria applicable to certain employees at its Barstow facility. The AFGE requested consultation and "impact and implementation" bargaining with respect to both decisions, but the Marine Corps refused.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition No. 91-1211 (Albany, Georgia)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 16 of the MLA governs the "detailing" of employees. It provides that an employee's duties may be changed in order to "meet[&#8197;] temporary needs...when necessary services cannot be obtained by other desirable or practical means"; the reassignment may be to a higher or lower grade level, or to a set of duties that has not yet been classified. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Albany</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1077 n.1 (ALJ Decision) (reprinting Article 16). Article 16 also places limits upon the duration of a "detail" and addresses certain procedural matters relevant to the implementation of details, including how details must be documented, when details will result in temporary promotions, when competitive procedures must be used and how deductions of union dues will be handled for detailed employees....&#8197;Disputes arising from management decisions to detail employees are subject to the grievance procedure contained in Article 13 of the MLA....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May 1987, the management of the Marine Corps facility at Albany, Georgia, decided to reassign four employees in order to address an unexpected need for vehicle maintenance services. Two "automotive repair inspectors" and two "mobile equipment servicers" were "detailed" to assist the facility's regular auto mechanics for a period of 120 days. Although none of the reassigned employees suffered a reduction in pay, their new work was less desirable than their former duties. The Marine Corps informed the union steward at the facility of the reassignment decision on the day that it took effect. The AFGE subsequently requested bargaining with the Marine Corps over the impact of the reassignment on the four affected employees. The Marine Corps refused, asserting that it had no bargaining obligation because it had complied with the procedures contained in Article 16 of the MLA. In June 1987, the AFGE filed an unfair labor practice charge, asserting that the Marine Corps had violated its statutory duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 31, 1988, an Administrative Law Judge issued a decision in the union's favor. The ALJ reached this result by applying a <span class="Italic">waiver</span> analysis. He began by finding that the temporary reassignment of the four employees constituted a change in their conditions of employment in that the new assignments were less desirable and might prejudice the employees' prospects for promotion; because this change was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, the ALJ reasoned, the Marine Corps was required to bargain about the change unless the union had waived its right to bargain....&#8197;Turning to the language of Article 16, the ALJ found that the Article did not constitute a "clear and unmistakable" waiver of the AFGE's right to bargain about the impact and implementation of the decision to detail....&#8197;Having found the existence of a duty to bargain and no waiver by the union, the ALJ held that the Marine Corps had committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to negotiate with the AFGE....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal of the ALJ's decision, the Marine Corps' primary argument was that it had no obligation to bargain because it <span class="Italic">had bargained</span> over the impact and implementation of "detailing" during collective bargaining negotiations, with Article 16 being the result of that bargaining; as a result, the Marine Corps contended, the ALJ erred by analyzing the case in terms of waiver. The Authority rejected the Marine Corps' argument and affirmed the ALJ's decision, although on somewhat different grounds than those advanced by the ALJ....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority began its analysis by agreeing with the Marine Corps that if a matter that would otherwise be a mandatory subject of bargaining is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement, there is no further obligation on the part of either party to bargain about the matter during the <span id="Page_1230"></span>term of the agreement....&#8197;However, purportedly relying upon its decision in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 29 F.L.R.A. 162 (1987), the Authority proceeded to apply a very narrow test for determining when a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority will consider a negotiable matter to be covered by the agreement, and therefore to be removed from the area of required bargaining, if the <span class="Italic">particular subject matter of a union's bargaining request is specifically addressed in the negotiated agreement</span>. If the particular subject matter is not specifically addressed,...we then look to see whether the union nevertheless otherwise waived its right to engage in future bargaining about that subject.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Albany</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1065. Relying upon the ALJ's findings, the Authority held that the MLA did not "specifically address" the "particular subject matter" of the union's bargaining request--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the impact of the "detail" on the four affected employees--because the Agreement did not contain provisions regarding the "'implementation of <span class="Italic">individual details</span> on the local level.'"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority next turned to the question of whether the AFGE had "otherwise waived" its bargaining right. Applying the same "specifically addressed" standard set forth above, the FLRA found that Article 16 did not waive the union's right to bargain....&#8197;The Authority further concluded that neither the MLA's integration clause nor the parties' bargaining history effected a waiver of the AFGE's bargaining right....&#8197;Accordingly, the Authority held that the Marine Corps had violated the Statute and entered a bargaining order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Petition No. 90-1212 (Barstow, California)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 31 of the MLA governs the establishment of a "performance appraisal system" by the Marine Corps. It provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that: (1) management will establish "performance elements" and "performance standards"; (2) employees must be given the chance to participate in the establishment of performance standards; (3) employees must be given adequate notice of the standards that apply to them; (4) employees may propose changes in performance standards at any time; and (5) the standards established must be "fair and reasonable."...&#8197;Article 13 of the MLA subjects disputes regarding performance criteria to the MLA's grievance and arbitration procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In July 1987, the management of the Marine Corps' facility at Barstow, California, decided to modify the performance criteria applicable to some of its production employees. On July 31, 1987, supervisors held a meeting with the affected employees at which the proposed changes were discussed. The shop foreman subsequently met individually with each employee and solicited input regarding the new performance standards....&#8197;As the Authority acknowledges, these actions fully complied with the requirements of Article 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 7, 1987, the AFGE requested bargaining over the implementation of the new performance standards. The Marine Corps refused to bargain and, in November 1987, implemented the changes. The AFGE subsequently filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging that the Marine Corps had violated the Statute by changing the working conditions of unit employees without engaging in "impact and implementation" bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ALJ upheld the union's unfair labor practice charge in a decision issued on November 8, 1988. The ALJ first rejected the Marine Corps' contention that it had no duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of the new performance standards because that matter was "covered by" Article 31 of the MLA. Relying upon <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 609 (1986) ("<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>"), a waiver case, the ALJ concluded that Article 31 did not relieve the Marine Corps of its duty to bargain....&#8197;The ALJ then went on to find that the AFGE had not otherwise waived its right to engage in impact and implementation bargaining....&#8197;Based upon these findings, the ALJ held that the Marine Corps had violated the Statute by refusing to negotiate with the AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On administrative appeal, the FLRA affirmed the decision of the ALJ. <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1134. As in <span class="Italic">Albany</span>, the Authority rejected the Marine Corps' argument that the provisions of the MLA relieved it of its duty to bargain. Applying the narrow "covered by" test used in <span class="Italic">Albany</span>--which the Authority explicitly equated with the waiver standard of <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>--the Authority concluded that Article 31 of the MLA did not remove the agency's bargaining obligation because it did not "specifically address the full range of impact and implementation issues."...&#8197;Accordingly, the Authority ordered the Marine Corps to bargain with the AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Development of the Authority's "Covered By" Test</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's present test for determining when a mandatory bargaining subject is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement has its genesis in the Authority's 1985 decision in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 17 F.L.R.A. 731 (1985). There, the Authority held that, under the FSLMRS, agencies have no duty to bargain over union-initiated proposals during the term of a collective bargaining agreement....&#8197;The affected union petitioned for review, and this court vacated the Authority's decision. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>"). Based upon the FSLMRS's policy of promoting collective bargaining and the "clear precedent in the private sector," we rejected the Authority's conclusion that agencies have no mid-term duty to bargain with respect to union-initiated proposals....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Authority modified its prior position and concluded that the FSLMRS sometimes does require agencies to bargain over union-initiated proposals during the contract term. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Serv.</span>, 29 F.L.R.A. 162 (1987) ("<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>"). Relying upon the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and the relevant private sector precedents, the Authority held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he duty to bargain in good faith imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters <span class="Italic">which are not contained in the agreement</span> unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. Such a waiver of bargaining rights may be established by (1) express agreement, or (2) bargaining history. Further, any such waiver must be clear and unmistakable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 166 (emphasis added). Thus, under <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, mid-term bargaining can be avoided <span class="Italic">either</span> (1) when it concerns a matter <span class="Italic">contained in</span> an agreement or (2) when bargaining has been <span class="Italic">waived</span> by agreement or pursuant to the parties' bargaining history. In other words, "contained in" (or "covered by") and "waiver" are categorically distinct, and the "clear and unmistakable" test applies only to the latter ("waiver") category.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Following its decision in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, however, the Authority began to lose the doctrinal clarity that it exhibited in that decision. In <span class="Italic">United States Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 31 F.L.R.A. 1231 (1988) ("<span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>"), the Authority faced a duty to bargain case in which the union had advanced a proposal concerning the procedures used by the agency to determine employee performance ratings--a subject dealt with in the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The FLRA first addressed the agency's claim that it had no bargaining obligation because the subject matter of the union proposal was "covered by" the negotiated agreement. Noting that <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> had not defined the term "covered by," the Authority adopted, as the standard for determining when a matter is "covered by" a negotiated agreement, <span class="Italic">the same test used in</span> <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> <span class="Italic">to determine the existence of a waiver by bargaining history</span>...whether the relevant contractual provision specifically addresses the "particular subject matter" of the union's bargaining requests....&#8197;Applying this standard, the Authority went on to conclude, not surprisingly, that the subject matter of the union proposal in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span> was not "covered by" the collective bargaining agreement because the agreement did not "clearly and unmistakably waive" the union's right to bargain about performance ratings....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In essence, what the Authority did in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span> was to transform the two-part duty to bargain test of <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> into a one-part test by collapsing the "contained in"/"covered by" inquiry into the "waiver" inquiry. The Authority did this by applying, as the test for the "covered by" inquiry, the same test that it created in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> to determine the existence of a waiver by bargaining history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority applied its <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span> test for when a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement and determined that the impact and implementation matters raised by the AFGE were not "covered by" the MLA--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the provisions of the MLA did not evince a clear and unmistakable waiver of the union's right to bargain over those matters. Since its decisions in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority has continued to apply the "collapsed" version of the <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> test; indeed, in more recent cases, the Authority appears to have abandoned any pretense of a two-part inquiry and applied a pure waiver analysis. What has been missing, however, is any coherent or rational explanation in support of the FLRA's new approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Validity of the Authority's "Waiver" Approach to Duty to Bargain During the Term of an Agreement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Departure from Precedent</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established in this circuit that where an agency departs from its prior cases, it must offer a reasoned explanation for its change in view....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, under the rule of <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, whether an agency has a mid-term duty to bargain depends upon two <span class="Italic">separate</span> inquiries: whether the matter about which the union seeks to negotiate is "covered by" or "contained in" the collective bargaining agreement; and, if not, whether the union has <span id="Page_1231"></span>somehow relinquished its right to bargain. The "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard is relevant only to the <span class="Italic">second</span> inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The approach adopted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> is perfectly consistent with the FSLMRS, eminently reasonable and patently sensible. As the Authority noted, <span class="Italic">see</span> 29 F.L.R.A. at 166, the <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> approach is also consistent with private sector labor law, under which it is well-recognized that the parties to a collective bargaining agreement have no obligation to engage in midterm negotiation over subjects covered by the agreement....&#8197;Moreover, the <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> approach is consistent with the Authority's own longstanding view that an agency incurs no bargaining obligation when it takes action pursuant to a contractual provision that authorizes the action in question....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the cases at bar, the Authority departed from the approach adopted in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>. Relying upon its intervening decision in <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, the Authority conflated the two steps of the <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> analysis by applying, as the test for whether a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement, the same standard that it adopted in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> for determining when a union has <span class="Italic">waived</span> its right to negotiate through bargaining history....&#8197;The result of the Authority's action is the addition of a novel "specificity" requirement to the <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> "covered by" test--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, unless the collective bargaining agreement <span class="Italic">specifically addresses the precise matter at issue</span>, then that matter is not "covered by" the agreement and the agency may be compelled to bargain over the matter anew....&#8197;[T]his newly-engrafted specificity requirement produces absurd results that cannot be squared with the policies of the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Putting aside for the moment the flawed results produced by the Authority's new "covered by" test, we must also condemn the manner of its adoption, for the Authority has failed to advance <span class="Italic">any</span> reasoned justification for its abandonment of the analytical structure of <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Corps of Engineers</span>, the Authority explained its decision to conflate the "covered by" and "waiver" inquiries by stating, "We find no reason to apply a different standard to determine whether a matter is covered by the parties' agreement than is applied to determine whether a waiver by bargaining history has been established." 31 F.L.R.A. at 1235-36. But, as this court and others have recognized on numerous occasions, there <span class="Italic">is</span> a reason to apply a different standard--namely, that the "covered by" and "waiver" inquiries are analytically distinct. A waiver occurs when a union knowingly and voluntarily <span class="Italic">relinquishes</span> its right to bargain about a matter; but where the matter is covered by the collective bargaining agreement, the union <span class="Italic">has exercised</span> its bargaining right and the question of waiver is irrelevant. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Electrical Workers</span>, 927 F.2d at 641:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where the contract fully defines the parties' rights as to what would otherwise be a mandatory subject of bargaining, it is incorrect to say the union has "waived" its statutory right to bargain; rather, the contract will control and the "clear and unmistakable" intent standard is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the difference between the two concepts goes to the structural heart of labor law. When parties bargain about a subject and memorialize the results of their negotiation in a collective bargaining agreement, they create a set of enforceable rules--a new code of conduct for themselves--on that subject. Because of the fundamental policy of freedom of contract, the parties are generally free to agree to whatever specific rules they like, and in most circumstances it is beyond the competence of the Authority, the National Labor Relations Board or the courts to interfere with the parties' choice....&#8197;On the other hand, when a union <span class="Italic">waives</span> its right to bargain about a particular matter, it surrenders the opportunity to create a set of contractual rules that bind the employer, and instead cedes full discretion to the employer on that matter. For that reason, the courts require "clear and unmistakable" evidence of waiver and have tended to construe waivers narrowly....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analytical approach applied by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span> completely fails to take account of the fundamental distinction between the exercise of the right to bargain and the waiver of that right, a distinction which the Authority itself recognized in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>. Because this failure is unexplained--and, indeed, inexplicable--the Authority's decisions cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Policies of the FSLMRS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to constituting an unexplained departure from the sensible analytical method adopted in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, the "waiver" approach applied by the Authority in the cases at bar produces perverse and illogical results that cannot be squared with the policies of the FSLMRS. This circumstance provides a second ground upon which the Authority's decisions must be reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin our analysis of this issue by clarifying what is not in dispute in this case.&#x2003;In its decisions in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, and again at oral argument, the Authority made three critical concessions. First, the Authority concedes that the statutory right at issue in this case--the AFGE's right to engage in "impact and implementation" bargaining regarding employee work assignments and performance standards--is a right about which parties may legally bargain and which may be incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement. In other words, the Authority makes no claim that it was improper for the Marine Corps and the AFGE to bargain with respect to the impact and implementation matters at issue in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, or that those matters were somehow incapable of being "covered by" the resulting collective bargaining agreement. Second, the Authority concedes that where a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement, neither party has any obligation to engage in further bargaining with respect to that matter during the term of the agreement. Finally, the Authority acknowledges that the parties to a bargaining relationship may resolve disputes over impact, implementation and consultation as they see fit. In other words, there is no statutory prescription defining what the results of "impact and implementation" bargaining must be; the parties may agree on extensive consultation and mitigation procedures, modest procedures or even no procedures at all. Indeed, bargaining parties may legally agree on precisely what the Marine Corps and the AFGE agreed upon in Articles 16 and 31 of the MLA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite its recognition of these principles, the Authority applied an analytical approach in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span> which nullifies them. Under the "waiver" approach applied in those cases, a matter is not "covered by" a negotiated agreement unless the agreement "specifically addresses" the "particular subject matter" at issue. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Albany</span>, the Authority rejected the Marine Corps' contention that the impact and implementation of "detailing" were covered by the MLA because Article 16 of the Agreement "did not contain the <span class="Italic">whole 'universe' of possible conditions</span> that might pertain to the impact and implementation of employee details" and "did not 'even attempt to deal with the impact and implementation of <span class="Italic">specific individual details</span>.'" 39 F.L.R.A. at 1069 (quoting ALJ Decision). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority concluded that the implementation of performance standards was not covered by the MLA because Article 31 "does not specifically address <span class="Italic">the full range</span> of impact and implementation issues." 39 F.L.R.A. at 1133 (<span class="Italic">emphasis added</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The rather obvious problem with the Authority's "covered by" test is that it is, in practice, impossible to meet. Surely it would have required near-supernatural prescience for the parties to have foreseen, at the time of drafting the MLA, what implementation issues would arise with respect to "specific individual details" that had not even been conceived, much less implemented, at the time. Nor could any mortal drafter anticipate, perhaps months or years in advance, the "full range of impact and implementation issues" that could arise from an as yet unforeseen modification of performance standards....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, having recognized that there is no duty to bargain about matters covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority, applying its "waiver" approach, has defined "covered by" so narrowly that bargaining will always be required. As the Marine Corps points out, the effect of the Authority's flawed approach is to make the collective bargaining agreement merely "the starting point for constant negotiations over every agency action."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's approach is not only illogical but also impermissible, because it contravenes the policies of the FSLMRS. A primary purpose of the Statute is to promote collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2) (establishing right of employees "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4) (requiring agency and union to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purpose[&#8197;] of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement"). Implicit in this statutory purpose is the need to provide the parties to such an agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement. As the Authority itself recognized in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 17 F.L.R.A. at 734, "[T]o the extent that the parties are required to adhere to the specific conditions of employment mutually established in their agreement during the life of such agreement, stability at the work place is thereby fostered."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's "waiver" approach to the "covered by" inquiry subverts the statutory policies of contractual stability and repose by requiring essentially endless bargaining....&#8197;Such a result creates a disincentive to engage in collective bargaining and undermines contractual repose, thereby contravening the policies of the FSLMRS....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Worse still, the Authority's "waiver" approach effectively nullifies the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The FLRA acknowledges that the manner in which the MLA deals with employee "details" and performance standards is fully lawful. But the Authority's "waiver" approach robs the provisions covering those matters of all meaning because the Marine Corps is required to bargain anew regarding the same matters already addressed in the agreement. The agency thereby loses the benefit of its bargain with the AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fallacy in the Authority's position is most clearly demonstrated by considering what would have happened if the parties had never <span id="Page_1232"></span>bargained about the "detailing" of employees or the implementation of performance standards, so that the collective bargaining agreement contained no provisions on these matters. Had this occurred, and had the parties then engaged in midterm bargaining and reached agreement on provisions identical to those actually contained in Articles 16 and 31 of the MLA, no one would doubt that the Marine Corps had fulfilled its statutory duty to bargain. Yet, the Authority inexplicably reached the opposite result here, where the only difference is that the parties bargained somewhat earlier in time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Inconsistency With Private Sector Labor Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third flaw in the Authority's "waiver" approach is that it is inconsistent with the principles of private sector labor law upon which the Authority purported to rely, and which the Authority advances in this court in defense of the results reached in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>. Under private sector law, the parties to a collective bargaining agreement may negotiate about many matters that would otherwise constitute "statutory rights"; if agreement is reached, the parties' collective bargaining agreement supplants the statute as the source of rights and obligations regarding such matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 460 U.S. 693, 705-07, 103 S. Ct. 1467, 1475-76, 75 L. Ed.2d 387 (1983); <span class="Italic">Plumbers &#x0026; Pipefitters Local Union No. 520 v. NLRB</span>, 955 F.2d 744, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">American Freight Sys., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 722 F.2d 828, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority paid lip service to this principle by holding that parties may negotiate contractual provisions that "cover" the union's statutory right to bargain over impact and implementation matters, such that the negotiated agreement will take the place of the statutory right with respect to those matters. But the Authority's waiver-based approach for determining when a subject is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement makes that result virtually impossible to attain. As such, the Authority's approach runs counter to the very private sector principles that the Authority apparently intended to follow.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority argues that its "waiver" approach is consistent with <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Jacobs Mfg. Co.</span>, 196 F.2d 680 (2d Cir. 1952), and other private sector precedents. But <span class="Italic">Jacobs Mfg. Co</span>. and its progeny have never been read to require continuous bargaining with respect to matters addressed in a collective bargaining agreement. This court, other courts of appeals and the National Labor Relations Board ("Board") have rejected that notion time and time again. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Electrical Workers</span>, 927 F.2d at 640 ("The union may exercise its right to bargain about a particular subject by negotiating for a provision in the collective bargaining contract that fixes the parties' rights and forecloses further mandatory bargaining as to that subject.")....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, then, the Authority's approach in the cases at bar is not supported by the private sector precedent upon which the Authority purported to rely. The Authority's test for when a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement is significantly narrower than the standard that obtains in the private sector. Indeed, the Authority's test is so narrow that it effectively prevents the parties from ever fully incorporating any mandatory subject of bargaining into their collective-bargaining agreement, a result totally at odds with private sector principles. Because the Authority purported to rely on private sector law in formulating its "waiver" approach, its departure from those principles constitutes an independent ground upon which reversal is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Cases at Issue</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having considered, and rejected, the Authority's so-called "waiver" approach for determining when a matter is "covered by" a collective bargaining agreement, we now turn to an examination of the facts of the cases at bar. The Marine Corps argues that under any reasonable definition of "covered by," the impact and implementation of employee "details" and performance standards are "covered by" the MLA. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The MLA contains detailed provisions concerning the procedures that the Marine Corps must follow when it temporarily reassigns employees or modifies performance standards.&#x2003;Article 16 of the Agreement defines when employee "details" will be implemented, to what kinds of positions an employee may be detailed, how long a detail may last and what effect a detail will have on an employee's salary and liability for union dues....&#8197;Similarly, Article 31 of the MLA establishes comprehensive procedures that the agency must follow when it modifies performance criteria--including advance notice to employees, an opportunity for employee participation in the creation of performance standards and an overarching requirement that the standards implemented be "fair and reasonable." The obvious purpose of both Articles is to limit the Marine Corps' discretion in exercising its right to detail employees and set performance criteria, with a view towards mitigating the impact of those actions on affected employees. And since Articles 16 and 31 are subject to the MLA's grievance and arbitration procedures, any deviations by the agency from their terms can be checked by resort to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, neither Article 16 nor Article 31 "specifically address[es] the full range of impact and implementation issues" that might conceivably arise...but, as we have explained, such a standard is both unrealistic and impermissible. That the Authority embraced it merely demonstrates the depth of the confusion engendered by the Authority's flawed transformation of the two-part duty to bargain test adopted in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> into a one-part "clear and unmistakable waiver" inquiry.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that under any reasonable definition of the term "covered by," the impact and implementation matters related to employee details and performance criteria are covered by Articles 16 and 31 of the MLA. Moreover, given the FSLMRS's policy of promoting collective bargaining by preserving contractual repose, we believe that this conclusion follows inescapably from the purposes of the Statute itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority does not contest the Marine Corps' assertion that it fully complied with the requirements of Articles 16 and 31 of the MLA when it detailed the four Albany employees and implemented the new performance criteria at the Barstow facility. As such, the Marine Corps incurred no obligation to consult or bargain with the AFGE, because the "impact and implementation" issues relevant to those actions are "covered by" the MLA--that is, the agency and the union <span class="Italic">had already bargained</span> with respect to those matters. It follows that the Marine Corps did not violate the Statute on the facts presented in Albany and Barstow, and that the Authority erred by concluding otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Put another way, the MLA plainly authorized the Marine Corps to detail employees and establish performance criteria in the manner that it did. Consequently, the agency's actions did not effect a "change" in the employees' conditions of employment, and so no bargaining obligation arose. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(d)(2)(A) (providing that agency's duty to consult arises only as to "any substantive <span class="Italic">change</span> in conditions of employment proposed by the agency"); <span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base</span>, 9 F.L.R.A. at 777 (finding no duty to bargain where agency followed procedures specified in contract in taking "adverse action" against employees)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this result, we need not, and do not, attempt to establish a definitive test for determining when an otherwise bargainable matter is "covered by" a public sector collective bargaining agreement, such that there is no further duty on the part of the agency to engage in "impact and implementation" bargaining with respect to that matter. We do hold, however, that the FLRA's so-called "waiver" approach cannot withstand scrutiny in a case of this sort; we also hold that whatever the precise parameters of the "covered by" standard may be, the matters at issue in <span class="Italic">Albany</span> and <span class="Italic">Barstow</span> fall well within the ambit of that term.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the confusion engendered by the Authority's impermissible "waiver" approach is removed, it becomes clear that this is an easy case. The FSLMRS gave the Marine Corps the right to "detail" employees and set performance criteria, subject to the obligation that the agency bargain with the union over the impact and implementation of its exercise of those rights. Here, the Marine Corps fulfilled its obligation by bargaining with the AFGE during the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the MLA. The results of that bargaining are Articles 16 and 31 of the Agreement, which set forth specific, agreed-upon procedures that the Marine Corps must follow when it implements employee details and revises performance standards. As the Authority concedes, the Marine Corps followed these bargained-for procedures in the two cases at bar. The Statute requires no more.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, the complaints were dismissed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE</span>, 45 FLRA 502 (1992), and <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 45 FLRA 533 (1992). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-058.html#sec8-59">Settlement That Violates Statute</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-16-052.html#sec8-53">Clear and Patent Breaches of Negotiated Agreements</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Matters advanced. The division among the circuit courts led to review of the midterm bargaining issue in the Supreme Court. Early in 1999 the Supreme Court decided <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1309 v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1003 (1999), requiring elaboration from FLRA of the circumstances supporting midterm bargaining. The Court determined, in the majority Opinion, returning the case to FLRA for further consideration of midterm bargaining obligations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute requires federal agencies and the unions that represent their employees to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). We here consider whether that duty to bargain extends to a clause proposed by a union that would bind the parties to bargain midterm--that is, while the basic comprehensive labor contract is in effect--about subjects not included in that basic contract. We reverse a lower court holding that the statutory duty to bargain does not encompass midterm bargaining (or bargaining about midterm bargaining). We conclude that the Statute delegates to the Federal Labor Relations Authority the legal power to determine whether the parties must engage in midterm bargaining (or bargaining about that matter). We remand these cases so that the Authority may exercise that power.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1233"></span>Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute or FSLMRS) in 1978<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>. Declaring that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest," &#x00A7; 7101(a), the Statute grants federal agency employees the right to organize, provides for collective bargaining, and defines various unfair labor practices<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(a)(1), 7116. It creates the Federal Labor Relations Authority, which it makes responsible for implementing the Statute through the exercise of broad adjudicatory, policymaking, and rulemaking powers. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7104, 7105. And it establishes within the Authority a Federal Service Impasses Panel, to which it grants the power to resolve negotiation impasses through compulsory arbitration, &#x00A7; 7119, hence without the strikes that the law forbids to federal employees, &#x00A7; 7116(b)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of particular relevance here, the Statute requires a federal agency employer to "meet" with the employees' collective-bargaining representative and to "negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). The Courts of Appeals disagree about whether, or the extent to which, this good-faith-bargaining requirement extends to midterm bargaining. Suppose, for example, that the federal agency and the union negotiate a basic 5-year contract. In the third year a matter arises that the contract does not address. If the union seeks negotiations about the matter, does the Statute require the agency to bargain then and there, or can the agency wait for basic contract renewal negotiations? Does it matter whether the basic contract itself contains a "zipper clause" expressly forbidding such bargaining? Does it matter whether the basic contract itself contains a clause expressly permitting midterm bargaining? Can the parties insist upon bargaining endterm (that is, during the negotiations over adopting or renewing a basic labor contract) about whether to include one or the other such clauses in the basic contract itself? In 1985 the Authority began to answer some of these questions. It considered a union's effort to force midterm negotiations about a matter the basic labor contract did not address, and it held that the Statute <span class="Italic">did not</span> require the agency to bargain. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 17 FLRA 731 (1985) (<span class="Italic">IRS I</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, however, set aside the Authority's ruling. The court held that in light of the intent and purpose of the Statute, it must be read to require midterm bargaining, inasmuch as it did not create any distinction between bargaining at the end of a labor contract's term and bargaining during that term. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295 (1987) <span class="Italic">(NTEU)</span>. On remand the Authority reversed its earlier position. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 29 FLRA 162, 166 (1987) (<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>). Accepting the D.C. Circuit's analysis, the Authority held:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[T]he duty to bargain in good faith imposed by the Statute requires an agency to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union-initiated proposals concerning matters which are not addressed in the [basic] agreement and were not clearly and unmistakably waived by the union during negotiation of the agreement<span class="Italic">." Id</span>., at 167.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Fourth Circuit has taken a different view of the matter. It has held that "union-initiated midterm bargaining is not required by the statute and would undermine the congressional policies underlying the statute." <span class="Italic">Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1280, 1281 (1992) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Nor, in its view, may the basic labor contract itself impose a midterm bargaining duty upon the parties. <span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 106 F. 3d 1158, 1163 (1997) (holding unlawful a midterm bargaining clause that the Federal Service Impasses Panel had imposed upon the parties' basic labor contract).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present suit, the National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1309 (Union), representing employees of the United States Geological Survey, a subagency of the Department of the Interior (Agency), proposed including in the basic labor contract a midterm bargaining provision that said,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"The Union may request and the Employer will be obliged to negotiate [midterm] on any negotiable matters not covered by the provisions of this [basic] agreement." <span class="Italic">Department of Interior</span>, 52 FLRA 475, 476 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, relying on the Fourth Circuit's view that the Statute prohibits such a provision, refused to accept, or to bargain about, the proposed clause. The Authority, reiterating its own (and the D.C. Circuit's) contrary view, held that the Agency's refusal to bargain amounted to an unfair labor practice<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., at 479-481. The Statute itself, said the Authority, imposes an obligation to engage in midterm bargaining--an obligation that the proposed clause only reiterates<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., at 479-480. And even if such an obligation did not exist under the Statute, the Authority added, a proposal to create a <span class="Italic">contractual</span> obligation to bargain midterm is a fit subject for endterm negotiation<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., at 480-481. Consequently, the Authority ordered the Agency to bargain over the proposed clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fourth Circuit set aside the Authority's order. 132 F.3d 157 (1997). The court reiterated its own view that the Statute itself does not impose any midterm bargaining duty<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., at 161-162. That being so, it concluded, the parties should not be required to bargain endterm about including a clause that would require bargaining midterm. The court reasoned that once bargaining over such a clause began, the employer would have no choice but to accept the clause. Were the employer not to do so (by bargaining to impasse over the proposed clause), the Federal Service Impasses Panel would then inevitably insert the clause over the employer's objection, as the Impasses Panel (like the D.C. Circuit) believes that a midterm bargaining clause would merely reiterate the duty to bargain midterm that the Statute itself imposes. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> to consider the conflicting views of the Circuits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We shall focus primarily upon the basic question that divided the Circuits: Does the Statute itself impose a duty to bargain during the term of an existing labor contract? The Fourth Circuit thought that the Statute did not impose a duty to bargain midterm and that the matter was sufficiently clear to warrant judicial rejection of the contrary view of the agency charged with the Statute's administration<span class="Italic">. SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1284 (stating that "'Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,'" and quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc.</span> <span class="Italic">v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984)). We do not agree with the Fourth Circuit, for we find the Statute's language sufficiently ambiguous or open on the point as to require judicial deference to reasonable interpretation or elaboration by the agency charged with its execution<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 842-845; <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 644-645 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit, the Fourth Circuit, and the Authority all agree that the Statute itself does not expressly address union-initiated midterm bargaining<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 810 F.2d, at 298; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1284. The Statute's relevant language simply says that federal agency employer and union representative "shall meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). It defines the key term "collective bargaining agreement" as an "agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining." &#x00A7; 7103(a)(8). And it goes on to define "collective bargaining" as involving the meeting of employer and employee representatives "at reasonable times" to "consult" and to "bargain in a good-faith effort to reach agreement with respect to the conditions of employment," incorporating "any collective bargaining agreement reached" as a result of these negotiations in "a written document." &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12). This language, taken literally, may or may not include a duty to bargain collectively midterm.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency, here represented by the Solicitor General, argues that in context, this language <span class="Italic">must</span> exclude midterm bargaining. We shall explain why we do not agree with each of the Agency's basic arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency makes a variety of linguistic arguments. As an initial matter, it emphasizes the words "arriving at" in the Statute's general statement that the parties must bargain "for the purposes of <span class="Italic">arriving at</span> a collective bargaining agreement." This statement tends to exclude midterm bargaining, the Agency contends, because parties engage in midterm bargaining, not for the purpose of <span class="Italic">arriving at</span>, but for the purpose of <span class="Italic">supplementing</span>, their basic, comprehensive labor contract. In other words, the basic collective-bargaining agreement is the only appropriate destination at which negotiations might "arriv[e]." The Agency adds that "collective bargaining agreement" is a term of art, which only and always refers to basic labor contracts, not to midterm agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, while the Agency acknowledges that there is a duty to bargain midterm in the private sector, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB</span> <span class="Italic">v. Jacobs Manufacturing Co.</span>, 196 F.2d 680 (CA2 1952), it argues that this private-sector duty is based upon language in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) that is different in significant respects from the language in the Statute here. The Agency explains that the NLRA defines private-sector collective bargaining to include (1) negotiation "with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, <span class="Italic">or</span> [(2)] the negotiation of an agreement, or any question arising thereunder." 29 USC &#x00A7; 158(d) (emphasis added). The "or," under this view, indicates that private-sector employers have a comprehensive duty to "bargain collectively" whether or not such bargaining is part of "the negotiation of an agreement" leading to "written contract."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, these linguistic arguments, while logical, make too much of too little. One can easily read "arriving at <span class="Italic">a collective bargaining agreement</span>" as including an agreement reached at the conclusion of midterm bargaining, particularly because the Statute itself does no more than define the relevant term "collective bargaining agreement" in a circular way--as "an agreement entered into as a result of collective bargaining." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7103(a)(8). Nor have we found any statute, judicial opinion, agency document, or treatise that says whether the words "collective bargaining agreement" are words of art that must necessarily exclude midterm agreements. Finally, the linguistic differences between the NLRA and the FSLMRS tell us little, particularly given the fact that the two labor statutes, like collective bargaining itself, are not otherwise identical in the two sectors. For all these reasons, we find in the relevant statutory language ambiguity, not certainty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency--like the Fourth Circuit--contends that the <span id="Page_1234"></span>Statute's policies demand a reading of the statutory language that would exclude midterm bargaining from its definition of "collective bargaining." The availability of midterm bargaining, the Agency argues, might lead unions to withhold certain subjects from ordinary endterm negotiations and then to raise them during the term, under more favorable bargaining conditions. A union might conclude, for example, that it is more likely to get what it wants by presenting a proposal during the term (when no other issues are on the table and a compromise is less likely) and then negotiating to impasse, thus leaving the matter for the Federal Service Impasses Panel to resolve. The Agency also points out that public-sector and private-sector bargaining differ in this respect. Private-sector unions enforce their views through strikes, and because they hesitate to strike midterm, they also have no particular incentive to bargain midterm. But public-sector unions enforce their views through compulsory arbitration, not strikes. Hence, the argument goes, public-sector unions have a unique incentive to bargain midterm on a piecemeal basis, thereby threatening to undermine the basic collective-bargaining process. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 956 F.2d, at 1288-1289.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other policy concerns, however, argue for a different reading of the Statute. Without midterm bargaining, for example, will it prove possible to find a collective solution to a workplace problem, say a health or safety hazard, that first appeared midterm? The Statute's emphasis upon collective bargaining as "contribut[ing] to the effective conduct of public business," 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(B), suggests that it would favor joint, not unilateral, solutions to such midterm problems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority would seem better suited than a court to make the workplace-related empirical judgments that would help properly balance these, and other, policy-related considerations. The Statute does not indicate that Congress itself decided to make these specific policy judgments. Hence the Agency's policy arguments illustrate the need for the Authority's elaboration or refinement of the basic statutory collective-bargaining obligation; they illustrate the appropriateness of judicial deference to considered Authority views on the matter; and, most importantly, they do not narrow the scope of a statutory provision the language of which is consistent with a variety of interpretations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Agency argues that the Statute's history and prior administrative practice support its view that federal agencies have no duty to bargain midterm. The Statute grew out of an Executive Order that previously had governed federal-sector labor relations<span class="Italic">. See</span> Exec. Order No. 11491, 3 CFR 861 (1966-1970 Comp.), as amended by Exec. Order Nos. 11616, 11636, and 11838, 3 CFR 605, 634, 957 (1971-1975 Comp.). In support, the Agency cites a case in which an Assistant Secretary of Labor, applying that Executive Order, dismissed an unfair labor practice complaint on the ground, among others, that a federal agency need not bargain over midterm union proposals<span class="Italic">. Army and Air Force Exchange Serv., Capital Exchange Region Headquarters</span>, Case No. 22-6657(CA), 2 Rulings on Requests for Review of Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations 561-562 (1976) (not reviewed by the Federal Labor Relations Council, predecessor to the Authority); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">IRS I</span>, 17 FLRA, at 736-737, n.7 (finding, based upon this decision, that there was no obligation to bargain over midterm union proposals under the Executive Order). A single alternative ground, however--in a single, unreviewed decision from before the Statute was enacted--does not demonstrate the kind of historical practice that one might assume would be reflected in the Statute, particularly when at least one treatise suggested at the time that federal labor relations practice was to the contrary<span class="Italic">. See</span> H. Robinson, Negotiability in the Federal Sector 10-11, and n.9 (1981) (stating that under the Executive Order both unions and agencies had a continuing duty to bargain through the term of a basic labor contract).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also points to a Senate Report in support of its interpretation of the Statute.&#x2003;That Report speaks of the parties' "mutual duty to bargain" with respect to (1) "changes in established personnel policies proposed by management," and (2) "negotiable proposals initiated by either the agency or [the union]...in the context of negotiations <span class="Italic">leading to a basic collective bargaining agreement.</span>" S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 104 (1978) (emphasis added). This Report, however, concerns a bill that contains language similar to the language before us but was not enacted into law. According to the D.C. Circuit, at least, any distinction between basic and midterm bargaining that is indicated by this passage "did not survive the rejection by Congress of the Senate's restrictive view of the rights of labor and the importance of collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 810 F.2d, at 298. In any event, the Report's list of possible occasions for collective bargaining does not purport to be an exclusive list; it does not say that the Statute was understood to exclude midterm bargaining; and any such implication is simply too distant to control our reading of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, the Agency and the Fourth Circuit contend that the "management rights" provision of the Statute, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7106, <span class="Italic">does</span> authorize limited midterm bargaining in respect to certain matters (not here at issue), and that by negative implication it denies permission to bargain midterm in respect to any others<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1284 ("The inclusion of a specific duty of midterm effects bargaining...suggests the inadvisability of reading a more general duty into the statute"). Our examination of that provision, however, finds little support for such a strong negative implication.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection (a) of the management rights provision withdraws from collective bargaining certain subjects that it reserves exclusively for decision by management. It specifies, for example, that federal agency "management official[s]" will retain their authority to hire, fire, promote, and assign work, and also to determine the agency's "mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices." &#x00A7; 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection (b), however, permits a certain amount of collective bargaining in respect to the very subjects that subsection (a) withdrew. Subsection (b) states:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"<span class="Italic">Nothing in this section shall preclude</span> any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(1) at the election of the agency, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(2) procedures which management officials...will observe in exercising any authority under this section; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(3) appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials." &#x00A7; 7106(b) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two subsections of the management rights provision, taken together, do not help the Agency. While the provision contemplates that bargaining over the impact and implementation of management changes may take place during the term of the basic labor contract, subsection (b) need not be read to actually impose a duty to bargain midterm. The italicized clause, "[n]othing in this section shall preclude," indicates only that the delegation of certain rights to management (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, promotions) shall not <span class="Italic">preclude</span> negotiations about certain related matters (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, promotion procedures). By its terms, then, subsection (b) does nothing more than create an exception to subsection (a), preserving the duty to bargain with respect to certain matters otherwise committed to the discretion of management. Because &#x00A7; 7106(b) chiefly addresses the subject matter of bargaining and not the timing, one could reasonably conclude that while that subsection contemplates midterm bargaining in the circumstances there specified, the duty to bargain midterm finds its source elsewhere in the Statute. Hence, the management rights provision seems to hurt, as much as to help, the Agency's basic argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The upshot of this analysis is that where the Agency and the Fourth Circuit find a clear statutory denial of any midterm bargaining obligation, we find ambiguity created by the Statute's use of general language that might, or might not, encompass various forms of midterm bargaining. That kind of statutory ambiguity is inconsistent both with the Fourth Circuit's absolute reading of the Statute and also with the D.C. Circuit's similarly absolute, but opposite, reading. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 956 F.2d, at 1284, with <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 810 F.2d, at 301 (rejecting the Authority's position that there is no duty to bargain midterm on the ground that it is "contrary to the intent of the legislature and the guiding purpose of the statute"). Indeed, the D.C. Circuit's analysis implicitly concedes the need to make at least <span class="Italic">some</span> midterm bargaining distinctions, when it assumes that the midterm bargaining obligation does not extend to matters that are covered by the basic contract<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 296.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory ambiguity is perfectly consistent, however, with the conclusion that Congress delegated to the Authority the power to determine--within appropriate legal bounds, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, 5 USC &#x00A7; 706 (Administrative Procedure Act); <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </span>467 U. S. 837 (1984)--whether, when, where, and what sort of midterm bargaining is required. The Statute's delegation of rulemaking, adjudicatory, and policymaking powers to the Authority supports this conclusion<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7105(a)(1) ("Authority shall provide leadership in establishing policies and guidance"); &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E) (Authority "resolves issues relating to the duty to bargain in good faith"); &#x00A7; 7117(c) (Authority resolves disputes about whether the duty to bargain in good faith extends to a particular matter); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Govt. Employees, Local 2986, AFL-CIO</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 1022, 1027 (CA9 1985); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Govt. Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Soc. Sec. Dist. Office Locals, San Francisco Region v. FLRA</span>, 716 F.2d 47, 50 (CADC 1983). This conclusion is also supported by precedent recognizing the similarity of the Authority's public-sector and the National Labor Relations Board's private-sector roles. As we have recognized, the Authority's function is "to develop specialized expertise in its field of labor relations and to use that expertise to give content to the principles and goals set forth in the Act," and it "is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its 'special function of applying the general provisions of the Act to the complexities' of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span> <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97 (1983) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB </span>v. <span class="Italic">Erie Resistor Corp.</span>, 373 U.S. 221, 236 (1963)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1235"></span>We conclude that Congress "left" the matters of whether, when, and where midterm bargaining is required "to be resolved by the agency charged with the administration of the statute in light of everyday realities." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 865-866.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The specific question before us is whether an agency must bargain endterm about including in the basic labor contract a clause that would require certain forms of midterm bargaining.&#x2003;As is true of midterm bargaining itself, and for similar reasons, the Statute grants the Authority leeway (within ordinary legal limits) in answering that question as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority says that it has determined, as a matter of its own judgment, that the parties must bargain over such a provision. Our reading of its relevant administrative determinations, however, leads us to conclude that its judgment on the matter was occasioned by the D.C. Circuit's holding that the Statute must be read to impose on agencies a duty to bargain midterm. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Bd. Professional Assn.</span>, 30 FLRA 852, 859-860 (1988) (midterm bargaining clause is negotiable because it "reiterates a right the Union has under the Statute"); 52 FLRA, at 479 (in the instant suit, restating that same conclusion). The Authority did indicate below that even if it agreed with the Fourth Circuit's position that the Statute does not impose a duty to bargain midterm, the outcome in this litigation would be no different, as the Authority "'has previously upheld the negotiability of proposals despite the absence of a statutory right concerning the matter in question.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 480 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span>, 51 FLRA 124, 127 (1995), <span class="Italic">enf. denied</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Energy v. FLRA</span>, 106 F.3d 1158 (CA4 1997)). This explanation, however, seems more an effort to respond to, and to distinguish, a contrary judicial authority, rather than an independently reasoned effort to develop complex labor policies. Regardless, the Authority's conclusion would seem linked to the D.C. Circuit's basic understanding about the statutory requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of our determination that the Statute does not resolve the question of midterm bargaining, nor the related question of bargaining about midterm bargaining, we believe the Authority should have the opportunity to consider these questions aware that the Statute permits, but does not compel, the conclusions it reached.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision of the Fourth Circuit is vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">In accordance with the directive of the Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit remanded the <span class="Italic">Interior</span> case to FLRA for further consideration. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 174 F.3d 393, 394 (4th Cir. 1999). On remand, after seeking briefs from <span class="Italic">amici</span>, FLRA reconfirmed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior and NFFE Local 1309</span>, 56 FLRA 45, 50-54 (2000), the obligation of agencies to bargain midterm over matters not contained or covered by the principal labor contract. FLRA reaffirmed that midterm bargaining would be precluded if the matter were covered by an existing contract or, should that not be the case, if the agency could demonstrate a waiver of bargaining by showing that a matter was fully discussed and consciously explored during negotiations and that the union consciously yielded or otherwise clearly and unmistakably waived its interest in the matter. If either party desired to preclude midterm bargaining over a negotiable matter, the preclusion option was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the Supreme Court's remand instructions, we have considered anew the question of union-initiated midterm bargaining. We conclude that an agency is required to bargain over a proposal obligating the agency to engage in midterm bargaining over matters not contained in or covered by the term agreement. Such proposals are within the duty to bargain for two reasons: First they further the purposes of the Statute and thus restate a statutory obligation; and second, they are not inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation. Applying this determination, we find that Survey committed the unfair labor practices as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">II.&#x2003;Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Facts</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts are described in the Authority's original decision. 52 FLRA at 476-77. As relevant on remand, the Union offered the following proposal during negotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Article 7. Section 2.b. Union-initiated Bargaining. The Union may request and the Employer will be obliged to negotiate on any negotiable matters not covered by the provisions of this agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Survey refused to negotiate over the proposal, claiming it was outside its obligation to bargain. The Union then filed the unfair labor practice charge which resulted in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Relevant Administrative and Judicial Precedent</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is a substantial background of administrative and judicial precedent concerning an agency's obligation to bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals. A brief history of that precedent follows.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Authority's Decisions in <span class="Italic">IRS I and IRS II</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority first considered an agency's obligation to bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 17 FLRA 731 (1985) (<span class="Italic">IRS I</span>). There the Authority determined that Congress intended to limit the obligation to bargain over union-initiated proposals to situations where the parties were negotiating a basic or term collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 735-36.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">IRS I</span> was reversed and remanded by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>). Relying on private sector precedent and congressional intent to encourage and promote collective bargaining in the federal sector, the court held that the obligation to bargain under the Statute extends to union-initiated midterm proposals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 301.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand from the D.C. Circuit, the Authority adopted the court's reasoning and held that an agency is obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters not "contained in or covered by" the term agreement unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service</span>, 29 FLRA 162, 166 (1987) (<span class="Italic">IRS II</span>). In response to the Authority's petition for enforcement of <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, the Internal Revenue Service suggested that the entire D.C. Circuit initially consider the case. This suggestion was denied. <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 838 F.2d 567 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">FLRA v. IRS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Fourth Circuit's Decision in <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1280 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit expressly disagreed with the reasoning of both the Authority and the D.C. Circuit and concluded that "union-initiated midterm bargaining is not required by the [S]tatute and would undermine the congressional policies underlying the [S]tatute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281. In subsequent cases the Authority respectfully declined to follow the Fourth Circuit's decision, adhering to the holding in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 45 FLRA 1090, 1091 n.2 (1992), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 991 F.2d 790 (4th Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 46 FLRA 1184, 1186 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 124 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span>), the Authority was presented with the issue of midterm bargaining in a new context. In resolving a bargaining impasse, the Federal Service Impasses Panel (Panel) had imposed a provision in a contract providing that during the term of the agreement, the employer would be obligated to bargain over union-initiated proposals not contained in or covered by the agreement unless the union had waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 125. On review of the contract, the Department of Energy disapproved the provision as being contrary to law, citing <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On alternative grounds, the Authority rejected the Department of Energy's assertion that, under the authority of <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>, the disputed provision was contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 127-28. First, the Authority concluded that the disputed contract provision was negotiable because it was not inconsistent with any provision of applicable law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 129. Second, the Authority noted that it had respectfully declined to follow the Fourth Circuit's <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span> decision, instead adhering to its precedent that agencies are required under the Statute to engage in midterm bargaining over union-initiated proposals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 127 n.4. Accordingly, the Authority found that although the negotiability of the provision did not depend on finding a statutory obligation to bargain midterm, the proposal did restate the statutory obligation and was negotiable on that ground as well. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 128 n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Fourth Circuit granted the Department of Energy's petition for review and reversed the Authority's decision. <span class="Italic">Department of Energy v. FLRA</span>, 106 F.3d 1158 (4th Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Energy v. FLRA</span>). Although recognizing that the question of whether the Statute imposes a duty differs from the question of whether an agency must bargain regarding a clause in a collective bargaining agreement, the court found that midterm bargaining is inconsistent with the Statute because it is "at odds with the policies underlying [the Statute] and is wholly contrary to congressional intent." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1164.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Authority's Original Decision in This Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While <span class="Italic">Energy v. FLRA</span> was pending before the Fourth Circuit, but before the case was decided, the Authority issued its original decision and order in the instant case (52 FLRA 475). As relevant here, the Authority concluded that Survey violated the Statute by refusing to bargain over a proposal substantially identical to one the Authority had determined was within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority noted in this regard that the proposal at issue was negotiable both because it "reiterated a right the Union had under the Statute" (<span class="Italic">id.</span> at 479) and because the proposal was otherwise within the obligation to bargain--specifically rejecting Survey's assertion that <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span> dictated a contrary result. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority expressly relied on the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 480-81. Accordingly, the Authority found that the refusal to bargain was an unfair labor practice and ordered Survey to bargain over the proposal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 482.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1236"></span>D.&#x2003;The Fourth Circuit's Decision in <span class="Italic">Interior v. FLRA I</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Survey petitioned the Fourth Circuit for review.&#x2003;Finding the case controlled by <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Energy v. FLRA</span>, the court granted the petition for review and denied the Authority's cross-application for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Interior v. FLRA I</span>, 132 F.3d at 162. The court found no meaningful distinction between the legality of a midterm bargaining requirement imposed by the Panel as in <span class="Italic">Energy v. FLRA</span>, and an agency's obligation to negotiate over a proposal to bargain midterm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 161. Accordingly, the court found Survey was not obligated to bargain over the Union's proposal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 162.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;The Supreme Court's Decision in <span class="Italic">NFFE and FLRA v. Interior</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Acknowledging the split in the United States Courts of Appeals on this issue, the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>. The Court focused on the issue of whether the Statute "impose[s] a duty to bargain during the term of an existing labor contract." <span class="Italic">NFFE and</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Interior</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1007. Rejecting the view of the Fourth Circuit, the Court majority found "the Statute's language sufficiently ambiguous or open on the point as to require judicial deference to reasonable interpretation or elaboration by the [Authority]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this determination, the Court, after pointing out that the Statute did not expressly address union-initiated midterm bargaining, rejected Survey's arguments that the Statute prohibited midterm bargaining. Specifically, the Court disagreed with Survey's assertions that midterm bargaining was inconsistent with the language, legislative history, policies, prior practice, or management rights provision (section 7106(a)) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1008-1010. Instead, the Court found the statutory ambiguity "inconsistent both with the Fourth Circuit's absolute reading of the Statute and also with the D.C. Circuit's similarly absolute, but opposite, reading." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1010. The Court found this "statutory ambiguity [to be] perfectly consistent, however, with the conclusion that Congress delegated to the Authority the power to determine...whether, when, where, and what sort of midterm bargaining is required<span class="Italic">." Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, noting that the specific question before the Court concerned "whether an agency must bargain endterm about including in the basic labor contract a clause that would require certain forms of midterm bargaining," the Court concluded that "the Statute grants the Authority leeway (within ordinary legal limits) in answering that question as well<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 1011. In this respect, the Court found that the Authority's prior explanation concerning the duty to bargain over such proposals was "more an effort to respond to, and to distinguish, a contrary judicial authority, rather than an independently reasoned effort to develop complex labor policies." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Court remanded to afford the Authority the opportunity to consider the issues of midterm bargaining and the related question of bargaining about midterm bargaining, "aware that the Statute permits, but does not compel, the conclusions [that the Authority] reached." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court vacated and remanded the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Interior v. FLRA I</span>. In turn, the Fourth Circuit remanded the case to the Authority "for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the Supreme Court<span class="Italic">." Interior v. FLRA II</span>, 174 F.3d at 394.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Union's Proposal Is Substantially Identical to One That the Authority Previously Found Negotiable</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found in its original decision that the Union's proposal was substantially identical to that found negotiable in <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board Professional Association and Merit Systems Protection Board, Washington, D.C.</span>, 30 FLRA 852 (1988). <span class="Italic">Interior</span>, 52 FLRA at 479. That finding is uncontested and reaffirmed here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Proposals Requiring Union-Initiated Midterm Bargaining Are Within the Duty to Bargain under the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The litigation of this case has focused on the question of whether proposals requiring midterm bargaining in certain situations are within an agency's obligation to bargain. The Supreme Court concluded that Congress has delegated to the Authority the power to determine the extent to which midterm bargaining (or bargaining over midterm bargaining, as specifically at issue here) is required under the Statute. <span class="Italic">NFFE and FLRA v. Interior</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1007. For the reasons explained below, we find that the Union's proposal is negotiable for two reasons. First, we conclude that under the Statute, agencies are obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters that are not "contained in or covered by" the term agreement, unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved; thus, the Union's proposal is within the duty to bargain because it restates a statutory obligation. Second, the proposal is not otherwise inconsistent with federal law or government-wide regulation, and is therefore within the Survey's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Agencies Are Required to Bargain over Union-Initiated Midterm Proposals</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;Requiring Agencies to Bargain over Union-Initiated Midterm Proposals Is Consistent with Congress's Commitment to Collective Bargaining in the Federal Sector</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has unambiguously concluded that collective bargaining in the public sector "safeguards the public interest," "contributes to the effective conduct of public business," and "facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1). Nothing in the plain wording of the Statute supports the inference that these conclusions are not as applicable to midterm bargaining as they are to term bargaining. In that regard, the Supreme Court has noted that "[c]ollective bargaining is a continuing process" involving, among other things, "resolution of new problems not covered by existing agreements." <span class="Italic">Conley v. Gibson</span>, 355 U.S. 41, 46 (1957).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As argued by the General Counsel, the Charging Party and a number of amici, matters appropriate for resolution through collective bargaining are sometimes unforeseen and unforeseeable at the time of term negotiations. These matters include not only problems that might arise because of a change in workplace environment, but also new areas of agency discretion occasioned by changes in law or regulations. For example, when agencies were authorized to provide a portion of premiums for employee liability insurance, the National Treasury Employees Union was able to raise the issue midterm rather than have to wait for either management to initiate action or for the next round of term negotiations. Such bargaining furthers the Statute's goal of enabling employees, "through labor organizations of their own choosing" to more timely participate in "decisions which affect them" and in cooperatively resolving disputes. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1). Moreover, the negotiation of such workplace issues is preferable to addressing them through the more adversarial grievance/arbitration process, as suggested by one <span class="Italic">amicus</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Supreme Court has recognized that "[i]n passing the Civil Service Reform Act, Congress unquestionably intended to strengthen the position of federal unions and make the collective-bargaining process a more effective instrument of the public interest...." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA,</span> 464 U.S. 89, 107 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 750 F.2d at 148 ("equalizing the positions of labor and management at the bargaining table" is a primary goal of the Statute). Consistent with those goals, Congress has defined the obligation to bargain as "mutual." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12). It is undisputed that the parties must bargain over an agency employer's proposed changes in conditions of employment midterm, whether the proposed change involves the exercise of the management rights set forth in section 7106(a) of the Statute, or matters that are fully negotiable.[11] Requiring an agency, during the term of an agreement, to bargain over a union's proposed changes in negotiable conditions of employment thus maintains the mutuality of the bargaining obligation prescribed in the Statute. Because this requirement serves to equalize the positions of the parties, we disagree with our dissenting colleague's determination that "a counterbalance...is appropriate" to the union's right to engage in midterm bargaining.[12] With respect to negotiable conditions of employment, the rights and obligations of the unions and the agencies already are equivalent. And as the D.C. Circuit has recognized, collective bargaining, including midterm bargaining, is in the public interest because it "contributes to stability in federal labor-management relations and effective government." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d at 300.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;With respect to the latter, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California, </span>46 FLRA 782, 783 (1992) (agency obligated to bargain over changes in prices of soft drinks in vending machines).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Neither Survey nor the dissent recognize that, under the Statute, there is a mutual obligation to bargain. Survey argues that agencies may bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals but should not be required to do so. Under Survey's approach, unions would have an obligation to bargain over agency-initiated proposals, but agencies would have the discretion to bargain or not over union-initiated proposals. The dissent theorizes that agencies--and only agencies--have the right to make changes midterm on fully negotiable matters that do not implicate management's 7106(a) rights. The dissent's remedy for this obvious imbalance is to permit unions to bargain to limit the agency's "right" to make such changes midterm. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This theory not only lacks a basis in the Statute, but also represents an asymmetrical view of the parties' collective bargaining rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, permitting unions to raise issues at the time they arise or become a priority for the parties serves the public interest in a more efficient Government because it will likely lead to more focused negotiations. As noted above, the ability to bargain over such issues in a timely manner is preferable to the alternative of leaving potentially important concerns unaddressed for perhaps a period of years until term negotiations on the basic contract commence again. Moreover, requiring unions to raise matters that do not currently present problems, but might do so in the future, could unnecessarily and inefficiently broaden and <span id="Page_1237"></span>prolong term negotiations. That is, by permitting unions to raise certain matters midterm, the term negotiations will, in our view, proceed more efficiently in addressing existing and primary problems, and there will be no requirement to bargain over remote and secondary issues that do not appear to raise immediate concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all these reasons, we find that requiring agencies to bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals furthers Congress's goal of promoting and strengthening collective bargaining in the federal workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;Union-Initiated Midterm Bargaining Will Not Cause Inefficiency in Government</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Mindful of Congress's admonition in section 7101(b) that the Statute should be interpreted in a manner consistent with an effective and efficient government, it is appropriate that we consider whether the benefits for collective bargaining found above are outweighed by potential costs and disruptions to government operations.[13] In that regard, amici, relying on and replicating arguments addressed with approval by the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>, assert that: unions will attempt to gain a tactical advantage by withholding proposals during term contract negotiations and then later pressing matters piecemeal during the term of the basic contract; there will be a significant number of midterm negotiations involving less important issues that will ultimately have to be resolved by the Panel; and this dispersal of the collective bargaining process will destabilize labor relations and increase costs as a result of rolling or continuous bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Our dissenting colleague concludes that union-initiated midterm bargaining is at odds with "the statutory standard under 7101(b)." We disagree with both this conclusion and the invocation of 7101(b) as an absolute standard in this or any other case. With regard to the latter point, the Authority is required to interpret the Statute "in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101(b). In so doing, however, the Authority must also bear in mind and balance other salient protections in the Statute, such as in this instance, the right to bargain collectively set out in section 7101(a). Further, even if we were to assume that midterm bargaining would have an adverse effect on government efficiency, the courts have recognized that the Authority must balance any tensions that may exist between the multiple statutory goals. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 826 F.2d 114, 121 (D.C. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, SSA Council 220, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 840 F.2d 925, 929 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that the evidence in the record before us supports the conclusion that requiring agencies to bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals will not result in significant costs or disruptions that would outweigh the benefits of such bargaining. This evidence includes the lack of litigation over midterm bargaining issues, the actual experience of the parties, and the legal constraints on the scope of midterm bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to litigation, review of Authority decisions reveals that only a few agencies have resisted the Authority's established position on the obligation to bargain midterm. Specifically, since 1987, when the Authority issued its decision in <span class="Italic">IRS II</span> establishing that agencies are obligated to bargain over union-initiated midterm proposals, the Authority has been presented with only three cases, outside of the geographical confines of the Fourth Circuit, where agencies have been found to have violated the Statute by refusing to engage in midterm bargaining.[14] These three cases comprise substantially less than one percent of the unfair labor practice cases resolved by the Authority during the same period. Further, during this same 12-year period, there have been only seven reported instances (approximately one percent of the Panel's reported decisions during that period) where the Panel has been obliged to resolve union-initiated midterm disputes.[15] In addition, according to the General Counsel, midterm bargaining is a dispositive issue in less than one percent of unfair labor practice charges filed. We agree with the General Counsel's assertion that the lack of litigation suggests that union-initiated midterm bargaining is either infrequent or that it is not a significant area of concern for the parties.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;The dissent questions the significance of the limited empirical data. Though the numbers are small, the very paucity of litigation over this issue directly rebuts the claims of the agency amici that union-initiated midterm bargaining will have significant effects on governmental operations. Moreover, as noted below, none of the empirical data reveals agency disruption or inefficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although the reported experience with union-initiated midterm bargaining is limited, it supports the conclusion that such bargaining has not and will not lead to continuous bargaining. According to NTEU's Director of Negotiations, in a nationwide bargaining unit of approximately 98,000 employees, the union has initiated midterm bargaining on 12 occasions in the past 10 years.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the record is devoid of probative evidence of excessive costs or disruption to agency operations as a result of union-initiated midterm bargaining. To establish the significant costs of bargaining on official time, <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> Social Security Administration submitted the Office of Personnel Management's Report on the use of official time for the first six months of 1998. However, that report sheds no light on the costs associated with midterm bargaining because the report only shows the amount of official time involved in "negotiations." There is no way of extracting from that data any information on the use of official time for midterm bargaining, let alone union-initiated midterm bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, constraints on union-initiated midterm bargaining make it unlikely that it will lead to continuous issue-by-issue bargaining. First, an agency is not required to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on matters that are "contained in or covered by" an agreement. <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, 29 FLRA at 166. The framework to determine whether a matter is "contained in or covered by" an agreement is established in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018 (examining "whether the matter is expressly contained in" or "'inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract'" (citations omitted)). And, as the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>, the "contained in or covered by test" balances the need for stability and the flexibility to address new matters. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1016-18. Some amici, agreeing with the Fourth Circuit's analysis, have suggested that unions will evade the "contained in or covered-by" limitation by withholding matters from term negotiations. These suggestions rely on the incorrect premise that unions have the ability unilaterally to control the breadth and scope of matters that will be included in a basic labor contract. Rather, during term negotiations either party has the ability and the right to bargain over any condition of employment, and it is an unfair labor practice for the other to refuse to engage in bargaining over such negotiable matters.[17] <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Interdepartmental Local 3723,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, 9 FLRA 744, 754-55 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 712 F.2d 640 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (union commits unfair labor practice when it refuses to bargain over mandatory subject of bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;Contrary to the suggestion of our dissenting colleague, we are not implying that agencies should therefore negotiate "extensive collective bargaining agreements" in order to expand the subjects covered by a term agreement. Our point is a simple one: neither agencies nor unions have the unilateral ability to control the range of matters over which the parties will bargain during term negotiations. If either party desires to preclude midterm bargaining over a negotiable matter, that party is entitled to bargain on the matter. In any event, the parties are free to jointly agree to define their midterm bargaining obligations as they see fit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, an agency is not required to bargain midterm where the union has waived its right to bargain over the subject matter involved. Waivers of bargaining rights may be established by express agreement or by bargaining history. <span class="Italic">IRS II</span>, 29 FLRA at 166. The test to analyze whether there has been a waiver by bargaining history is set out in <span class="Italic">Selfridge National Guard Base</span>, 46 FLRA at 585 (examining whether matter has been "fully discussed and consciously explored during negotiations" and whether union has "consciously yielded or otherwise clearly and unmistakably waived its interest in the matter"). The conclusion that the covered-by and waiver doctrines have heretofore adequately regulated midterm bargaining is supported by the infrequency of midterm bargaining-related litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, arguments that union-initiated midterm bargaining has been or will be harmful to the federal sector labor relations program in general, or individual labor and management relationships in particular, are unsupported and speculative. Finding that midterm bargaining is <span id="Page_1238"></span>consistent with Congress's commitment to collective bargaining in the federal sector, we hold that agencies are obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters not "contained in or covered by" the existing agreement unless the union has waived its right to bargain about the subject matter involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Union's Proposal is Within the Agency's Obligation to Bargain</p>
<p class="noindent-3">a.&#x2003;The Union's Proposal Restates a Statutory Obligation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union's proposal merely restates the statutory obligation described in the preceding section, it is within the agency's obligation to bargain. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 405 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Information Systems Command, St. Louis, Missouri</span>, 42 FLRA 1112, 1136 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b.&#x2003;The Proposal Is Not Otherwise Inconsistent with Law or Government-wide Regulation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we held in <span class="Italic">Department of Energy</span>, a proposal or provision that requires an agency to bargain midterm over union-initiated proposals concerning matters not contained in or covered by the term agreement is not inconsistent with any law or Government-wide regulation. 51 FLRA at 129. Neither the parties nor the amici have claimed that there is any law or regulation with which the proposal at issue is inconsistent. Accordingly we find that the proposal is within the agency's obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Other Matters Raised by the Parties and Amici Are Not Before the Authority in this Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties and amici have raised a number of issues relating to midterm bargaining, such as whether "zipper clauses" are a mandatory subject of negotiation, whether there may be limits on official time for midterm negotiations, and whether the Authority's current application of the "contained in or covered by doctrine" should be broadened or constricted. However, because deciding these and other related issues is not required to resolve the instant case, we will not consider them here. Resolution of these and other issues is more appropriate where the matters are squarely presented. <span class="Italic">See Navegar, Incorporated v. United States</span>, 103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (declining to decide cases before they are ripe avoids adjudicating "abstract disagreements," enhances judicial economy, and ensures that an adequate record exists to support an informed decision) (internal quotations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also, Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Renton, Washington</span>, 51 FLRA 986, 992 n.8 (1996) (recognizing that its decision left certain questions unanswered, the Authority noted that these issues could be resolved when an appropriate case is presented).</p>
<p class="noindent">The decision leading to the Supreme Court determination, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior v. FLRA</span>, 132 F.3d 157, 158-62 (4th Cir. 1997), explained the Fourth Circuit's disfavor of a uniform policy disfavoring midterm negotiations.</p>
