<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-16"><span class="space">3.</span> Objectivity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board addressed objectivity of performance standards in <span class="Italic">Shuman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 620, 626 (1984), involving a GS-7 IRS Revenue Officer. The standards measured in specific terms the qualitative determinations permitting a performance rating of "acceptable"; they did not indicate the number or frequency of errors the employee could make without receiving an unacceptable rating. The Board observed that although 5 USC 4302(c) calls for performance standards that permit the accurate evaluation of performance on the basis of objective criteria, it qualifies the requirement with the phrase "to the maximum extent feasible," and includes no requirement that quantitative criteria be written in each standard. There was no error when a standard encompassing a broad range of duties varying in complexity and significance failed to state the exact number of errors warranting an unacceptable performance rating, with the resultant subjectivity in evaluation of performance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note (as did the presiding official) that the standard permitted subjective judgments by the appellant's supervisor regarding the appropriateness of the appellant's actions as a Revenue Officer. We concur, however, in the presiding official's finding that this subjective aspect of the standard did not violate the statute, since a determination of the proper actions which were expected of a Revenue Officer was necessarily subjective in nature....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See Slama v. DHHS</span>, SF-531D-15-0266-I-4 (NP 8/24/2022) (citing <span class="italic">Diprizio v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 88 MSPR 73, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (recognizing that the degree of objectivity and specificity required in performance standards depends on the job involved and that an employee with greater discretion and independence may have less objective standards)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board summarized its view of objectivity of standards in <span class="Italic">Melnick v. DHUD</span>, 42 MSPR 93, 98 (1989): "[S]tandards may be more or less objective depending upon the job measured, but must be sufficiently specific to provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee must aim her performance." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Austin</span>, 861 F. Supp. 340 (E.D. Pa. 1994) ("Not only does it appear the standards were not applied objectively, but the standards themselves are not written in an objective manner....&#8197;[T]here is nothing in the standards indicating to plaintiff when unacceptable performance occurs with regard to any errors made"; "[T]hat it is difficult to discern exactly what is required of plaintiff shows the standards are not objective."). Additional guidance was provided in <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 305, 308-09 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, appellant asserts that the presiding official erred in interpreting the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) and failed to consider Army Regulation (AR) 690-400, Chapter 430 and <span class="Italic">A Supervisor's Guide to Developing Performance Requirements</span> in finding that his performance standards were properly established. Specifically, he contends that these provisions require the agency to specify all requirements that are relevant to a position. He contends that his standards were defective because the agency considered timeliness and quality in removing him, but did not include these factors in his standards and did not communicate them to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find that the agency violated the cited provisions in establishing appellant's performance standards. As the presiding official found, although the FPM provision states that it is a good practice to include in performance standards, if possible, specific indicators of quantity, quality, and timeliness that are used to evaluate work, it does not require all these criteria in every performance standard. The other provisions cited by appellant state: "Standards are expressed in terms of (1) Objectives, specific actions, project assignments; and (2) Other qualitative and quantitative requirements related to major job elements" and "Standards should also measure performance in as many dimensions (i.e. quantity, quality, time, cost, etc.) as are necessary and appropriate to adequately describe acceptable accomplishment." AR 690-400, Chapter 43, para. 1-; <span class="Italic">Guide,</span> para. 5e. Similarly, we find that these provisions do not require the agency to include every factor in each performance standard. Rather, they simply advise agencies to include as many factors in the standards as are necessary and appropriate for describing the job element.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we do not find that the agency abused its discretion in establishing these performance standards, even if the agency considered quality and timeliness factors not specifically cited in the standards. The Board has recognized that an agency may give content to an employee's performance standards by informing him of specific work requirements through other methods, including written instructions regarding the employee's duties, evidence that an employee was informed specifically of deficiencies in his work and of methods by which he could improve his performance, memoranda describing to an employee what constitutes unacceptable performance and agency responses to an employee's questions concerning his performance. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 614, 617 (1985). We find that the agency sufficiently informed appellant that the quality and timeliness of his work were not acceptable.</p>

SSA</span>, DE-0432-13-0091-I-1 (NP 7/3/2014) ("In considering the appellant's ePAD reviews in this manner, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's supervisor appropriately exercised his managerial discretion to determine whether the appellant processed work accurately. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v.

<p class="Body-Text">Standards can be general. The Federal Circuit approved the use of the terms "usually" and "most" in performance standards. The court rejected attempts to construe those general terms rigidly or statistically and the court affirmed the principle that objectivity in relatively general standards may be furnished through supervisors' written instructions, letters, and memos to employees. <span class="Italic">Baker v. DLA</span>, 782 F.2d 1579, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 44 MSPR 464, 467-68 (1990) (agency informed the appellant of instances of unacceptable performance and the need to improve through counseling and then through memoranda issued prior to a PIP). The qualifier "normally" seems acceptable in a standard, particularly if the standard is augmented by supervisors' directives. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sherrell v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 534, 535 (1991) ("Prepares correspondence, forms, reports, and other documents that are normally acceptable in terms of accuracy, clarity, comprehensiveness, and compliance with...regulations and directives.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Standards supplemented by supervisory instructions were sufficiently objective in <span class="Italic">Salmon v. SSA</span>, 663 F.3d 1378, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Salmon points to her 2009 Performance Plan as purportedly failing to satisfy section 4302(b). The plan laid out four "critical elements" of Ms. Salmon's position: Interpersonal Skills, Participation, Demonstrates Job Knowledge, and Achieves Business Results. Each of these "elements" was accompanied by seven to nine elaborating bullet points. For example, element 3 ("Demonstrates Job Knowledge") included bullets such as "Effectively applies knowledge and skills to meeting customer needs and expectations"; "Contributes to the success of organizational operating plans by producing high-quality work results"; and "Maintains current knowledge of SSA programs, procedures and systems through office training and review of policy and procedural updates, such as daily PolicyNet postings. Ms. Salmon argues that these metrics, and others like them in the 2009 plan and the various memoranda chronicling Ms. Salmon's path to removal, are not sufficiently "objective" to meet the requirements of section 4302(b). She would prefer, for example, numerical standards--e.g., "no more than x errors in time period y"--or some other standards of more exact application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court addressed the requirements of section 4302(b) in <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 770 F.2d 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1985). There, as here, removed employees argued that the standards applied to them were insufficiently objective. In addressing the employees' arguments, this court specifically rejected the suggestion that the term "objective criteria" in subsection (b)(1) binds the government to use only "precise quantitative or numerical standards." <span class="Italic">Wilson,</span> 770 F.2d at 1052.<span class="Italic"> Wilson</span> required only that "a standard should be sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, we think that the standards themselves were sufficiently <span id="Page_2888"></span>objective. Ms. Salmon argues that the standards were not sufficiently objective because "if [a] quantitative standard...is more based on objective criteria than [a] non-quantitative standard, the former must be used." But as we said in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, the statute does not require quantitative standards. It requires only that the standards be "sufficiently precise and specific," which, as explained below, they are here. 770 F.2d at 1052.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> clarified that the section 4302(b) analysis is not confined to the written standard. The efforts of a supervisor to instruct the employee on how best to satisfy the standard also mattered. By such instruction, "[T]he standard was [&#8197;] fleshed out and implemented in detail." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1056; <span class="Italic">see also DePauw v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm'n,</span> 782 F.2d 1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Ms. Salmon's supervisor gave direct, precise feedback on the deficiencies in Ms. Salmon's work and clear instruction on how to remedy them. In February of 2009, both women signed an OPS memorandum, prepared by the supervisor, that set forth over thirty case studies, each describing some error in Ms. Salmon's conduct and stating what should have been done. And, as discussed, the supervisor provided Ms. Salmon with a mentor to provide guidance and correction during the subsequent OPS period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of this record, we see no error in the Board's conclusion that the performance standards applied to Ms. Salmon met the requirements of section 4302(b). Those standards, by which we mean the 2009 Performance Plan in light of the supervisor's efforts at instruction, were clear, precise, and specific enough to be "objective." In other words, they were sufficient to invoke a general consensus among reasonable people in Ms. Salmon's position as to their meaning and content. We therefore find no basis for reversal in the standards' level of objectivity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Commenting on broadly-described standards (albeit not in a Chapter 43 case), <span class="Italic">Goerold v. DHS,</span> DE-0752-13-0015-I-1 (NP 4/21/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, we concur with the administrative judge that the appellant's generic performance standards, such as "analyzes information," "communicates relevant information," and "makes sound decisions," not only fail to give definition to the agency's expectations for the appellant, but are also inherently subjective and cannot provide an accurate measurement of her performance for the purposes of taking a performance-based action for cause. <span class="Italic">See Cowins</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 555; <span class="Italic">see also Graham</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 235. We also agree with the administrative judge that these standards are not achievable because they lack any benchmark by which the appellant's performance could be accurately measured or assessed. <span class="Italic">See</span> ID at 23-24 (finding unpersuasive the agency's attempt to flesh out the appellant's performance standards for communication by explaining that she should respond to emails faster); <span class="Italic">cf. Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy,</span> 362 F.3d 1329, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (explaining that an agency may not "adopt an unreasonable standard" under chapter 43).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Consider the standards for a health systems specialist's work product, "minor revisions" or "well-written," determined to be unobjectionable when coupled with guidance during the PIP, <span class="Italic">Washburn v. VA</span>, DA-0432-12-0635-I-1 (NP 2/28/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the performance standard terms "minor revisions," "occasional changes to content," and "persuasive" are impermissibly vague, and that there did not exist a general consensus as to the meaning of these terms. The record reflects that the appellant's second critical performance element, Communication, required the appellant's written products to be "well-written" and show a "sound understanding of subject matter and [a] thorough analysis of facts" through an assessment of her word choice, grammar, and conformity with professional standards, and that her work product had to be approved "by the supervisor with only minor revisions, and...only occasional substantive changes to content" in order to be rated as fully successful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that these standards are not impermissibly vague. Prior to her placement on her PIP, the appellant was counseled by her supervisor about her repeated failure to produce sound written work-product, and during her PIP review period, the appellant's supervisor counseled the appellant on several occasions about specific instances where both "moderate" and "significant" edits to her work-product had to be made, including typographical and stylistic changes and substantive revisions. We further agree with the administrative judge that, although there is an element of subjectivity in these standards, "the performance standards and the information provided to the appellant adequately advised her of what was required to improve her performance to the acceptable level." The Board has found that the use of generic terms, such as sometimes, generally, and rarely, does not render a performance standard impermissibly vague, <span class="Italic">Towne</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 22, and we agree that the agency's performance standards sufficiently informed the appellant of the minimum level of performance needed to avoid removal under chapter 43, <span class="Italic">see Van Prichard v. Department of Defense</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 18 (2011) (performance standards must "inform the appellant of what is necessary to obtain an acceptable level of performance"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 484 F. App'x 489 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The agency, moreover, provided the appellant with significant feedback during the PIP review process, thus "fleshing out the standards" the appellant was expected to meet. <span class="Italic">Towne</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the appellant's argument on review that the administrative judge misapplied <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> in upholding her performance standards. In <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, the Federal Circuit held that, although performance standards that are based entirely on an "appraiser's own subjective evaluation" are void for vagueness, "some tasks may be rated only with a certain modicum of subjective judgment." 770 F.2d at 1052, 1055. Applying these principles, the Federal Circuit rejected an open-ended performance standard which required the employee to "insure adequate service to the public" but approved performance standards which required that "[d]raft reports be completed in a timely manner...and require[d] minimum revisions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1054, 1055. We find that the administrative judge properly analogized the appellant's performance standards to the standards approved by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1055-56. We further reject the appellant's argument that a general consensus did not exist as to the meaning of the performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Towne</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 21 (Performance standards must be sufficiently precise to invoke general consensus as to their meaning and content.). The agency officials' definitions and examples of the performance standards offered during the hearing are consistent with the appellant's coworkers' understanding of those standards and demonstrate that the appellant's performance was deficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">General standards, augmented by definite objectives in a PIP, were sufficient for a GS-5 secretary, <span class="Italic">Towne v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 239, 250-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-23, 2013 MSPB 81 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the parties do not dispute, that the agency communicated the appellant's performance standards to her on several occasions. We also note that the standards set forth in the PIP were the same standards that had been contained in her position description for several years. The agency used a two-tiered rating system in which the possible ratings were "meets" and "does not meet," and the standards identify the level of performance the appellant had to achieve to reach the "meets" level. For example, under critical element 5, "Performs other clerical and administrative work in support of the office/organization," the standards provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "Typically establishes, maintains, and updates file system accurately to enable quick and efficient retrieval of information." The Board has found that an agency's use of words such as "sometimes," "rarely," "frequent," and "generally" do not automatically render a standard impermissibly vague. <span class="Italic">See Satlin</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 223-24; <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 331, 335 (1992); <span class="Italic">Rupp v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 456, 465 (1991); <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 991 F.2d 810 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). Similarly, we find that the word "typically" is not so vague as to invalidate the performance standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, when performance standards are vague on their face, the agency may cure the defect by fleshing out the standards thorough additional oral or written communication. <span class="Italic">See Dancy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 335 (citing <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). Here, any lack of specificity inherent in the appellant's performance standards was cured by the agency's provision of clear guidance in the PIP letter and throughout the PIP as to what was expected of her. <span class="Italic">See DiPrizio v. Department of Transportation</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 12 (2001). For example, under the first critical element, the appellant's performance standard provided: "Documents are routinely finalized in a timely manner, meeting prescribed suspense dates or established deadlines." The agency fleshed out this standard in the PIP notice as follows: "Accurately finalize and route documents by established suspense dates of 5 days following meetings for draft minutes and and [sic] 10 days prior to meeting [sic] for agendas." Another example appears under critical element 4: "Typically maintains calendar efficiently and promptly informs supervisor of any changes or conflicts." In the PIP notice, the agency fleshed out this standard thusly:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Schedule appointments and meetings without prior approval in accordance with supervisor's policies and priorities, and coordinate with supervisor as necessary. This includes all newly assigned nurses and nuses [sic] scheduled for career counseling. Inform supervisor of conflicts and reschedules appointments when it is clear that the supervisor will not be able to make all commitments. If a supervisor can't attend a scheduled meeting, contact an alternate person when necessary. No more than one incorrect entry will be acceptable per week.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we do not explicitly address each relevant standard here, we have carefully reviewed them and find that they are all substantially similar to the examples mentioned here, requiring the same analysis and leading to the same conclusion. We find that the agency has shown by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance standards are reasonable, realistic, attainable, reasonably objective, and tailored to the specific requirements of the position. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Department of <span id="Page_2889"></span>Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 13, &#x00B6; 13 (2004); <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 123, &#x00B6; 12. Thus, the agency has met its burden of proving by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance standards are valid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. DOJ</span>, DC-0432-12-0494-I-1 (NP 4/25/2014) (relying on <span class="Italic">Towne, supra</span>: "The Board has found that an agency's usage of words such as 'sometimes,' 'rarely,' 'frequently,' 'generally,' and 'typically' are not so vague as to invalidate the performance standard.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Broadly stated standards, augmented by more specific PIP requirements, were permitted, <span class="Italic">Moltzen v. Dept. of Labor,</span> SF-0432-10-0994-I-1 (NP 4/6/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here, the use of the phrase "with some exceptions" was capable of being, and was, in fact, clarified through subsequent agency communication. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DePauw v. U.S. International Trade Commission</span>, 782 F.2d 1564, 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (finding language such as "usually" and "few" sufficient to "pass muster" because the work called for subjective evaluation and the agency detailed its expectations of the appellant); <span class="Italic">Satlin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 218, 223-24 (1993) (the use of terms such as "sometimes" and "rarely" were not <span class="Italic">per se</span> invalid, the appellant's work involved subjective judgment, and the agency satisfactory quantified the rating process); <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 331, 335 (1992) (the terms "frequent," "poor quality," and "good quality" were susceptible to further clarification by management in day-to-day communications with the employee). We agree with the administrative judge that the agency cured any vagueness in the standard by communicating sufficient information regarding the performance requirements at the beginning of the PIP and throughout the PIP period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is difficult to determine where the Board will draw the line. As a benchmark, the Board dropped a footnote in a Chapter 75 case stating that "the degree of specificity and objectivity required of a performance standard varies inversely to the amount of discretion and independence reposed in the incumbent of the position." <span class="Italic">Graham v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 227, 236 n.7 (1990). <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 27 MSPR 605, 606 n.* (1985), apparently blessed a performance standard for a teacher (that the appellant apparently met) barring frequent teacher absence from the classroom: "[T]he omission of specific numerical criteria does not preclude an agency from rating an employee's performance unacceptable on that basis when the agency can show that this aspect of the employee's work is not susceptible of mechanical, judgment-free rating...and in this case we find that the agency has made such a showing." But standards can be too subjective to pass muster, <span class="Italic">Russell v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-0432-13-0335-I-1 (NP 12/16/2014) (GS-11 Supply Systems Analyst):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Assuming, however, that the appellant needed only to improve his communication skills and attitude, such an objective is invalid because it does not describe in sufficient detail what is required of the appellant and how it will be measured. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (standards must be sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to their meaning and content and provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee may aim performance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Standards can be detailed. Performance standards will not be overturned because they are extremely detailed, if the justification is that the supervisor and appellant have had a long-standing dispute over the standards. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Educ.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3025). Although (now extinct) FPM provisions stated that it is a good practice to include in performance standards, if possible, specific indicators of quantity, quality, and timeliness that are used to evaluate work, the FPM did not require all of those criteria in every performance standard. The requirement is for agencies to include as many factors in the standards as are necessary and appropriate for the job element. <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 537 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The subjective/objective problem was addressed in as to a GS-11 Revenue Officer's appeal, <span class="Italic">Evans v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 366, 368 n.3 (1985). The standards were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Properly and timely completes a quality examination of taxpayer's books and records in sufficient depth to fully develop the relevant facts on issues of merit in accordance with manual guidelines, training provided, and sound auditing/examination principles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Correctly expands or limits the scope of the examination and correctly channels fact-finding techniques toward the purpose of the examination--significant items necessary for a correct determination of the tax liability have been considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Correctly develops and documents facts and/or evidence obtained through inspection, inquiry and analysis of records to insure full development of relevant facts concerning issues of merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;Properly applies techniques to detect unreported income, if any, and exercises alertness in detecting indications of fraud.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency witnesses testified that strictly quantitative, totally objective standards could not be developed for the appellant's position. They also testified concerning the discretion and individual judgment involved with the position, the six weeks of training each revenue agent received, and the manuals, directives, and published announcements available to the revenue agents as references. Of this the Board said, <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, 28 MSPR at 369:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) require that objective performance standards be established to the maximum extent feasible. That some performance standards necessarily involve subjective aspects does not necessarily invalidate such standards....&#8197;Appellant's position involves professional judgment which is not susceptible to a mechanical rating system, and we cannot say that the agency acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in establishing performance standards which included the judgment of appellant's supervisors in rating appellant's performance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Evans</span> was applied to a GS-6 Accounting Technician position: "where a position involves the exercise of professional judgment and is not susceptible to a mechanical rating system, the agency does not act unreasonably in establishing standards that depend on the judgment of supervisors in rating performance." <span class="Italic">Poe v. USDA</span>, 45 MSPR 678, 686 (1990); <span class="Italic">Benavides v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 468, 471 (1990) (training instructor: a professional position requiring the exercise of professional judgment, was not subject to a mechanical rating system).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not measure permissible degrees of standards' subjectivity. It is not enough, for example, to show that standards could have been written more objectively--despite the statutory command that standards be objective to the maximum extent feasible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. EPA</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1056 n.6 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 537 (1992) ("The fact that a performance standard could be more objective than it is does not, <span class="Italic">per se,</span> make it impermissibly subjective."); <span class="Italic">Bronfman v. GSA</span>, 40 MSPR 184, 190 (1989) ("[A] performance standard is not invalid simply because it could have been written more precisely."); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 30 MSPR 243, 247-48 (1986) (enforcing standard at a satisfactory level that there be "no more than two valid problems" noted as to components of the appellant's work during an appraisal period); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. DHHS</span>, 29 MSPR 201, 203 (1985) ("Here, even if the written standard could have been more precise, we find that there could be no doubt that the appellant's error rate was unacceptable"). But if the standard is capable of precise definition, as for a voucher examiner, and the employee is not told what actually is required for satisfactory performance, the action is invalid. <span class="Italic">Goodale v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 28 MSPR 158, 160 (1985) ("there is no evidence of record that the agency informed appellant of the degree to which her performance would have to improve in order to avoid removal").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 49 MSPR 110, 115 (1991), involving a Chapter 43 action against a GS-12 Accountant, the "void for vagueness" standard was, at the marginal level, that "[r]ewrite may <span class="Italic">sometimes</span> be required on products dealing with complex multi-faceted issues; [<span class="Italic">s</span>] <span class="Italic">ometimes</span> has difficulty in conveying position regarding complex ideas, concepts, and situations." A supervisor testified that, although the appellant was allowed to have rewrites and difficulty in communicating his ideas, the supervisor did not discuss specifically with the appellant the number of rewrites that would be acceptable or the amount of difficulty in communicating his ideas that the appellant would be allowed. The supervisor's ratings on other critical elements were inconsistent with the rating on the element. The appellant prevailed. Chairman Levinson's concurring opinion commented that "[f]ew aspects of a professional's responsibilities are less susceptible to mechanical, non-judgmental evaluation than the ability to communicate with others." <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 49 MSPR at 121. But the terms "sometimes" and "rarely" do not automatically render a standard impermissibly vague. There is no requirement that every trace of subjective judgment be wrung out of a standard in favor of numerical measurements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Satlin v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 218, 223-24 (1993) (sustaining demotion of an attorney-examiner; also condoning the use of "sometimes" and "rarely" in standards).

<p class="Body-Text">If standards are not outrageously indefinite and if one gets right down to evaluating what proof is necessary for employees to show that certain standards do not meet statutory criteria, the Board provides little guidance. An appellant's coworkers who worked under the same standards testified that the standards were arbitrary and unrealistic. The evidence was not entitled to great weight. As to objectivity, the Board did not find the terms "substantive corrections" or "extensive editorial revisions" in a standard so vague as to be an abuse of discretion. Nor did the fact that the standards were replaced mean that they were, prior to modification, unworkable or arbitrary. <span class="Italic">Benton v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 430, 434-35 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Poe v.

Interestingly, if the appellant contends that standards cannot be met, the Board accepts evidence proffered by management that other employees were able to meet the same standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v.
