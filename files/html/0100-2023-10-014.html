<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-16"><span class="space">h.</span> Adjudicators</h5>
<p class="noindent">An individual was not a manager who had no authority to make final agency adjudicative decisions, but who made recommendations and prepared draft decisions reviewed and edited prior to issuance. He implemented law and regulation by following policy formulated by others and only made recommendations regarding proposed changes in regulations. He was a professional whose actions assisted in implementing, not shaping agency policy. <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 16 FLRA 390, 392 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Crop Ins. Corp., Wash. Reg'l Office and NFFE Local 858</span>, 46 FLRA 1457, 1458-59 (1993) (including within unit position of Hearing Officer, Appeals &#x0026; Litigation Branch: the incumbent could recommend but not direct or commit agency to a certain course of action); <span class="Italic">MSPB and MSPB Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 12 FLRA 137, 140 (1983) (unit included "appeals officers" [judges]; management did not include GS-905 attorneys in Board's OGC; they made recommendations to Board members, including advisory opinions on issues related to MSPB adjudicatory authority); <span class="Italic">EEOC and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals 216, AFGE</span>, 9 FLRA 973, 975 (1982) (GS-13 Appeals Officers were not managers).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management included individuals who made agency policy through adjudication of individual cases when the decisions they issued were administratively final. Excluded from a unit in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bd. of Immigration Appeals and AFGE Local 3525</span>, 47 FLRA 505, 508-09 (1993) (<span class="Italic">BIA</span>), were attorney-examiners designated as Members of the Board of Immigration Appeals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that compelling reasons exist to grant the application for review insofar as it alleges that there is an absence of Authority precedent on the issue of whether policy, within the meaning of section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute, may be established through the issuance of administrative decisions, and whether an individual who issues such decisions is a management official....&#8197;We conclude, in this regard, that Board decisions establish the Activity's immigration policies and that the incumbent Board Member is a management official because he influences those policies through his participation in Board decisions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A management official is defined in section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute as "an individual employed by an agency in a position the duties and responsibilities of which require or authorize the individual to formulate, determine, or influence the policies of the agency[.]" As the RD noted, management officials are individuals who: (1) create, establish or prescribe general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency; (2) decide upon or settle upon general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency; or (3) bring about or obtain a result as to the adoption of general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency. <span class="Italic">Navy/ADP</span>, 7 FLRA at 177.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Navy/ADP</span> criteria, the RD found that the incumbent Board Member was a management official because his "judgments and decisions in [immigration] cases...influence and determine the Board's policies within the meaning of section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute." In this connection, the RD found that the Board is a "quasi-judicial organization...[which] issues administrative decisions [by] interpret[ing] the immigration laws and establish[es] precedent in the area of administrative immigration law." The RD also found that "Board [decisions are] essentially the final administrative ruling on the case" and "have the effect of law unless overruled by the courts."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the RD findings. Instead, the Union argues that "administrative case law is distinct from policy, and, therefore, the adjudicators of that case law are not management officials." According to the Union, although "agency rule[-]making involves the adoption of broad, generally applicable guidelines based upon considerations of <span id="Page_18"></span>policy[,]...adjudicatory decisions...are based upon particular facts and information, and have an immediate affect [sic] upon the interests of [the]...parties."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's position, nothing in the wording of section 7103(a)(11) or its legislative history indicates that agency policy may be established solely through agency rule-making. In this case, Congress has conferred on the Board the power to "exercise such discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by law as is appropriate and necessary for the disposition of the case." <span class="Italic">See</span> 8 CFR 3.1(d)(1). Both the RD and the Union agree that the Attorney General reviews Board decisions infrequently, that a decision of the Board is "the final administrative ruling on the case[,]" and that a Board decision is "binding [on] the Immigration Judges...[the] District Directors of the [INS] as well as the State Department." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 8 CFR 3.1(d)(2). In this case, the Board has broad discretionary power to administer the immigration laws through the issuance of precedential and non-precedential final decisions. The Board's implementation of precedent in future Board cases effectively creates and establishes general agency principles which guide the outcome of future immigration decisions and establish Activity policy. For these reasons, we reject the Union's claim that the Activity's policies may not be established through the Board's decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, there is no question that individual Board Members substantially influence and determine the Activity's immigration policy. It is undisputed that the Board "reviews approximately 1,000 decision[s] per month[,] [and] [e]ach member of the Board makes an individual decision on each case[.]" It is also undisputed that the Board Member's votes are not "supervised nor subject to change" within the Activity. We conclude that the incumbent Board Member directly influences Activity policy through his participation in the interpretation of immigration laws and the issuance of decisions and, thereby, meets the definition of a management official set forth in section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The unit status of immigration judges suffered a reversal of fortunes in 2020 when FLRA switched positions and excluded the judges from unit status. In 2000, FLRA determined that a unit included immigration judges who issued nonprecedential decisions and who had some responsibilities concerning the development of rules of practice and case control, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Exec. Office of Immigration Review and Nat'l Ass'n of Immigration Judges</span>, 56 FLRA 616, 621-23 (2000), distinguishing <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency does not dispute, and indeed specifically acknowledges, that the central duties of an Immigration Judge have remained essentially unchanged since the unit was certified in 1979. Instead, the Agency's contention that Immigration Judges now function as management officials is predicated on the fact that there have been various changes in their duties and responsibilities since that time. These changes...include the Judges' authority to develop local rules governing practice in their courts; the participation of some Judges on advisory committees to the Office of the Chief Immigration Judge; the Judges' opportunity to review and comment on OPPMs before they become final; the opportunity to participate in the court evaluation system; and the opportunity of more experienced Judges to serve as faculty members for the National Judicial College.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the Agency's contention, we find that there is an abundance of Authority case law offering guidance with respect to how the Judges' new duties and responsibilities should be evaluated. Such cases include <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, Washington Regional Office and National Federation of Federal Employees</span>, 46 FLRA 1457, 1458-59 (1993) (finding that hearing officers were not management officials because their recommendations were reviewed by a number of higher levels and because they did not have the authority to direct or commit the agency to a certain course of action) and <span class="Italic">Headquarters, Space Division, Air Force Systems Command, Department of the Air Force, Department of Defense and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2429</span>, 9 FLRA 885, 887-88 (1982) (finding that employees who wrote and independently interpreted regulations that set forth agency policy were management officials). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Boston Regional Office, Region I Boston, Massachusetts and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3258, AFL-CIO</span>, 16 FLRA 38 (1984) (finding that attorneys at the GM-14 level who engaged in litigation on behalf of the agency and provided legal expertise and interpretation of the agency's policies were engaged in implementing, as opposed to shaping, the agency's policies and therefore were not management officials).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, the Authority affirmed the RD's determination that a member of the Board of Immigration Appeals was a management official within the meaning of section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute and, therefore, could not be included in the existing bargaining unit. In particular, the Authority concluded that "the incumbent Board Member directly influences Activity policy through his participation in the interpretation of immigration laws and the issuance of decisions and, thereby, meets the definition of a management official set forth in section 7103(a)(11) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 47 FLRA at 509. In so concluding, the Authority found significant various powers conferred upon members of the Board. These included the power to "'exercise such discretion and authority conferred upon the Attorney General by law as is appropriate and necessary for the disposition of the case.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 8 CFR &#x00A7; 3.1(d)(2)). The Authority further included the power to issue the final administrative ruling in a case, and to bind the Immigration Judges, District Directors of the INS, as well as the State Department, through the issuance of such rulings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">BIA</span> to the facts of this case, the RD concluded that unlike decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals, the decisions of Immigration Judges are not published, do not constitute precedent, are binding only on the parties to the proceedings, and are subject to <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. The RD accordingly concluded that the decisions of the Judges do not influence and determine the Agency's immigration policy, in contrast to the decisions of the Board. In our view, the RD's application of <span class="Italic">BIA</span> to the facts of this case, including, particularly, the new duties identified by the Agency, was entirely appropriate and fully supported by the evidence. As such, we find that this contention fails to provide a basis for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the RD correctly applied relevant Authority precedent as set forth in such cases as <span class="Italic">DOE, Headquarters</span> and <span class="Italic">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</span> in determining that Immigration Judges do not formulate the Agency's national or local immigration policy. Contrary to the Agency, we find that both of these cases directly support the RD's determination that the Judges' participation on the advisory committees and court evaluation teams established well after the initial certification of the unit is not sufficient to influence the determination of Agency policy in the circumstances of this case. We note, in this connection, that in <span class="Italic">DOE</span>, <span class="Italic">Headquarters</span>, 40 FLRA at 270, the Authority concluded that attorneys who served on the agency's committees and panels were engaged in these activities as resource persons providing technical expertise, rather than as management officials formulating or effectively influencing the agency's policy. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</span>, 7 FLRA at 648, the Authority determined that employees who analyzed data, discussed their findings and ultimately prepared preliminary recommendations regarding proposed agency regulations were simply experts or professionals who rendered resource information with respect to agency policies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case the RD specifically found that the record includes no evidence of any immigration policy or directive issued by an advisory committee or as a result of its deliberations. The RD also found that the record contains no evidence to establish that Immigration Judges who participate in the court evaluation program serve in a capacity that is any greater than or different from other court personnel who also participate in the program. According to the RD, Agency employees who perform such <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> tasks in these and other such activities are not establishing Agency policy but are simply providing expertise as highly trained professionals. In our view, the RD's findings in this regard are fully supported by relevant Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, the private sector cases cited by the Agency do not support its claim. <span class="Italic">Bell Aerospace</span> [416 U.S. 267 (1974)] does not assess the status of the buyers who were at issue in that case. Rather, the Supreme Court simply ruled that the Board could not limit the category of managerial employees to those with a conflict of interest. The decision in <span class="Italic">Yeshiva University</span> relies on facts that are quite different from those presented in the instant case. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Yeshiva</span> ruled that the faculty members of the university were "managerial" based upon clear evidence that a collegial system of decision-making yielded "shared authority." <span class="Italic">Yeshiva University</span>, 444 U.S. at 680. The managerial authority of faculty members extended to such matters as the determination of the curriculum, grading system, and academic calendars, as well as decisions on hiring, tenure, sabbaticals, termination and promotion for teachers, and enrollment levels, absence policies and tuition for students<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 676-77. As such, we conclude that the RD did not err in failing to address the private sector precedent argued by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">Times and FLRA composition changed. Immigration judges were excluded from bargaining rights (bargaining units) in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Exec.

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Statement of the Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the attached decision and order (decision), Federal Labor Relations Authority Regional Director Jessica S. Bartlett (the RD) denied the Agency's petition to clarify the bargaining unit (the unit) to exclude all immigration judges (IJs) on the grounds that they are management officials and therefore not appropriate unit members under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute). <span id="Page_19"></span>The RD found that changed circumstances existed to support a re-examination of the Authority's finding that the unit could include IJs. Despite the changed circumstances, the RD found that the unit was still appropriate because IJs are not management officials. The Agency filed an application for review of the RD's decision. After a thorough review of the record, including the Union's opposition and the <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> from the Association of Administrative Law Judges, the Authority finds that existing case law warrants reconsideration. As such, we grant the application for review, find that IJs are management officials, and, therefore, exclude them from the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Background and RD's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2000, in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review, Office of the Chief Immigration Judge</span> (<span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>),[3] the Authority denied a petition by the Agency to clarify the unit by excluding IJs on the grounds that IJs are management officials. Since then, the number of cases pending before IJs and decided each year has significantly increased. Furthermore, the Agency codified "adopt-and-affirm" and "affirmance with opinion" procedures, and changed the level of review of IJ factual determinations from <span class="Italic">de novo</span> to a clear error standard. Moreover, the Supreme Court of the United States decided <span class="Italic">Lucia v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span> (<span class="Italic">Lucia</span>), finding that Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) at the Securities Exchange Commission were officers of the United States under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;56 FLRA 616, 623 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Lucia v. SEC</span>, 138 S. Ct. 2044, 2054 (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, the Agency filed the clarification petition at issue in this case, seeking to overturn the decision in <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span> based on the changed circumstances. After considering the petition and the Union's response, the RD found that the IJs' day&#8209;to&#8209;day duties remain largely unchanged since the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>. The RD also found that the processes for "adopt-and-affirm" and "affirmance without opinion" existed in practice prior to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>. The RD further found that <span class="Italic">Lucia</span> did not have any bearing on whether IJs were management officials under the Statute. However, the RD found that the regulatory change to the level of review of IJs' factual determinations was a substantial change that warranted a "thorough[&#8197;] reassess[ment]" of the IJs' status. Therefore, the RD reevaluated whether IJs are management officials under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that, although the Agency deferred to the IJs' factual findings under a clear error standard, IJs "continue[d] to make decisions based on the facts presented and in accordance with law, regulation, and precedential [Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)] decisions." The RD further found that IJs' decisions are still reviewed by the BIA, and IJs are bound by BIA precedent and policy. As such, the RD found that IJs merely apply the laws, policies, regulations, and BIA decisions, and, therefore, do not create and influence policy. Based on these findings, the RD concluded that IJs are not management officials under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c) of the Authority's regulations, the Authority may grant review when the application demonstrates that: (1) the RD's decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent; (2) established law or policy warrants reconsideration; or (3) there is a genuine issue over which the RD has: failed to apply established law, committed a prejudicial procedural error, or committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter. Further, the Authority has recognized that a party may not collaterally attack a previous unit certification.[9] Therefore, a party must demonstrate that substantial changes have altered the scope and character of the unit since the last certification to show that a previously certified unit is no longer appropriate.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The RD's unchallenged finding of a substantial change calls for a re&#8209;examination of the appropriateness of the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that the RD found that a substantial change existed in this case, and that the existence of a substantial change required a "thorough[&#8197;] reassess[ment]" of the IJs' status as management officials. Further, the Union did not file an application for review to challenge either of those findings. Therefore, we may evaluate the merits of the Agency's arguments regarding the appropriateness of the unit without running afoul of the bar on collaterally attacking a previous unit certification.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 70 FLRA at 328.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD's decision raises an issue for which there is an absence of precedent; however, we find that it does not affect the appropriateness of the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that there is a lack of precedent on whether "[o]fficers" under the Constitution are management officials under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11). They assert that because IJs are "[o]fficers" under the Constitution, they are automatically management officials under the Statute. The Agency is correct that the Authority has not considered whether "officers" under the Constitution are management officials. However, we disagree with the Agency's assertion, and agree with the Union that Lucia is irrelevant in the management official determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(11) defines management officials as "an individual employed by an agency in a position the <span class="Italic">duties and responsibilities</span> of which require or authorize the individual to formulate, determine, or influence the policies of an agency." Further, the Authority has long held that the statutory definition of management official includes individuals who:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;create, establish or prescribe general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency; (2) decide upon or settle upon general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency; or (3) bring about or obtain a result as to the adoption of general principles, plans or courses of action for an agency.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Automatic Data Processing Selection Office</span>, 7 FLRA 172, 177 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of the Statute and the expanded definition adopted by the Authority do not consider how an individual's employment starts--whether appointed, competitive selection, or other method--but instead look at the duties and responsibilities of the individual to determine if he or she is a management official under the Statute. Therefore, whether IJs are "officers" under the Constitution is not relevant in determining if they are or are not management officials. Consequently, this issue does not provide a basis for overturning the RD's decision.[18]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;The Agency also argues there is a lack of precedent on whether employees who adjudicate decisions that bind the agency are management officials because they "influence the policies of the agency." However, the Agency's assertion is incorrect. As evidenced in the RD's decision and the Agency's application, the Authority has considered this issue before. Decision at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>, 56 FLRA at 622, for the proposition that IJs were not management officials even though they conducted formal, quasi-judicial proceedings); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 17 (citing <span class="Italic">USDA, Fed. Crop Ins. Corp., Wash. Reg'l Office</span>, 46 FLRA 1457, 1466 (1993), for the proposition that an employee was a management official if they had the authority to bind the agency); <span class="Italic">id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Nat'l Credit Union Admin</span>., 59 FLRA 858, 861-62 (2004), for the proposition that employees who assigned ratings to credit union based on established criteria as well as their professional judgement were not found to be management officials); <span class="Italic">id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Contract Mgmt. Command, Def. Contract Mgmt. Dist. N. Cent</span>., 48 FLRA 285, 290 (1993), for the proposition that employees who interpreted regulatory and policy guidance and had some decision-making authority within that framework were not management officials); Application at 3 (arguing that "the Authority should apply and re-affirm its decision in [<span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Bd. of Immigration Appeals</span>]," 47 FLRA 505 (1993) (<span class="Italic">BIA</span>)). Therefore, this assertion does not justify disturbing the RD's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Established Authority precedent warrants reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span> needs to be reconsidered because it is in conflict with <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Board of Immigration Appeals</span> (<span class="Italic">BIA</span>).[19] We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;47 FLRA at 509; Application at 34-42. The Agency also argues that "substantial intervening changes in the character of IJ[s'] duties have occurred since <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 27-33. This argument is the same argument required to justify a re-examination of a previously certified unit. <span class="Italic">Wright&#8209;Patterson AFB</span>, 70 FLRA at 328. As such, the argument does not raise a separate ground for review under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(c), but merely demonstrates that re-examination of the certified unit was required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BIA</span>, the Authority found that Board Members of the BIA were management officials because each "Board Member directly influences [Agency] policy through his [or her] participation in the interpretation of immigration laws and the issuance of decisions."[20] The Authority also emphasized that Board Members "ha[ve] broad discretionary power to administer the immigration laws through the issuance of precedential and non-precedential final decisions."[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 47 FLRA at 509.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>, the Authority held that IJs were not management officials because they did not influence the agency's policy, but merely implemented the policy.[22] Further, the Authority distinguished IJs from Board Members of the BIA.[23] This distinction was based on the fact that IJ decisions were reviewable by the BIA and, according to the Authority, merely implemented the policy and precedent set by the BIA.[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>, 56 FLRA at 621-22.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority in <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span> failed to recognize the significance of IJ decisions and how those decisions influence Agency policy. IJ decisions influence the policy of the Agency for similar reasons that Board Member decisions influence the policy of the Agency. Just like <span class="Italic">BIA</span> where the Authority found that Board Members influence the policy of the Agency by interpreting immigration laws and making decisions,[25] IJs also influence the policy of the Agency by interpreting immigration laws when they apply the law and existing precedent to the unique facts of each case.[26]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BIA</span>, 47 FLRA at 509.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;Opp'n Br. at 16 (IJs "take testimony, receive evidence, and decide the individual cases before them."); <span class="Italic">id.</span> (IJs are "required to apply binding law and precedent to the facts of the <span class="Italic">individual case</span> and to <span class="Italic">render a decision</span>." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000</span>, we conclude that IJs influence the policy of the Agency in the decisions they render, just as Board Members influence the Agency's policy in the decisions they render. Arguing that IJs' decisions do not influence Agency policy while Board Member decisions do is akin to arguing that district court decisions do not shape the law while appellate court decisions do. Such a distinction, based on what appears to be solely the reviewability of decisions, is nonsensical.[27], [28] As such, we find that IJs are management officials under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11), and, therefore, are excluded from the bargaining unit pursuant to &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;Moreover, we note that IJs do review the decisions of Department of Homeland Security officials in two classes of cases called "reasonable fear" and "credible fear" reviews. In this way, IJs are similar to Board Members. And although the BIA may review IJs' decisions in many cases, the BIA's decisions are also subject to review--by both the Attorney General and the federal judiciary. Therefore, both IJs and Board Members review others' decisions, and issue decisions that higher-level authorities may subject to additional review. These similarities further undermine <span class="Italic">EOIR 2000's</span> conclusion that IJs are not management officials, but Board Members are.</p>
