<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-14"><span class="space">2.</span> Failure to Request Hearing</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulations require, 5 CFR 1201.24(a)(3), (e) (2022), that a hearing request be filed or designated on the appeal filed by the appellant; if the request is not properly made, it is waived. Under 5 CFR 1201.24(e) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must submit any request for a hearing with the appeal, or within any other time period the judge sets for that purpose. If the appellant does not make a timely request for a hearing, the right to a hearing is waived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ may, on motion, waive the regulatory requirement concerning the manner and time that the hearing is requested. 5 CFR 1201.12 (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides some guidance concerning appellants' hearing requests, at Chapter 4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">HEARING REQUESTS</span>. A hearing must be held if the appellant requests one and the appeal is timely filed and within the Board's jurisdiction. While case law and aspects of the Board's regulations have changed over time, the rules concerning the burdens and degree of proof necessary to support jurisdiction, merits, and affirmative defense determinations are set out at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.56, 1201.57. When it is unchallenged that an appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, the appellant has the right to a hearing if he requests one. When jurisdiction is at issue, the regulations provide that for all but four types of appeals the appellant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence as defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(q) before entitlement to an appeal is established. As to (1) IRA appeals, (2) appeals under VEOA, (3) USERRA, and (4) restoration to duty appeals following military service or recovery from a compensable injury, except for proving exhaustion of a required statutory complaint process and standing to appeal (<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.57(c)(1) and (c)(3)), to establish jurisdiction, an appellant who initiates such an appeal must make nonfrivolous allegations concerning the substantive jurisdictional elements applicable to the particular type of appeal. The definition of nonfrivolous allegation is in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to all types of appeals, timeliness must ultimately be established by a preponderance of the evidence but an appellant who raises a nonfrivolous allegation as to the timeliness of an appeal is also entitled to a hearing if there is a material factual question involved. <span class="Italic">See Meyer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 667 (1998). In addition, the AJ has the discretion to grant a request for a hearing on a motion for attorney fees or a petition for enforcement, and in VEOA appeals (in USERRA appeals, the appellant has a right to a hearing after jurisdiction is established). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Popham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 193 (1991) (threshold timeliness and jurisdictional determinations); <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Department of Interior</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 582, 584 (1991) (the appellant has the right to a hearing; the agency and the AJ do not, except as provided in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.45(b)(5)); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1208.13(b), 1208.23(b). The hearing may be in person, or within the limitations discussed below, by telephone, or by video conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as it is the appellant's right to have a hearing, the Board has held that if the appellant chooses to waive that right, the AJ may not require that a hearing be held. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Grimes v. General Services Administration</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 244 (1999). Nor does the agency have a right to a hearing when the appellant rejects the opportunity to have one. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359 (2000). Of course, the AJ retains the right to have the parties develop the record on issues that must be decided, but despite 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5), which states that an AJ may order a hearing on his or her initiative, the cases listed here render that provision moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">CONDITIONAL OR AMBIGUOUS REQUESTS</span>. If the appellant makes a conditional or ambiguous request for a hearing, the AJ must issue an order granting the appellant a specific time to make an unequivocal election. The appellant must be advised that if the right to a hearing is waived, an opportunity to submit written evidence and argument will be provided. This information may also be provided by means of a telephonic conference with subsequent documentation. In any event, the waiver must be clear and unequivocal, and the record must reflect that it is.</p>

OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 511, 512 (1995), "[s]trong policy considerations favor that an appellant receive a hearing on the merits of his case, and the right to a hearing may be waived by implication only if there is a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act showing such a purpose." Although the employee has a right to a hearing, the hearing is not automatic. The employee must request one. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collins v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3015); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. DHHS</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("The...petitioners' failure to make the submissions the presiding official requested also may be viewed as a waiver of any right they may have had to a hearing."). If a hearing is not requested, the appeal is adjudicated on the record.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant states on the appeal form that he does not desire a hearing, the hearing is waived. <span class="Italic">Pecukonis v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 411, 415 (1987) (counsel, who later entered an appearance, did not request a hearing after the AJ notified counsel that the appellant did not request a hearing and that counsel should contact the AJ with questions concerning the processing of the appeal); <span class="Italic">Howell v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 321, 322 (1986) ("Appellant, who was represented by legal counsel, declined a hearing on the appeals form, and this constituted a clear, unequivocal and decisive act showing a purpose amounting to estoppel on her part."). An initially ambiguous request (the "yes" box checked on the appeal form's hearing request, marked out with the notation "I don't know yet," followed by a motion for additional time noting a hearing request), was sufficient to preserve the right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 94 MSPR 262, 268 &#x00B6; 16 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The filing of an appeal does not constitute a request for a hearing or otherwise satisfy the Board's requirement that an appellant affirmatively request a hearing. <span class="Italic">Dubose v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 252, 255 (1990). The hearing is waived if the appellant does not state on the appeal form or in response to an acknowledgment order that he desires a hearing, <span class="Italic">Wasserman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 66 MSPR 391 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge decided this case on the written record because he found that the appellant did not elect a hearing even after he had been given the opportunity to do so. On review, however, the appellant states that he wanted a telephonic hearing but was never afforded the opportunity. The record does not support the appellant's contention. As the administrative judge found, the appellant did not check off the box on the appeal form indicating that he wanted a hearing on the merits of his appeal, and he did not respond to the notice given him in the acknowledgment order that he had 10 days to request a hearing. Nor did he request a hearing in either of the two submissions that he made after the issuance of the acknowledgment order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board requires that an appellant make an affirmative request for a hearing. The right to a hearing is waived if the appellant does not request one after being placed on notice that such a request is necessary. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.24(e); <span class="Italic">Nugent v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 59 MSPR 444, 446 (1993), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 36 F.3d 1107 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Nugent</span>, the Board held that the appellant waived his right to a hearing when, as in this case, he failed to check either of the appropriate boxes on the petition for appeal form to indicate whether or not he wanted a hearing, and did not respond affirmatively to an acknowledgment order that specifically informed him that he would waive his right to a hearing if he did not request one within 10 days of the order. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 447. Here, there is nothing in the record to support the appellant's statement in his petition for review that he requested a telephonic or any other kind of hearing. We therefore find that he waived his right to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ need not grant a hearing belatedly requested during a status conference, <span class="Italic">Nugent v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 444, 446-47 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the administrative judge erred by denying his counsel's alleged request for a hearing first made at the May 25, 1993 telephonic status conference. There is no evidence in the record of such a request. Neither is there any evidence that the appellant's counsel preserved an objection to the alleged ruling for the Board's review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 47 MSPR 297, 302-03 (1991). Nevertheless, we will consider this issue because there is a strong policy consideration that an appellant receive a hearing on the merits of a case, and the right to a hearing can only be waived by implication if there is a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act showing such purpose. <span class="Italic">Apiado v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 33, 35 (1993); <span class="Italic">Coben v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 168, 169-70 (1991); <span class="Italic">Sincero v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 239, 243 (1989). The Board, however, requires that an appellant make an affirmative request for a hearing, and an appellant waives a right to a hearing upon failure to request one after being placed on notice that such a request is necessary. <span class="Italic">Dubose v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 252, 255 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not check either of the appropriate boxes on the petition for appeal form to indicate whether or not he wanted a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.24(a)(3). The appellant contends on review that his failure to so indicate was due to a last-minute change on the appeal form and an omission by his former representative. We note, however, that the administrative judge specifically informed the appellant in his April 28, 1993 acknowledgment order that, if he did not request a hearing, he had 10 days in which to submit a written request for one, and that, if he did not do so, he would waive his right to a hearing and the parties would be afforded an opportunity to make written submissions before the record closed. Nevertheless, neither the appellant nor his representative raised the issue of a hearing until they allegedly did so at the May 25, 1993 telephonic status conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant failed to request a hearing by May 8, 1993, after being specifically placed on notice that such a request was necessary, he waived his right to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 412, 416-17 (1991); <span class="Italic">Dubose</span>, 45 MSPR at 255. Moreover, an appellant is responsible for the actions or omissions of his chosen representative, and the Board will generally not consider an appellant's allegations of misconduct or neglect by his representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 505, 507 (1987); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). Thus, we find that the administrative judge properly denied as untimely the appellant's alleged request for a hearing made for the first time at the May 25, 1993 telephonic status conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At one point, Board practice was that if a hearing was not requested in the appeal, the AJ should provide the appellant written notice of the right to a hearing, explaining how the appellant could request the hearing. This notification was generally accomplished through an acknowledgment order. <span class="Italic">Mills v. DHEW</span>, 3 MSPR 30, 31, 3 MSPB 151 (1980). The hearing waiver clause of the regulation was added years after <span class="Italic">Mills</span>. Regions may send out a notice reminding an appellant of a hearing right and how to request it, but it can be assumed that the hearing is waived if it is not requested in the appeal. It is better to request the hearing initially if there is any doubt as to whether one is desired, and waive it later if that is the appellant's choice. Even if the appellant does not initially request a hearing in his appeal, if the AJ's acknowledgment order states that the appellant may request a hearing within a set period of time, the hearing is not waived if the appellant then makes a timely request. <span class="Italic">Coben v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 168, 170 (1991). If an appellant declines a hearing and then the agency requests but is denied a hearing, the appellant cannot complain that he was improperly denied a hearing by relying on the agency's request. <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 510, 512-13 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a hearing must be requested if it is desired, the AJ must examine the materials he receives to divine the appellant's intent. He cannot denigrate the statutory hearing right to a recitation of magic words in an appeal. If an appellant indicates that he would like to present evidence orally, and then fails to respond to a form notice from the Board stating that if he did not previously request a hearing, he may amend his appeal to do so, the appellant did not waive a hearing. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 556, 557, 4 MSPB 73 (1980). If a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant requests a hearing and files a designation of representative, but does not confirm that he will be present at the hearing, his conduct does not constitute intentional and knowing waiver of a hearing, particularly if the AJ becomes aware of the appellant's continued desire for a hearing in sufficient time to hold the hearing and issue an initial decision within the 120 days allowed for initial decisions. <span class="Italic">Webb v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 389, 393, 3 MSPB 469 (1980) ("It is fundamentally abhorrent to our system of jurisprudence to deny a hearing to a litigant where justice and law require that a hearing be held." <span class="Italic">National Broadcasting Co. v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 362 F.2d 953 (D.C. Cir. 1966).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. OPM</span>, 82 MSPR 532, 534 &#x00B6; 6 (1999), unequivocally stated the Board's position that hearings are not to be denied once requested because the appellant fails to respond to a single inquiry from an AJ. In <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span> the AJ learned that the appellant's phone was disconnected and then sent her an order on October 8 directing her to call or fax him by October 15 so that a telephonic hearing could be held. The order noted that a failure to respond would be deemed waiver of the hearing. The appellant asserted that she could not respond in time because of "tragic circumstances," not described in the decision, that prevented her from accessing her mail at her post office box and timely responding to the order. The Board observed that the appellant's multiple submissions demonstrated her interest in the continued process of the appeal. As to the implied waiver of the hearing, the AJ erred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's right to a hearing should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances....&#8197;A single failure to comply with an order is insufficient to show a lack of due diligence, negligence, or bad faith in the appellant's compliance with an administrative judge's orders, so as to justify a drastic sanction such as limiting her to the presentation of oral argument at a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 78 MSPR 615 &#x00B6; 5 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hart v. USDA</span>, 81 MSPR 329, 333 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (1999) (hearing should not have been denied as a sanction when the appellant may have relied upon an agency motion to postpone the proceedings, including a prehearing conference; inadvertent failure to comply with the AJ's order was not an extraordinary circumstance warranting the extreme sanction of a denial of hearing); <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 63 MSPR 338, 346 (1994) ("Although we do not hold that a denial of a hearing should never be imposed as a sanction, <span class="Italic">see generally</span> <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. DHHS</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 482 U.S. 913 (1987), we must emphasize that an appellant's right to a hearing should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Fortson v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 636 (1984) (Table), the waiver assumed an unambiguous notification from the regional office; if that were lacking, then the hearing was not waived by an appellant's inaction. <span class="Italic">Hightower v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 281, 283 (1985). <span class="Italic">Lynn v. Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 1 MSPR 342, 1 MSPB 331 (1980), declared that waiver of a hearing had to be unequivocal. The appellant's submission of evidentiary materials to the AJ did not alone suggest a waiver of a requested hearing. <span class="Italic">Gandolph v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 427, 428 (1983). Bear in mind that these cases were developed prior to the regulation that implies a waiver from failure to request a hearing when the appeal is filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant's response to the AJ on the subject of a hearing is ambiguous and the AJ then sends an order stating that a hearing will not be held, an objection by the appellant to that order should alert the AJ to his error in concluding that the hearing was waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 367, 372 (1992). If the appellant requests a hearing but the AJ does not rule on the request, the failure to issue a ruling is immaterial if the case could not have been heard because the Board lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Perez v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 248, 250 n.3 (1992). If an appellant claims that he submitted a hearing request that was not acted upon by the AJ because it was not received by the AJ, the appellant should provide to the Board a copy of the hearing request with information tending to demonstrate that the request was submitted to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 15, 20 (1997) (dispute over whether the appellant faxed a hearing request to the AJ; the record did not contain evidence of the fax and the appellant did not object to the AJ's order setting a date for a close of the record without a hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the law predating the explicit regulatory waiver of a hearing in the absence of a specific request, an employee who did not respond to the AJ's inquiries as to whether a hearing was requested waived the hearing if the employee appeared to be sophisticated enough to understand that he waived a hearing by failing to respond. <span class="Italic">Bell v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 61, 62 n.* (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Feathers v. OPM</span>, 27 MSPR 485, 487 (1985) (failure to request a hearing was not excused by lack of representation; the appellant did not request the AJ to postpone the hearing until she secured counsel); <span class="Italic">Ensminger v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 297, 299, 4 MSPB 367 (1980) ("[T]he appellant was sent a letter from the Acting Chief Appeals Officer dated June 11, 1979, which notified the appellant of his right to amend his appeal to request a hearing and warned him that his failure to do so would result in his waiving his right to a hearing. He was also urged to review the Board's regulations and was told specifically where the regulations were available for review. By letter dated July 11, 1979, the Acting Chief Appeals Officer again reviewed procedures for requesting a hearing and stated in part "...if you do not respond...I will assume you do not wish to have a hearing."); <span class="Italic">Christian v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 310, 313, 3 MSPB 395 (1980) ("He was informed, in the June 1 letter, that the record would be closed on June 11. He called the field office to request an extension to June 12, once again evidencing an understanding of the processing of the case. The extension was granted. Appellant never mentioned or inquired about a hearing until after the unfavorable decision. Further, his designated representative also failed to preserve the hearing right."). The appeal was then adjudicated on the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walton v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 752, 754 2 MSPB 160 (1980) (no error when the representative did not receive the hearing notice; no hearing was requested). A single notice to an appellant that gave him information on making a hearing request, and informed him that without a request the hearing right would be waived, was sufficient notice to the appellant of the right to a hearing and the consequences of failure to exercise that right. <span class="Italic">Dail v. OPM</span>, 4 MSPR 491, 492, 5 MSPB 26 (1981). The failure to request a hearing after having two chances constituted a waiver. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v.
