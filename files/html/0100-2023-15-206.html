<p class="Body-Text">Speaking rudely to a patient is patient abuse. Because patients at VA facilities are often helpless, confused, dependent on staff, under no circumstances should verbal abuse of patients be tolerated. <span class="Italic">Small v. VA</span>, 26 MSPR 488, 489 (1985) (although others considered the appellant's remark a joke, the patient was angered and agitated); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cosme v. VA</span>, 370 Fed. Appx. 94 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) (removal of VA police officer for disrespectful behavior toward a patient and failure to observe precaution for a patient's safety); <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. VA</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. 990 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (removal of medical technician for intimidating language toward a patient); <span class="Italic">Abaqueta v. United States,</span> 255 F. Supp.2d 1020 (D. Az. 2003) (sustaining removal of a physician for inappropriate conduct toward a patient); <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 2 MSPR 328, 330 (1980) (removal for charges of sexual abuse of quadriplegic and paraplegic patients); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Parker v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 353, 358 &#x00B6; 9, 2015 MSPB 30 (2015) (involving a patient in an ongoing staff disagreement: "boundary violations include actions which compromise the professional and therapeutic patient/staff relationship"). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-017.html#sec7-18">Sexual Misconduct.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although verbal or physical abuse of patients warrants discipline, physical abuse is generally the more serious offense, <span class="Italic">Santiago v. VA</span>, NY-0752-12-0010-I-1 (NP 7/1/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Our decisions recognize a difference between verbal and physical patient abuse; although we condone neither, physical patient abuse is generally a more serious offense based upon the degree of harm to the patient and the intentional nature of the aggressor's physical misconduct. <span class="Italic">Byers v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 655, &#x00B6; 26 (2001); <span class="Italic">Hosler v. Veterans Administration</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 265, 269-70 (1989)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Physical and verbal rough handling of a delicate patient was sufficient cause for removal of an LPN warned that his treatment of other patients was too rough. <span class="Italic">Harris v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 70, 74 (1987) (relying on <span class="Italic">Talbott v. VA</span>, 11 MSPR 201, 203 (1982) (a nursing assistant was removed for patient abuse; medical evidence did not show that the appellant was incapable of inflicting physical abuse)); <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3236) (removal of a supervisory clinical nurse for slapping a patient); <span class="Italic">Hosler v. VA</span>, 42 MSPR 265, 269-70 (1989) (nursing assistant removed for the physical abuse of and speaking rudely to patients); <span class="Italic">Lavezza v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 105, 107 (1985) (nursing assistant discharged for hitting a patient); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 22 MSPR 350, 353 (1984) (removal of a nursing assistant was sustained for kicking a patient); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 440, 441 (1982) (removal on charge of kicking a patient on the side of the face); <span class="Italic">Greubel v. VA</span>, 11 MSPR 508, 510-11 (1982) (evidence, involving the statements of other patients and employees, weighed in favor of a nursing assistant's explanation that efforts to subdue an assaultive patient did not amount to abuse); <span class="Italic">Wade v. VA</span>, 8 MSPR 414, 415 (1981) (removal of a food service worker for pushing a patient who then lost his balance, stumbled across the room, and fell onto his bed); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Abrams v. VA</span>, 306 Fed. Appx. 602 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (removal for inappropriate relationship with a patient).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. VA</span>, 98 MSPR 337, 340 &#x00B6; 8 (2005), reinstated removal, mitigated by an AJ to a suspension, of an LPN who cut a patient's hair and beard against his consent, while the patient was held down by other employees to overcome his resistance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he deciding official appropriately determined that the appellant's misconduct caused undue stress to a patient who relied on her for compassion and professional service, that the appellant's position requires a need for sensitivity and advocacy for the patient, that the appellant's misconduct caused a breach of trust that harms the patients, their families, and the agency, and that the removal penalty is consistent with the agency's table of penalties."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed. Deference was provided to the agency, whose table of penalties permitted anything from a reprimand to removal for a first instance of patient abuse, but whose policy also stated a zero tolerance level for patient abuse, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. VA,</span> 175 Fed. Appx. 335, 338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Court must affirm a Board decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). In determining the appropriateness of a penalty, an agency must weigh the factors outlined in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). When, as here, the Board sustains the agency's charge, the agency's decision may only be reviewed to determine whether the agency properly weighed the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> <span id="Page_2708"></span>factors and whether the penalty was reasonable based on its weighing of factors. <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 253 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor is the "nature and seriousness of the offense." 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. In her <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> Factors report, Ms. Catellier stated that the "alleged offense is very serious. Ms. Taylor's assaultive behavior toward the patient[&#8197;] created an atmosphere the patient perceived as hostile. Ms. Taylor's inappropriate behavior caused undue stress to a patient who relied on her for compassion and professional service." The record does not support a finding that Ms. Catellier erred in determining that this offense was "very serious." Indeed, the restraint of Mr. S, especially after he had repeatedly objected and resisted, strongly supports a finding that the offense was "very serious." Thus, the nature and seriousness of the offense weighs in favor of a strong penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor of particular relevance is the "consistency of the penalty with any applicable agency table of penalties." 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. For a first offense of patient abuse, the table of penalties provides for a penalty ranging from reprimand to removal. Moreover, Memorandum No. 00-55-00, titled "Protection of Patients from Abuse," emphasizes that "<span class="Italic">[t]</span> <span class="Italic">he Department of Veterans Affairs has no tolerance for mistreatment or abuse of patients by its employees</span>" (emphasis in original). Indeed, this Memorandum informs employees that "[i]f patient abuse is proven, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken, including possible dismissal from employment." Ms. Taylor disputes the statement by Ms. Catellier in Ms. Catellier's assessment of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors that Ms. Taylor "fails to acknowledge any wrongdoing." Ms. Taylor argues that consideration of this allegedly erroneous fact in the weighing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors unfairly skewed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis. Yet whether or not Ms. Taylor's statements to the panel showed such a failure, the other factors alone, in particular the seriousness of the offense, supported removal as an appropriate penalty, especially given the zero tolerance policy for patient abuse and the notice to employees of the definition of patient abuse and the possible penalty of removal. Thus, the penalty of removal of Ms. Taylor for patient abuse was consistent with the possible range of penalties for the offense, given the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intent is a factor to consider in evaluating a charge of patient abuse. <span class="Italic">Carson v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 631, 633-34 (1986) (nursing assistant was charged with patient abuse; the AJ properly considered the appellant's intent in mitigation: the appellant used excessive force in moving a delicate patient, but the appellant did not intend to injure the patient); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ware v. VA</span>, 76 MSPR 427, 435 (1997) (patient abuse did not include the negligent handling of a patient, although that was a separate offense warranting adverse action). <span class="Italic">Metz</span> factors [discussed as to threats] may not necessarily be of equal importance in patient abuse cases, but the court left the issue open. <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3283). Abuse may involve teasing a patient, neglecting medical care duties for a patient, or rude comments to a patient. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. VA</span>, 11 MSPR 354, 355 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Townsend v.

An allegation of patient abuse should be substantiated by credible evidence. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 110, 115, 117 (1988), set aside a suspension; the agency's hearsay evidence was outweighed by appellant's credible testimony.

Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 13 MSPR 288, 292 (1982) (setting aside patient abuse charges when the principal witness was not credible).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board carefully examines the facts to determine the circumstances of alleged physical abuse when the appellant provides an explanation, e.g., an attempt to restrain a physically abusive patient. The question then becomes whether the appellant's use of force to restrain the patient was excessive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greubel v. VA</span>, 11 MSPR 508, 510-11 (1982). <span class="Italic">Young v. VA</span>, AT-0752-11-0862-I-1 (NP 7/13/2012), allowed for and credited self-defense in response to a patient abuse charge, reversing the employee's removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from his GS-6 Medical Supply Technician position at the agency's Tampa, Florida hospital effective July 8, 2011, based on the charge of patient abuse. After a hearing, the administrative judge made detailed factual findings, which the agency does not contest on review, including that: 1) a nurse was transporting a large, loud, and profane patient in a wheelchair when she became concerned about his behavior and asked the charge nurse for assistance; 2) the charge nurse directed the appellant to move the patient to another area; 3) as the appellant bent down to move the wheelchair through a closed doorway (thus limiting the appellant's ability to move away from the patient), the patient punched the appellant in the mouth, bloodying the appellant's lip; 4) the patient then prepared to strike the appellant again, but before he could do so the appellant pushed the patient back in the wheelchair with one hand and nearly simultaneously struck him with his other closed hand; 5) the appellant then moved away from the patient; 6) the patient did not require medical attention from the altercation, but the appellant had a headache and received a swollen and bloodied lip that required minor medical attention. Based on the factual findings summarized above, and after considering the agency's patient abuse and violence prevention policies as well as the Board's precedent on self-defense, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to prove that the appellant's conduct constituted patient abuse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that "[i]t is never acceptable for healthcare workers at a [Department of Veterans Affairs] hospital to strike a patient," and the fact that the appellant admitted to striking a patient is sufficient to prove the charge of patient abuse. The agency cites nothing in its petition for review to support such a universal rule, however, and we have found nothing to support such a conclusion. Rather, the circumstances of each case must dictate whether self-defense can be raised as an applicable defense to a charge of patient abuse.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although not specifically cited by the agency on review, we note that, in analyzing the appellant's self-defense claim, the administrative judge considered the hospital's policy on employee abuse of patients and the policy on violence in the workplace and concluded that those policies did not prohibit an employee from acting in self-defense in appropriate circumstances. We discern no error in the administrative judge's analysis, and the agency has not identified one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an effort to support its argument that self-defense is not a valid defense to a charge of patient abuse, the agency cites <span class="Italic">McIntosh v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 280 F. App'x 990 (Fed. Cir. 2008), and <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 175 F. App'x 335 (Fed. Cir. 2006), which, although not involving claims of self-defense, concluded that removal was the appropriate penalty for an act of patient abuse. Both of these decisions are unpublished decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit; thus, even if they did address the central issue in this case, they would not constitute binding precedent. <span class="Italic">Omites v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 13 (2000); <span class="Italic">see McDonnell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 400, 402 &#x0026; n.* (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the administrative judge erroneously relied on the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 402 (2008), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds</span>, 328 F. App'x 646 (Fed. Cir. 2009), and <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 187 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), to support his finding that the appellant acted in self-defense. According to the agency, those cases involved violence in the workplace between two employees and not patient abuse by a healthcare worker. While the agency is correct that <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> and <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> both involved altercations between coworkers, the administrative judge correctly cited them for propositions related to the elements of a claim of self-defense. We discern nothing in <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> or <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> to suggest that self-defense cannot be raised as a valid defense to a charge of patient abuse, and nothing suggests that the elements set forth in those cases are not applicable to the instant case. Based on our review of the record, we also find that the administrative judge correctly applied the elements of a self-defense claim to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also complains on review that the appellant's claim of self-defense was not identified as an issue during the prehearing conference or at the beginning of the hearing and that it was not on prior notice as to the defense. While the agency is correct that the administrative judge did not specifically identify the claim of self-defense during the prehearing conference, the appellant repeatedly raised such a claim before the agency and the administrative judge, and thus we believe that the agency was on notice that self-defense was an issue in this appeal. Furthermore, the agency has not shown what it would have done differently had the administrative judge identified self-defense as an issue in the prehearing <span id="Page_2709"></span>conference, and, thus, the agency has not shown how the administrative judge's actions prejudiced it. <span class="Italic">See Henderson v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 14 (2011) (finding that the agency was not prejudiced by an administrative judge's failure to provide specific notice and an opportunity to develop the record on an issue when the initial decision properly identified the issue and the agency did not show on review what evidence it would have submitted below had it been provided the opportunity to do so). Moreover, the agency had an opportunity to argue its theory about the inapplicability of the claim of self-defense to a charge of patient abuse before the Board on review. Thus, again, any error by the administrative judge did not prejudice the agency. <span class="Italic">See Caracciolo v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 663, &#x00B6; 11 (2007) (failure to provide proper notice in an acknowledgment order or show-cause order can be cured if the initial decision puts a party on proper notice).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Self-defense was considered but not credited as a mitigating factor in a removal based on an alleged altercation with a patient, <span class="Italic">Layton v. VA</span>, SF-0752-13-1060-I-1 (NP 7/7/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support an assertion of self-defense, the appellant must prove, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he used only so much force as was reasonably necessary to free himself from another's unwanted grasp. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 14 (2008), <span class="Italic">reversed on other grounds</span>, 328 F. App'x 646 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Factors to consider in determining whether the level of force was reasonably necessary include the amount of force exerted, the means or instrument used, the manner or method of applying force, and the circumstances under which the force was applied. <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Department of the Navy</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 187, 190 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Moreover, the doctrine of self-defense may not be successfully invoked if the person raising it was not free from fault in bringing on the difficulty, unless that person retreats in good faith, intending to abandon the difficulty that eventually led to the aggression. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hatley v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 585, 591-92 (1982), sustained removal for an instance of patient abuse:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant had 14 years of service with the agency, during which time he received several performance awards, the offense in this case was serious. Appellant's conduct physically injured one patient and frightened other patients. The agency's reputation for providing competent health care was harmed. Furthermore, appellant had not shown that he would not be prone to physically abuse other patients in the future. We also note that the removal did not exceed the penalty listed in the table of penalties set out in the agency's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's supervisors cannot be expected to have confidence in his ability to perform his assigned duties as a psychiatric nursing assistant in view of the seriousness of the offense. A lesser penalty would not adequately deter such conduct in the future by other agency employees. In addition, appellant failed to substantiate his claim that other employees had received lesser penalties for similar offenses and the record does not reveal any inconsistencies of this nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, appellant's conduct must be considered intentional, especially since he failed to provide any reliable medical evidence to establish that his conduct was the result of a medical condition. There is no basis in the record for even inferring that his conduct was other than intentional.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was too severe for a housekeeping aide, whose performance on the job was commendable and whose relationship with patients was good, but who made a remark provoking a patient's complaint that, while too personal, was not threatening or cruel, and was not intended to harm the patient, who suffered no lasting psychological damage or injury. There was no record support for conclusions that removal was needed to deter future conduct by the appellant or others, that there was no potential for rehabilitation, or that retention of the appellant would jeopardize the hospital mission or the well-being of the patient population. A 30-day suspension was imposed. <span class="Italic">Theisen v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 277, 281-82 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Byers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also objects to the administrative judge's findings regarding the charge of disrespectful conduct toward persons outside the agency. This charge concerns the appellant's dealings with personnel at Soledad prison while investigating a complaint (the Dougherty complaint). According to officials at that prison, when the appellant was told that fog could hamper his scheduled interviews with inmates, he replied that he did not care about prison security measures. He is alleged to have stated further, "I am from the Federal Government and you will make sure that the inmates are there at 8:30 <span class="small">A.M.</span> as I requested." He also allegedly referred to vocational teacher Dougherty as "not a real teacher" and characterized a reading test as invalid without seeing it. In addition, the appellant is said to have accused prison officials of "setting up" Dougherty by giving him an invalid reading test, and to have rudely terminated a telephone call by hanging up the receiver. Soledad prison personnel described the appellant's behavior as rude, discourteous, accusatory, arrogant, offensive, and insulting. They also felt that he had prejudged the complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that his remarks to personnel at Soledad prison were privileged under 42 USC 2000e-3(a) because they were made while he was investigating a civil rights complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have stated above, the appellant's conduct is not privileged merely because it concerns a discrimination complaint. After balancing the purpose of 42 USC 2000e-3(a) to protect persons opposing discrimination against Congress' desire not to tie the hands of employers in controlling employees, we find that the appellant went beyond the tolerable limits of conduct....&#8197;We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's statements were lacking in tact and professionalism, and that the appellant displayed unnecessary arrogance....&#8197;We also find that the appellant's behavior was disrespectful as charged by the agency, that it established a hostile atmosphere, and that it led the objects of his rudeness to doubt that the appellant would make an unbiased finding. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant's behavior damaged the agency's interests, was excessive in nature, and therefore is not privileged under 42 USC 2000e-3(a)....</p>
