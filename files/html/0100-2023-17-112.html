<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 614, 616 (2016), advises as to exceptions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A dispute becomes moot when there is no longer a legally cognizable interest in the case.[22] In this respect, although there may have been a justiciable controversy when a case was filed, once that controversy ceases to exist, the issues arising out of that controversy will be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.[23] Accordingly, issues will be dismissed as moot if they have been resolved by interim events.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">ACT Show-Me</span> also noted the requisites of the mootness doctrine, 59 FLRA at 380:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the merits of the Agency's mootness argument, a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome<span class="Italic">. See Soc. Sec. Admin., Boston Region (Region 1), Lowell Dist. Office, Lowell, Mass.,</span> 57 FLRA 264, 268 (2001) (<span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>). The burden of demonstrating mootness is a heavy one<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The party urging mootness meets its burden by demonstrating that: (1) there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur; and (2) interim relief or events have completely or irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>...</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 170 and DCMA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-237.html">71 FLRA 1259</a>, 1260 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring) ("The Authority will find a petition moot where the issues that led to the filing of a petition have been resolved, or where there is no longer a dispute between the parties. Furthermore, the burden of demonstrating that a petition is moot falls on the party urging mootness.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties are responsible for informing FLRA of circumstances that suggest mootness of exceptions to an award. If the parties do not inform the parties of events affecting an assessment of mootness, FLRA is likely to resolve the exceptions on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 58 FLRA 77, 79 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator denies a grievance, the award will ordinarily moot an exception based on an arbitrability argument. <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 776 and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot</span>, 63 FLRA 93, 94 (2009), explained in the context of a grievance, denied by the arbitrator on the merits, that sought an award of back pay under a statute that raised an issue of arbitrability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency does not dispute the Arbitrator's determination on the merits, it contends that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the grievance was arbitrable. The Arbitrator determined that the grievance was arbitrable as it did not require the resolution of a classification matter, and ultimately resolved the dispute in favor of the Agency.

<p class="noindent-1">Under the facts of this case, we need not rule on the Agency's exception. The Arbitrator denied the Union's grievance and the matter was resolved in favor of the Agency. Therefore, the issue regarding whether the matter was arbitrable is no longer legally cognizable. <span class="Italic">See Local 171, </span>61 FLRA at 663. Consequently, we dismiss the Agency's exception as moot.[3] <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (Authority dismissed union's exception as moot where union excepted to award ordering union to pay all arbitration costs and agency contended that it paid one-half of costs and union did not dispute agency's contention); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Justice, INS, Jacksonville, Fla., </span>36 FLRA 928, 932 (1990) (Authority found agency's first exception moot where union in its opposition agreed with agency's interpretation of arbitration award as set forth in that exception).</p>

The arbitrator resolved the suspension dispute in accordance with the earlier agreement. FLRA found moot the issue of the effectiveness of the later agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">Agency exceptions are moot if the union withdraws the grievance that forms the basis for the arbitrator's award.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA, Boston Region and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 57 FLRA 264, 268 (2001), decided that exceptions to an award directing the reassignment of the grievant to a different supervisor were not mooted when that reassignment occurred before issuance of the award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the portion of the award directing reassignment of the grievant to a different supervisor is moot because the Agency reassigned the grievant to a different supervisor prior to the issuance of the Arbitrator's decision. We conclude that this argument is without merit, however.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that a dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome<span class="Italic">.

The party urging mootness meets its burden of demonstrating that neither party has a legally cognizable interest in the final determination of the underlying questions of fact and law, upon satisfaction of two conditions: (1) that 'there is no reasonable expectation'...that the alleged violation will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely [or] irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation. <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 183, <span class="Italic">citing County of Los</span> <span class="Italic">Angeles v.

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union has not established that the Agency no longer has a legally cognizable interest in the disputed requirement of the Award. Rather, a real possibility exists that the supervisor could, in the future, be called upon to supervise the grievant again. The supervisor is still a management official, and the Agency could reassign him to supervise the grievant at any time. According to the Agency, such reassignments are routine. Thus, the record does not establish that there is no reasonable expectation of the situation addressed by this portion of the award recurring. <span class="Italic">See SBA, </span>55 FLRA at 183 (award was not moot which required agency to place grievant in an appropriate position even though the agency had terminated the grievant as she had filed a separate action seeking reinstatement). Accordingly, we will consider the merits of the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">C&#x0026;BP, Laredo Section and AFGE Local 2455</span>, 70 FLRA 921, 922 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring), a grievance became moot when the employee complained of the agency's failure to geographically reassign him under the agency's compassionate transfer program, the arbitrator ordered the agency to place the employee on the transfer list, but before the arbitrator's award (and unknown to the arbitrator), the agency provided the employee reassignment to the desired location following selection of the employee under a vacancy announcement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is moot because the grievant was offered, and accepted, a transfer to the requested duty station. The Union argues that the award is not moot because it will have an impact on future compassionate transfer requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An underlying dispute becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the dispute.[8] When a party argues that a matter is moot, it must demonstrate: (1) that there is no reasonable expectation that the alleged violation will recur; and (2) events have completely or irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation.[9] The Authority will set aside an award if the underlying dispute is moot.[10]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was offered, and accepted, a transfer before the award was issued. Thus, there is no reasonable expectation that the grievant will request another compassionate transfer from Texas to New York. Although the Union argues that the award is not moot because it will define what circumstances constitute a "dire emergency" in the future, this argument is unpersuasive because the Union only challenged the Agency's denial of this grievant's request. Also, as a general matter, arbitration awards are not precedential.[11] Therefore, this argument provides no basis for finding that the underlying dispute is not moot.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, Robins Air Force Base, Ga</span>., 68 FLRA 102, 106 (2014) (arbitration awards are not precedential); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 236</span>, 49 FLRA 13, 16-17 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Se.

<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to place the grievant on the transfer list to the exact duty station in New York where the grievant has already transferred. Therefore, we find that the grievant no longer has a legally cognizable interest in the underlying dispute because he has received the desired transfer. Thus, this transfer has eradicated any effects of the Agency's initial denial.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;The Union argues that the underlying dispute is not moot despite the grievant's transfer.

The agency had not implemented the earlier orders. There were no demonstrable effects from the orders and they could not be subsequently implemented. The revocation having eradicated the effects of the award, the parties had no legally cognizable interest in the dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was not moot that ordered protective measures to avoid harassment of an employee by a supervisor when, despite measures taken to separate the grievant from the supervisor, there remained the possibility that in the future the supervisor could be called on to supervise the grievant. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent">Exceptions to an award involving bargaining obligations were not moot, despite apparently the permissive nature of the obligation at issue (uniform requirements for civilian technicians), when the contract required that the contractual obligation continue in effect following expiration of the contract until negotiations led to some other arrangement, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force Whiteman AFB and AFGE Local 2361</span>, 66 FLRA 357, 361 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitration matter becomes moot when the parties no longer have a cognizable interest in the dispute.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NATCA, </span>63 FLRA at 591-92 (citing <span class="Italic">IAM District Lodge 776</span>, 63 FLRA 93, 94 (2009)).

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the contract provisions upon which the Arbitrator relied concern a permissive subject of bargaining and that it has taken no action to terminate those provisions.&#x2003;Because the parties do not dispute that the provisions of the parties' agreement upon which the Arbitrator based his award remain in effect, the parties are still governed by those provisions. Consequently, the Arbitrator's award, which was tied to the life of the agreement, has not expired. Thus, the parties continue to have a legally cognizable interest in the resolution of this matter. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's exceptions are not moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Long Beach Healthcare Sys., Long Beach, Cal., </span>63 FLRA 332, 334 (2009) (finding that exception was not moot because parties still had a legally cognizable interest in having their dispute resolved).</p>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions may be moot if the grievant disclaims any interest in the relief, or a component of the relief, awarded by the arbitrator, although other portions of the remedy may not be moot, <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach Health Care Sys. and AFGE Local 1203,</span> 63 FLRA 332, 334 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Agency's exceptions are moot because of subsequent actions taken by both the grievant and the Agency. The Authority holds that an arbitration matter becomes moot when the parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the dispute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 171, Council of Prison Locals 33,</span> 61 FLRA 661, 663 (2006) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 171</span>) (Authority dismissed as moot a union exception regarding arbitration fees where agency had paid the disputed fees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency raises exceptions to two portions of the Arbitrator's award. First, the Agency contends that the requirement that the grievant be offered a position at the San Diego-La Jolla Medical Center is contrary to law and the parties' agreement, and is based on a nonfact. However, in its Opposition, the Union states that "[t]his portion of the remedy is waived per [the g]rievant." Consistent with the record, we interpret this "waiver" as the Union's agreement that the Arbitrator's specification of a posting at the San Diego-La Jolla Medical Center is unenforceable. Therefore, neither party has a "legally cognizable interest in the dispute" over whether a position at the San Diego-La Jolla Medical Center is an appropriate remedy. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 131,</span> 61 FLRA at 663; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Justice, INS, Jacksonville, Fla.,</span> 36 FLRA 928, 932 (1990) (the Authority found agency exception moot where the union agreed with the agency's interpretation of the arbitration award as set forth in that exception). Accordingly, we find that the exceptions related to placement of the grievant at the San Diego-La Jolla Medical Center are moot and dismiss them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency argues that the portion of the Arbitrator's award related to the grievant's supervision is contrary to management's rights. The Union asserts that this exception is also moot because the Agency has already assigned the grievant to a different supervisor. Contrary to the Union's assertion, however, in previous cases concerning arbitration awards directing a change of supervision, the Authority has held that the issue of management's rights is not moot merely because the agency made changes to supervision following issuance of the award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Metro. Det. Ctr., Guaynabo, P.R.,</span> 59 FLRA 787, 790 (2004) (<span class="Italic">BOP,</span> <span class="Italic">Guaynabo</span>); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec.

Office, Lowell, Mass.,</span> 57 FLRA 264, 268 (2001) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">Boston</span>). In this regard, the Authority has held that evidence of voluntary changes to a grievant's supervision does "not establish that the [a]gency no longer has a legally cognizable interest in the disputed requirement of the [a]ward" because "a real possibility exists that the supervisor could, in the future, be called upon to supervise the grievant again." <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston,</span> 57 FLRA at 268; <span class="Italic">see also BOP, Guaynabo,</span> 59 FLRA at 790. Likewise, in the present case, there is no evidence that a change in supervision, which was made pursuant to a memorandum with the subject line "Temporary Change in Supervision[,]" is permanent. As this change in supervision may be altered at any time, both parties may still have a legally cognizable interest in the dispute. Accordingly, we find that the portion of the management's rights exception related to supervision is not moot and address it below.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the merits and fee awards are contrary to government-wide regulations, statutes, and Authority precedent. However, when an opposing party agrees to interpret an award so as to avoid a deficiency alleged by an excepting party, the Authority has recognized the agreed-to interpretation of the award as binding, and has dismissed, as moot, any objections to the award based on a different interpretation.[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of VA, VA Long Beach Healthcare Sys., Long Beach, Cal., 63 FLRA 332, 334 (2009) (VA) (where union agreed to "waive" portion of arbitral remedy, Authority found that remedy was unenforceable and dismissed challenge to it as moot); U.S. Food &#x0026; Drug Admin., Detroit Dist., 59 FLRA 679, 683 (2004) (FDA) (where union conceded that agency had authority to cancel telework agreements "due to a change in workload or duties," Authority dismissed argument that award concerning telework effectively precluded agency from assigning duties that required physical office presence); U.S. DOJ, INS, Jacksonville, Fla., 36 FLRA 928, 932 (1990) (INS) (where union conceded that award used terms "official warning" and "reprimand" synonymously, Authority dismissed, as moot, agency's argument that was based on a different interpretation of "official warning").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator incorrectly applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 to resolve the grievance. Although the Arbitrator framed the issues to include whether the Agency violated &#x00A7; 610.121(a)(3), the Arbitrator did not affirmatively find that the Agency either complied with, or violated, that regulation. At one point in the analysis, the Arbitrator discussed a different arbitration case that involved a violation of &#x00A7; 610.121, but the Arbitrator did not relate that discussion to the instant dispute. Further, the Union contends that the Arbitrator "<span class="Italic">did not apply</span>" &#x00A7; 610.121 and, consequently, that the Agency"s arguments about the regulation are "completely irrelevant" to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union has agreed to interpret the award in a manner that does not involve applying &#x00A7; 610.121 to the present dispute, we recognize this agreed-to interpretation of the award as binding.[30] And in accordance with our adopted interpretation of the award, we dismiss, as moot, the Agency"s arguments that the Arbitrator misapplied &#x00A7; 610.121.[31]</p>
