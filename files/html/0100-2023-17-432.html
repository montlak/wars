<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-430"><span class="space">1.</span> Section 7121(f) Award</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a ULP case, the issue of whether FLRA has jurisdiction to review noncompliance with an award involving a &#x00A7; 7121(f) issue, e.g., termination of an employee, when it would not have jurisdiction under 7122 to review the substance of the award, arose in <span class="Italic">Army Adjutant Gen. Publications Ctr. and AFGE Local 2761</span>, 22 FLRA 200, 201-09 (1986). The agency failed to accept complete reversal of a termination and imposed a 60-day suspension against the grievant. FLRA noted that the statutory scheme for termination actions permits review of awards by employees either with the MSPB, under certain circumstances, or in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Agencies may not seek direct review of an arbitration award under 5 USC 7703, but OPM may seek judicial review under &#x00A7; 7703(d) if the Director of OPM is of the opinion that the arbitrator erred in interpreting civil service law and that the interpretation will have a substantial impact on civil service law. Review is then discretionary with the Federal Circuit. In the case before FLRA, OPM did not seek review in court. The award was final and binding. FLRA drew an analogy to its enforcement actions in cases involving awards within its jurisdiction involving no exceptions, when FLRA will not review the underlying merits of the award. FLRA decided that, in cases originally removed from FLRA review jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7121(f), on enforcement through ULP proceedings there would be no conflict with congressional intent or the specific statutory procedures if the awards were enforced without reference to the underlying merits of the dispute. From that essential jurisdictional finding, FLRA had no difficulty concluding that the failure of the agency to honor the arbitration award violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1). FLRA reiterated that it has jurisdiction to order compliance with &#x00A7; 7121(f) arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 3882</span>, 22 FLRA 928, 932 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. FAA and NATCA</span>, 54 FLRA 480, 484 (1998) ("Once an award becomes final and binding, differences in review forums become meaningless, and the Authority enforces compliance with an arbitrator's final award."); <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA 749, 759 (1991) (FLRA may order compliance with a final award that would otherwise only have been reviewable by the Federal Circuit, distinguishing <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 850 F.2d 782, 785-86 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (FLRA cannot enforce award that arbitrator had no jurisdiction to issue)).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's jurisdiction to enforce and review &#x00A7; 7121(f) awards was considered in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 41 FLRA 755, 765-72 (1991). The union obtained reinstatement of an employee through arbitration. OPM then unsuccessfully sought judicial review of the award in the Federal Circuit. After the government failed to persuade the court to set the award aside, the agency-employer, DHHS, refused to abide by the award, and a ULP proceeding ensued to enforce the award. FLRA considered related issues: first, to what extent it had jurisdiction to enforce the award through ULP proceedings; second, to what extent it would review the merits of the award in the enforcement proceedings:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge noted, it is clear that "matters which go to the merits of an award are not litigable in an unfair labor practice proceeding brought to enforce the award, '...matters that go to the merits of the award...may only be raised within the appeals procedures established by Congress[']." Judge's Decision at 9 (quoting <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, 22 FLRA at 206, and <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Washington, D.C., and Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Ray Brook, New York</span>, 22 FLRA 928, 932 (1986), <span class="Italic">enforced mem. sub nom. Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 819 F.2d 1131 (2d Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">FCI, Ray Brook</span>)). The Authority and the courts have held that, under section 7122(b) of the Statute, an agency must take the action required by an arbitrator's award when that award becomes "final and binding." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 35 FLRA 491, 494-95 (1990) (and cases cited in the decision). An award becomes final and binding under section 7122(b) when no timely exceptions are filed to the award under section 7122(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, the court refused to indirectly review the Authority's decision that denied exceptions to an arbitration award. The court refused to permit the agency respondent to relitigate the Authority's decision as part of the unfair labor practice proceeding for refusing to comply with the arbitration award. In reaching this decision, the court noted from the legislative history to the Statute that it was the "intent of the House...to make it clear that the awards of arbitrators, when they become final, are not subject to further review by any other authority or administrative body."...792 F.2d at 29 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 158 (1978) (conference report)). The court ruled that, in view of the language of the Statute and the legislative history, Congress did not intend indirect review of arbitration awards. The court further ruled that such indirect review "runs counter to public policy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court noted that indirect review would result in excessive delay and expense contrary to the public policy underlying arbitration <span id="page_2494"></span>awards that favors quick, definite, and inexpensive resolution of labor disputes. The court in <span class="Italic">United States Marshals Service v. FLRA</span> similarly rejected indirect review of arbitration awards. The court found that such review had "little to commend it in terms of judicial economy" and that "[i]t also fl[ew] in the face of legislative intent." 778 F.2d at 1436. The court held that it would "review the award only to determine whether an unfair labor practice was committed[,]" and the court had "little difficulty in holding that the studied refusal of the employer to abide by an FLRA order enforcing a final arbitration award [wa]s an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1437.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, when the arbitrator's award relates to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute, such as a removal covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the parties to the award are precluded by section 7122(a) of the Statute from filing exceptions to the award with the Authority. <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, 22 FLRA at 203. Review of arbitration awards relating to such matters, like review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board, may be obtained by filing an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. However, pursuant to section 7703, agencies adversely affected or aggrieved by the arbitrator's award in these matters are not entitled to obtain judicial review. Instead, section 7703(d) provides that the Director of OPM may seek to obtain review if the Director determines that the arbitrator erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the arbitrator's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 205. When OPM seeks review, the granting of the petition is at the discretion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Examining this statutory scheme, the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span> that for awards relating to these matters described in section 7121(f), the award becomes final and binding upon completion of the appeal process in accordance with section 7703(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 207; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">FCI, Ray Brook</span>. Moreover, the Authority concluded that there was no indication that the provision of section 7122(b), which states that "[a]n agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award," should not apply to those awards that became final and binding by reference to section 7703. In other words, the Authority held that, once an award became final and binding, differences in review forum became meaningless and that the Authority would enforce compliance with an arbitrator's final award. <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, 22 FLRA at 207.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the arbitrator's award became final and binding in accordance with section 7703(d) when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied OPM's petition for review in <span class="Italic">Horner v. Bigelow</span> on August 31, 1987. In our view, the purposes and policies of the Statute identified and discussed by the Authority and the courts in denying indirect review of the merits of an arbitration award in the unfair labor practice proceeding for refusing to comply with the award are best served in this case by enforcing the mandate of section 7122(b): the Respondent shall take the actions required by the Arbitrator's final award. As directed by the conference report, we will not subject the Arbitrator's final award to further review. Furthermore, in our view, to paraphrase the words of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">United States Marshals Service v. FLRA</span>, the Judge's approach has nothing to commend it in terms of the Statute's strong endorsement of arbitration as the preferred means of resolving labor disputes with dispatch and finality. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Marshals Service v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1420 (9th Cir. 1983). Moreover, nothing cited and relied on by the Judge persuades us otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Judge's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> and the court's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span> enforcing the Authority's decision. We agree with the General Counsel and the Charging Party that <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> is limited to cases involving the lack of jurisdiction by an arbitrator because of exclusions by law from the permissible coverage of a grievance procedure negotiated under the Statute. We recently confirmed just such a narrow application of <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Leavenworth Kansas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 85</span>, 39 FLRA 1162 (1991) (<span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>). In <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>, the agency moved for reconsideration of our decision denying the agency's exceptions, in which the agency contended that the award was deficient because the arbitrator did not have jurisdiction to extend the coverage of the grievances to employees of other departments of the agency. In its motion, the agency argued that the Authority failed to consider the arbitrator's lack of jurisdiction and cited as support for its motion <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span>. We denied the motion for reconsideration and specifically held that <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> was "inapposite to the circumstances in the present case." 39 FLRA at 1167. We advised that <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> "concerned the lack of jurisdiction by an arbitrator...over matters that are covered exclusively by title 38 of the United States Code. There is no such statutory exclusion in the present case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We repeat that advice in this case: there is no such statutory exclusion in the present case. It is undisputed that, in this case, the only question of the Arbitrator's authority or jurisdiction was whether, in this particular case, the parties agreed to submit this particular grievance to this particular arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's refusal to enforce an arbitration award concerning the separation of a probationary, competitive service employee in <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 17 FLRA 21 (1985) (<span class="Italic">OPM</span>), was similarly narrowly confined and also provides no support for the Judge's decision. In <span class="Italic">OPM</span>, the Authority refused to enforce compliance with the award although an earlier decision of the Authority had upheld the arbitrator's jurisdiction to resolve such a grievance. The Authority dismissed the complaint because, during the course of the unfair labor practice proceeding, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had held that such grievances were precluded by governing law and regulation, and the Authority had adopted the conclusions of the court and held that decisions of the Authority, including the Authority's decision upholding the arbitrator's jurisdiction, would no longer be followed. In this case, there are no such circumstances involving Arbitrator Smith's award and the decision of the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Judge placed unwarranted reliance on the use of the terms "<span class="Italic">validly obtained arbitration awards</span>" in <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span>....&#8197;We find such reliance unwarranted because the use of these terms in no manner permits the type of collateral attack and indirect review allowed by the Judge. The term "validly obtained" first appears in the Judge's and the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">United States Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 15 FLRA 151 (1984), <span class="Italic">affirmed sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727 (6th Cir. 1985), and merely reflects the discussion of the Judge. The Judge determined that the award was "validly obtained" despite specifically ruling that the jurisdiction of the arbitrator was not subject to collateral attack. He apparently made the determination because he was "not persuaded that a collateral attack on an arbitrator's decision would never lie." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 170 n.8. However, he found that the attack would not lie in the case before him. He refused to consider any question of jurisdiction because the question of jurisdiction had been raised and litigated by the parties. Accordingly, he found that the judgment was conclusive on them and precluded any collateral attack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 171 (citing <span class="Italic">Stoll v. Gottlieb</span>, 305 U.S. 165 (1938)). Furthermore, as relevant to the facts of this case, the Judge specifically held that an issue concerning the "scope of the arbitration agreement" was not a ground for collateral attack because such an issue was "for the arbitrator" and "dissatisfaction with the resolution of that question could properly be remedied only by filing exceptions[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, in our view, use of the term "validly obtained" to permit collateral attack beyond that which has been specifically confirmed in <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span> is unprecedented, and we refuse for all the reasons for which collateral attack and indirect review of arbitration awards in unfair labor practice proceedings have been denied to extend collateral attack and indirect review beyond <span class="Italic">VA Central Office</span>, as we have viewed that decision in <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With no cases cited to us under section 7703(d) allowing the jurisdiction of an arbitrator or the arbitrability of a grievance to be raised before the Federal Circuit other than in a timely action filed under section 7703, we refuse to hold that the analogous process in the Federal sector is any different from the private sector in that the policies favoring arbitration are identical in both sectors. In particular, we refuse to view the Federal sector differently from the private sector on the ground that the agency employer has no right to judicial review under section 7703. We view this scheme to be a deliberate choice by Congress to further the policy of arbitration as a final and binding means of expeditiously resolving labor disputes. Consequently, we refuse to frustrate that deliberate choice and that policy by permitting the question of the Arbitrator's jurisdiction to be litigated in the unfair labor practice proceeding when the Federal Circuit has rejected OPM's petition for review. Stated succinctly, the proper forum for the challenge to the jurisdiction of Arbitrator Smith was the Federal Circuit. The Agency cannot now attack the Arbitrator's contractual jurisdiction in the unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">An underlying question in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 41 FLRA 755 (1991), was whether FLRA should use a different standard as to enforcement of arbitration awards normally reviewable through exceptions and arbitration awards (involving adverse actions) reviewable only at the discretion of the Federal Circuit on petition by OPM. Commenting on that issue, and the treatment by FLRA of arbitration awards involving adverse actions, the D.C. Circuit, affirming FLRA's decision, stated in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 1409, 1412-14 (D.C. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority found that the decision on Bigelow's grievance became final and enforceable after completion of the 7703(d) Federal Circuit appeals process. Thus, allegations that the arbitrator had exceeded the authority that the parties contracted to give him could no longer be raised. According to the FLRA, this conclusion accorded with the relevant congressional policies of arbitral finality and limited appellate review of removal decisions conducted exclusively by the Federal Circuit. Although <span id="page_2495"></span>the FLRA acknowledged that it had previously determined in <span class="Italic">VA Central</span> <span class="Italic">Office v. AFGE</span>, 27 F.L.R.A. 835 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 850 F.2d 782 (D.C. Cir. 1988) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>"), that claims of statutory impediments to an arbitrator's jurisdiction could be raised to defeat finality in an unfair labor practice proceeding, it concluded that decision did not apply to mere contractual bars to arbitral authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA III</span>, 41 FLRA at 768....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to an arbitration reviewable directly by the FLRA under &#x00A7; 7122(a), &#x00A7; 7122(b) prevents any party from challenging the award in a later unfair labor practice proceeding....&#8197;In such cases, opportunity knocks but once. Failure to comply with an award after it is affirmed on appeal to the FLRA or after time for appeal has run out violates &#x00A7; 7122(b), which mandates compliance with an award, and thus constitutes an unfair labor practice....&#8197;The FLRA's decision in this case extends that bar to the parallel situation of awards in removal cases which, under &#x00A7; 7121(f), can only be appealed by OPM to the Federal Circuit, rather than to the FLRA. Once the Federal Circuit rejects the appeal, the award becomes final and failure to comply constitutes an unfair labor practice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treating, for finality purposes, arbitration awards appealed to the Federal Circuit under &#x00A7; 7121(f) in the same manner as awards appealed to the FLRA under &#x00A7; 7122(a) appears to be eminently reasonable. The truncated procedures for review of 7121(f) awards in removal cases reflect a specific legislative intent to put a special premium on finality in cases where employees have been terminated from their jobs. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 64 (1978) (emphasizing that OPM should seek judicial review only in "exceptional cases"). Clearly, according the same degree of finality to an award that OPM has not convinced the Federal Circuit to review as to an award affirmed by the FLRA under &#x00A7; 7122(a) is a plausible enough interpretation of the legislative scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, SSA attacks the FLRA's accommodation on the ground that &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s mandate of compliance with final decisions was meant to apply only to decisions appealable directly to the Authority under &#x00A7; 7122(a), not to decisions which are only subject to discretionary Federal Circuit review under &#x00A7; 7121(f). The text of &#x00A7; 7122(b) lends no support to that selective interpretation. Although &#x00A7; 7122 is entitled "Exceptions to Arbitral Awards," the crucial sentence in &#x00A7; 7122(b) simply states: "An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award." It certainly does not restrict "final award[s]" to ones appealable under &#x00A7; 7122(a). And there is no explicit statutory guidance as to when matters subject to &#x00A7; 7121(f) review to the Federal Circuit become "final." Because all awards must become final and enforceable at some point, the FLRA's decision to declare that finality for 7121(f) arbitration awards exists at the point when the Federal Circuit denies review is certainly reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SSA argues alternatively that the Authority's interpretation of when the Bigelow award became final is irrelevant because this case is directly controlled by our prior ruling in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>. In that case, this court found that it was not "arbitrary and capricious" for the FLRA to permit an agency to defend against an unfair labor practice claim based on its refusal to honor an arbitration award by arguing that a federal statute (specifically, 38 USC 4110, governing disciplinary actions against Veterans Administration health professionals) precluded the arbitrator's jurisdiction over the original claim. <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 850 F.2d at 783. SSA contends that the FLRA is bound in this case by the reasoning it employed to allow the challenge in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>. Specifically, SSA emphasizes that in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> we cited the fact that similar challenges to an arbitrator's jurisdiction are allowed in private arbitration enforcement proceedings...and the fact that in &#x00A7; 7121(f) appeals the agency itself has no right to seek review in the Federal Circuit, but is dependent on OPM's discretion. SSA points out that both those considerations are present here as well, and strongly militate toward the same enforcement defense permitted in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>. SSA makes too much of these similarities, however. In this case, as in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, this court must affirm the FLRA's decision if it is reasonable; it is not controlling that some of the reasons supporting the prior decision also apply to the instant case. The Authority may plausibly find that another, more important factor in that case, the existence of a statutory bar to the arbitrator's jurisdiction, is not present here to justify an exception to the finality principle; i.e., the parties' arbitration agreement simply does not merit the level of obedience that a statute demands. Put another way, the FLRA has decided to distinguish a case of a challenge to an arbitrator's "jurisdiction" based on another federal statute from one predicated on "arbitrability"--the claim that the arbitrator has exceeded his authority under a collective bargaining or arbitration agreement. We think the Authority may sensibly conclude that the difference between those cases is great enough for the overriding principle of arbitral finality to outweigh the factors cited in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's refusal to permit collateral attack in ULP proceedings on the substance of a matter covered by 5 USC 7121(f) (removal from employment) and resolved by a final arbitration award was reiterated, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2774</span>, 65 FLRA 1023, 1028-29 (2011) (<span class="Italic">recon. den</span>. 66 FLRA 47 (2011)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(e) of the Statute, a party may challenge an adverse action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 (&#x00A7; 7512), such as a removal, under either the appellate procedures of the MSPB or the parties' negotiated grievance procedure (NGP) if such matters have not been excluded from the NGP. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army, Adjutant Gen. Publ'ns Ctr., St. Louis, Mo.</span>, 22 FLRA 200, 203-04 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>). If the action is challenged under the NGP and the matter is submitted to arbitration, then the arbitrator is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1), pertaining to the appellate procedures of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 204.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute (&#x00A7; 7121(f)) states that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703 (&#x00A7; 7703), which deals with judicial review of final MSPB decisions, also applies to arbitration awards pertaining to matters covered under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7303 and 7512. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 204-05. Thus, a party that wishes to appeal such an award may not file exceptions with the Authority. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 203. Further, pursuant to the framework for judicial review set forth in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7703, agencies may not directly obtain judicial review of such awards. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 205. Rather, &#x00A7; 7703(d) provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Director of...[OPM (the Director)] may obtain review of any final order or decision of the [arbitrator] by filing, within [sixty] days after the date the Director received notice of the final order or decision of the [arbitrator], a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit [(the Federal Circuit)] if the Director determines, in his discretion, that the [arbitrator] erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the [arbitrator's] decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. If the Director did not intervene in a matter before the [arbitrator], the Director may not petition for review of [an arbitrator's] decision under this section unless the Director first petitions the [arbitrator] for a reconsideration of [his or her] decision, and such a petition is denied....&#8197;The granting of the petition for judicial review shall be at the discretion of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Director does not file a timely petition for review of the arbitration award, then the award is considered final and binding. <span class="Italic">See Army</span>, 22 FLRA at 207-08. At that point, a party that fails to comply with the award's unambiguous terms constitutes a ULP. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 208. Thus, although the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to an award regarding a &#x00A7; 7121(f) matter, the Authority may review in a ULP proceeding the alleged noncompliance with such awards. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 207. In doing so, as with other awards, the Authority will not allow the respondent to collaterally attack the award. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 206. <span class="Italic">Cf. FAA</span>, 54 FLRA 480, 484 (review of arbitration award finding ULP for failure to comply with previous arbitration award); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Carswell Air Force Base, Tex.</span>, 38 FLRA 99, 107 (1990) (in non-&#x00A7; 7121(f) cases, claim that award is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation should be raised as an exception to award, and if party fails to do so, then it "must comply" with final award). In this connection, the Authority has held that to allow for such a collateral attack would circumvent congressional intent with respect to statutory review procedures and the finality of arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">See Army, </span>22 FLRA at 206.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing whether an agency has failed to comply with a final and binding arbitration award regarding a removal, the Authority previously has relied on the fact that the agency failed to request OPM to seek Federal Circuit review of the award. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, the Authority stated that, following the issuance of an award directing an agency to reinstate a grievant, "[i]f the [a]gency had any concerns about reinstating [the grievant] to [the] duties [of her position]..., the [a]gency could have either raised them before [the] [a]rbitrator...or asked the Director of OPM to seek review of the award in the Federal Circuit in accordance with [&#x00A7;] 7703(d)." 54 FLRA at 485. As "[t]he [a]gency did neither[,]" the Authority found that the "award became final and binding, and [&#x00A7;] 7122(b) of the Statute mandated that the [a]gency comply with the...award." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as stated previously, the Respondent became aware of the need to conduct a PRI for the affected employee shortly before his return date of January 5, 2009. In his December 5, 2008 award, the arbitrator had retained jurisdiction "as to any requests for clarification, interpretation[,] and/or implementation of th[e] [a]ward[,]" and did not limit the period of time of his retention of jurisdiction. Thus, there is no basis for finding that the Respondent could not have raised its concerns about the PRI to the arbitrator when it became aware of the need to conduct a PRI. There also is no dispute that the Respondent could have requested OPM to petition the arbitrator for reconsideration and, if that was unsuccessful, to petition the Federal Circuit for review. However, there is no claim or record evidence that the Respondent took any of these actions. As such, FAA supports a conclusion that the "award became final and binding, and [&#x00A7;] 7122(b) of the Statute mandated that the [Respondent] comply" with it by reinstating the affected employee to agent duties. 54 FLRA at 485. As the Respondent did not comply with the award by reinstating the affected employee to agent duties, we find that the Respondent failed to <span id="page_2496"></span>fully comply with the arbitration award and thereby violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA indirectly suggested that because there was no obligation for VA to bargain over procedures involving termination of Title 38 employees, and because grievances over disciplinary actions taken under a contract provision would be contrary to law, FLRA would not enforce an arbitration award that upset disciplinary action taken against a Title 38 employee. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Fargo and AFGE Local 3884</span>, 20 FLRA 854, 855-56 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Minneapolis v.

This intent directly conflicts with the availability of a separate grievance procedure, and even binding arbitration, at the option of DM &#x0026; S professionals under the Civil Service Reform Act."). The suggestion became more direct in <span class="Italic">VA Central Office and AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 27 FLRA 835 (1987). The grievant was removed for misconduct following the recommendation of a VA Board of Investigation. The union grieved the removal, and the arbitrator reinstated the employee. VA excepted to the award, but FLRA declined to entertain the exception, ruling that &#x00A7; 7121(f) divested it of jurisdiction over the award. Then the VA refused to comply with the award, and, naturally, a ULP complaint was filed to secure compliance. FLRA declined to direct compliance and dismissed the complaint, 27 FLRA at 839-40:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority fully discussed the application of section 7121(f) in <span class="Italic">Adjutant General Publications Center</span>, and particularly addressed the matter of compliance with arbitration awards over which it has no jurisdiction under that section. The Authority concluded that once those awards become final and binding because no exceptions are filed under section 7122(b) or because judicial review is not sought in section 7121(f) matters, those awards are enforceable without regard to the merits....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4119, enacted in 1980, provides that no provision of title 5 which is "inconsistent" with a provision of title 38 "shall be considered to supersede, override or otherwise modify" the title 38 provision unless title 5 specifically so provides. The grievance and award in this case concerned the removal of a nurse in VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery...for alleged misconduct under the procedures of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. It is well established that those procedures are the exclusive procedures available to title 38 employees for handling disputes regarding discipline for alleged professional misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Minneapolis v.

<p class="noindent-1">In light of the above rulings as to the precedence of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 over 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, we find that the Arbitrator's award in this case cannot be enforced. The award ordering the grievant to be reinstated with backpay would negate the final decision of the Administrator of the Veterans Administration to remove the grievant for professional misconduct. For the Authority to find a violation and order the Agency to comply with the award under the unfair labor practice provisions of section 7116(a) of the Statute would be to apply the Statute so as to supersede or override the provisions of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. Such a result is barred by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4119. We conclude that there is no basis under the Statute for enforcing compliance with the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in this case focuses on limits the Authority must observe in applying the unfair labor practice provisions of the Statute.&#x2003;It does not affect in any way our precedent holding that in unfair labor practice proceedings, we will not examine the merits of validly obtained arbitration awards to which timely exceptions are not filed under section 7122(a) or for which judicial review is available but not sought under section 7121(f). Under our case law, we will enforce compliance with those awards in such proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may, however, determine its own jurisdiction, and it may review through ULP proceedings the jurisdiction of an arbitrator to consider a Title 38 disciplinary case (and, by implication, any other case involving a direct challenge to the statutory jurisdiction of an arbitrator). <span class="Italic">AFGE v.
