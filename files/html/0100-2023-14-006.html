<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-7"><span class="space">A.</span> SHIFTS, TOURS, HOURS OF DUTY</h3>
<p class="noindent">An employee's hours of work or tour of duty are a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Houston Dist. And AFGE Local 3332</span>, 50 FLRA 140, 144 (1995). An agency has the right not to assign or create particular duties, and to change the duties that have been assigned as a matter of practice over a period of <span id="page_613"></span>years. Management has a right to select employees to perform those duties and to determine the hours to be spent at a particular location. A proposal may not limit the length of time that work normally will be performed. <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 26 FLRA 92, 95 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters and 4392d Aerospace Support Group</span>, 9 FLRA 700 (1982)). Even indirect interference may be proscribed. A proposal that the minimum number of instructional days be 175 days, with additional compensation for teaching beyond that period, was nonnegotiable because the proposal interfered with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 485, 496 (1987). Although the union may not negotiate for specific restrictions concerning the hours of work, it can negotiate for a procedure that management will consider employees' views concerning the scheduling of work during the course of a school day. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 485, 498-99, 511-12 (1987). If the length of the working day is set through a statutory formula, a union proposal that seeks to increase basic compensation for a modification in the length of the working day is inconsistent with the law. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 628, 655-56 (1987). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-104.html#sec6-105">Rotation of Jobs and Assignments</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals that respond to management-initiated shift changes follow a traditional analysis of the impact of the proposal on management rights and the ability of the proposals to qualify as appropriate arrangements to ameliorate the effects on unit employees of the effect of the exercise of the management right to assign work and direct employees. Typical is <span class="Italic">IAFF and Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station Earle</span>, 59 FLRA 832, 832-34 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-2">That the 3 Fire Inspectors be placed on a fixed schedule of six (6) twenty-four (24) hour shifts in each pay period.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The first would work Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday at the Main Side Area. The second would work Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday at the Water Front Area.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The third would work Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, at the Main Side Area, and would be available to fill in at the Waterfront Area as required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal was made in response to the Agency's decision to reduce three fire inspectors' scheduled work hours from alternating 24-hour days (144 hours per pay period) to a fixed schedule, Monday-Friday (with eight 9-hour days and two 24-hour days equaling 120 hours per pay period). The parties agree that the proposal would establish the three fire inspectors' schedules, and would permit the Agency to rotate inspectors from one station to another and to determine which individual inspectors would be assigned which shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The proposal affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine when work assignments will be performed. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Mgmt. and Specialty Training Ctr., Aurora, Colo.</span>, 56 FLRA 943, 944 (2000). Because the determination of employees' daily work schedules--employees' daily starting and quitting times--constitutes a determination of the length of the workday and when during the day assigned work will be performed, it constitutes an exercise of management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).<span class="Italic"> See Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees, Branch 11</span>, 57 FLRA 424, 426 (2001). Similarly, because the determination of employees' basic workweeks constitutes a determination of when during the week assigned work will be performed, the decision as to when employees will begin and end the workweek, for example, Monday through Friday, also constitutes an exercise of management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3157</span>, 44 FLRA 1570, 1579 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that <span class="Italic">VA, Wash., D.C.</span> supports a conclusion that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to assign work. In particular, the Union asserts that the reason for reducing the employees' work hours in the instant case is different from the reason in <span class="Italic">VA, Wash., D.C.</span> However, an agency's determination to reduce work hours, regardless of the reason, involves its right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See VA, Wash., D.C.</span> at 965 [<span class="Italic">VA Wash., D.C</span>. 30 FLRA 961 (1988)]. Therefore, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Va, Wash., D.C.</span> is misplaced. There, as here, the decision to reduce work hours constitutes the exercise of the right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the proposal determines the fire inspectors' schedule regarding both the hours of each work shift and the days of the work schedule, we find that it affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the proposal removes the "adverse impact" on the fire inspectors of a reduction in salary and retirement benefits due to the reduced hours of the Agency's proposed work schedule. We construe the Union's assertion as an argument that the proposal is intended as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v.</span> FLRA, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31. The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l</span> <span class="Italic">Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617-18 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991)). If the proposal is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union alleges, the proposal would benefit the fire inspectors by allowing them to retain their current salary and retirement benefits. However, the proposal also places significant burdens on the Agency. Specifically, the Agency would be required to assign fire inspectors to work at times that the Agency has determined they are not required and to pay each fire inspector twenty-four hours of overtime that the Agency has determined are unnecessary. The Agency would also be prohibited from determining the length of the fire inspectors' workday and when during the day and week assigned work will be performed. In addition, the proposal does not provide any circumstances under which the Agency would be permitted to change the work schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, the burdens on management's right to assign work are not outweighed by the benefits afforded the fire inspectors under the proposal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>,<span class="Italic"> Prof'l Airways Sys. Specialists</span>, 59 FLRA 485, 487-88 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (proposal's restriction of agency's ability to deny an employee's request to take work home outweighs its benefit of essentially permitting employees to determine when work would be performed on an overtime basis); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3694</span>, 58 FLRA 148, 150 (2002); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3807</span>, 54 FLRA 642, 649 (1998) (proposal's requirements of agency to maintain a pilot position, pay an additional pilot, and alter its reorganization plan outweigh its benefit of retaining a single employee's current position). Consequently, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to assign work and, therefore, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1988, many FLRA decisions defined negotiable and nonnegotiable changes in tours of duty, shifts, workdays, and workweeks. Those decisions involved interpretation of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), providing that an agency may elect, but is not required, to negotiate terms concerning a tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 541-44 (1988), helped to clarify, in the context of a ULP proceeding, the scope of negotiations over changes in schedules that arguably amounted to changes in tours of duty. Disputed was whether management was obliged to bargain over its decision to change the hours of an employee who had worked from 3:00-11:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.,</span> to 7:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span>-3:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> The employee operated a battery shop. The change in hours was made, according to management, to facilitate operations of the shop and to enhance available safety protections for the employee. Bargaining was proper for procedures and arrangements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...A "tour of duty" is the "hours of a day (a daily tour of duty) and the days of an administrative workweek (a weekly tour of duty) that constitute an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.102(h). Therefore, an employee's daily tour of duty is his or her hours of work, and any change in the employee's work hours is a change in his or her tour of duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agencies are required to schedule employees' tours of duty not less than 7 days in advance, except where it is determined that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) and (b).... Accordingly, employees must have at least 7 days' advance notice of a change in work schedules unless the change is made for a reason stated in the law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a matter concerning changes in employees' hours of work is within the scope of section 7106(b)(1), the Authority previously has made distinctions between: (1) changes in employees' hours of work which were integrally related to and consequently determinative of the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any <span id="page_614"></span>organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty (<span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1461 and Department of the Navy, U.S. Naval Observatory</span>, 16 FLRA 995 (1984); <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service, Region V, New Orleans, Louisiana</span>, 9 FLRA 116, 117 (1982)); and (2) changes which permit "a modicum of flexibility within the range of starting and quitting times for [an] existing tour of duty" <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 66 and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center</span>, 1 FLRA 927, 930 (1979); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Service, Region V</span>, 9 FLRA at 118-19. As to the former category of cases, the changes in employees' hours of work were found to be outside the duty to bargain; as to the latter category, the changes in hours were found to be within the duty to bargain. It has been noted that these distinctions are subtle ones. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Leavenworth, Kansas</span>, 32 FLRA 832, Judge's Decision at 842 (1988); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 732 F.2d 703 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents an opportunity to clarify the bargaining obligations with respect to changes in employees' hours of work. On our review of this area, we find that the distinctions previously used are not supported by the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, an employee's daily tour of duty consists of the hours that the employee works; that is, from the time when the employee starts work until he or she ends work. A decision as to what will constitute an employee's tour of duty is a decision by management as to when and where an employee's services can best be used. When an agency changes an employee's hours, that change, under applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, results in a new tour of duty for the employee. The degree of the change--whether it is a 1-hour change or an 8-hour change--does not alter the fact that the change results in a new tour of duty for the employee. A change in employees' starting and quitting times is a change in their tours of duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Changes in employees' tours of duty affect the "numbers, types, and grades of employees...assigned to...[a] tour of duty" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. For example, when an agency changes 10 employees' tours of duty by moving the employees from a day shift to a night shift, that change affects the numbers of employees assigned to both tours of duty--it decreases by 10 the number of employees assigned to the day tour of duty and increases by 10 the number of employees assigned to the night tour of duty. Therefore, an agency's decision to make these types of changes is negotiable only at its election under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. To the extent that previous decisions of the Authority are to the contrary they will no longer be followed.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] In some instances, bargaining over flexible work schedules has been specifically authorized by statute.... Those instances are not affected by our decision in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed above, agencies must generally give appropriate notice to employees of changes in their tours of duty. Further, the fact that an agency's decision to change employees' tours of duty is negotiable only at the agency's election should not be viewed as encouraging agencies not to bargain over these changes. Moreover, even where an agency exercises its right...not to bargain over the change itself, an agency has an obligation to bargain over the matters set forth in section 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute: procedures to be observed by management in exercising its authority and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, Porter was the only employee in the Battery Shop.... The Respondent decided to change the hours of the Battery Shop from 3:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 11:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 7:00 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 3:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> The change was made to improve the availability of batteries during peak usage hours, thereby better serving other operations at the facility, and to enhance Porter's safety by increasing the likelihood that other employees would be available to assist him in the event of an accident.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The change in Porter's hours was a change in his tour of duty.... The change, therefore, was negotiable only at the election of the Respondent....</p>
<p class="noindent">A government-wide regulation, 5 CFR 610.121(a) (2022), restricts procedural and arrangements bargaining concerning changes in tours of duty:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">610.121 <span class="Italic">Establishment of work schedules</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Except when the head of an agency determines that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased, he or she shall provide that--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Assignments to tours of duty are scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek over periods of not less than 1 week;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The basic 40-hour workweek is scheduled on 5 days, Monday through Friday when possible, and the 2 days outside the basic workweek are consecutive;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The working hours in each day in the basic workweek are the same;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;The basic nonovertime workday may not exceed 8 hours;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;The occurrence of holidays may not affect the designation of the basic workweek; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(6)&#x2003;Breaks in working hours of more than 1 hour may not be scheduled in a basic workday.</p>
<p class="noindent">Constraints on management's ability to establish shift hours will be nonnegotiable if they vary from the latitude allowed to management under 5 CFR 610.121(a), <span class="Italic">AFGE and DOD, DLA, DCC New Cumberland</span>, 58 FLRA 331, 332 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Statute, parties cannot bargain over matters that are inconsistent with a Government-wide regulation. The Authority has previously found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) is a Government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1815, 53 </span>FLRA 606, 619 (1997). That regulation explicitly permits an agency to change employees' work schedules without limitation "when the head of an agency determines that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal, among other things, would require the parties to survey the employees' wishes and negotiate any changes in the workweek or tour of duty before such changes can be made. As construed, the proposal would permit the Agency to unilaterally change work schedules in emergencies or extraordinary situations, but those situations are not the same as described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). Like the proposal in <span class="Italic">FOP, </span>this proposal would limit the Agency's ability to unilaterally change work schedules pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">FOP, </span>57 FLRA at 378 (proposal that required agency to notify and negotiate with union concerning shift changes before such changes could be made found inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.12 1 (a)).[*] As the proposal would preclude the Agency from unilaterally changing work schedules in the situations described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a), the proposal is inconsistent with the regulation and is outside the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] In <span class="Italic">FOP, </span>the union argued that the proposal was not intended to address emergency situations, and that the union was willing to agree to a clause which would give the agency the necessary authority to take all reasonable and immediate actions to address such emergency situations. The Authority found that the proposal did not allow the agency to unilaterally change work schedules in emergency situations. The Authority also found that although the union stated that it did not intend the proposal to address emergencies, emergencies are not the same situations described under the regulatory standards, and the proposal was inconsistent with the regulatory standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Accordingly, irrespective of whether the proposals in <span class="Italic">FOP </span>and in this case allow the agency to unilaterally change work schedules in emergencies, the "emergency" exception is narrower than the regulatory standards, thereby rendering both proposals inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IAM and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot</span>, 59 FLRA 830, 831-32 (2004), precluded negotiation of a provision (Proposal 2) to prevent a shift change. The proposal lacked the flexibility required by the government-wide regulation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Proposal 2 is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Statute, a proposal that is inconsistent with a Government-wide regulation is outside the duty to bargain. The Authority has previously found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) is a Government-wide regulation. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 619 (1997). That regulation explicitly permits an agency to change employees' work schedules without limitation "when the head of an agency determines that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) (&#x00A7; 610.121(a)). The Authority has held that a proposal that does not allow the agency to change employees' work schedules without limitation pursuant to the situations set forth in &#x00A7; 610.121(a) is contrary to that regulation. S<span class="Italic">ee Haw. Fed. Employees Metal Trades Council</span>, 57 FLRA 450, 452 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 would require the Agency to schedule, without exception, the third shift basic workweek for five consecutive eight-hour work days, Sunday-Thursday. Thus, the proposal does not allow the Agency to change employees' work schedules when it determines that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out agency functions or that its costs would be substantially increased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union did not respond to the Agency's contention that the proposal does not allow the Agency to act unilaterally in either situation set forth in &#x00A7; 610.121(a) and, therefore, has not alleged that the Agency has such discretion. In addition, the two decisions relied on by the Union with regard to Proposal 2 are distinguishable from the instant case. In <span class="Italic">Phila. Naval Shipyard</span>, 39 FLRA at 604, the union grieved the agency's unilateral modification of a work schedule that had been established by contract, and the Authority upheld the arbitrator's finding that the agency had not established substantially increased costs or that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions, which would have entitled it to <span id="page_615"></span>make unilateral changes to the work schedule pursuant to &#x00A7; 610.121(a). Here, the Union is seeking to negotiate contract language that does not authorize exceptions based on &#x00A7; 610.121(a) exceptions. In <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics</span>, 32 FLRA at 279, the Authority upheld a judge's finding that the agency was required to bargain over a change in the starting and quitting times of the disputed shift. However, there were no proposals at issue, either containing or not containing the exceptions set forth in &#x00A7; 610.121(a) and, consequently, no discussion in <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics</span> of whether particular proposals were negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Phila. Naval Shipyard and Ogden Air Logistics </span>is misplaced. As such, based on the record as a whole, we find that Proposal 2 is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) and, thus, outside the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A different result was reached in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3157 and USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv.</span>, 44 FLRA 1570, 1590-92 (1992), declaring negotiable Proposal 3 (setting hours of established eight- and 12-hour shifts) with a proviso that the times were subject to change by management, should the workload require it and in abnormal, unusual, or unforeseen circumstances. After determining that the proposal interfered with the right to assign work, the proposal was analyzed as to establishment of a tour of duty and arrangements bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute provides that an agency may elect, but is not required, to negotiate "on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty[.]" Proposal 3 prescribes the starting and quitting times for five different tours of duty. The proposal does not, however, prescribe the numbers, the types, or the grade levels of the employees to be assigned to any of those tours of duty. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that the proposal would affect management's determination of the numbers, types, or grades of employees assigned to those tours of duty. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Weather Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 400 (Authority determined that the union's proposed starting and quitting times would create an overlap between shifts that would, in turn, affect the numbers of employees on duty at that time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposal would not determine, or otherwise affect management's determination of, the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to the prescribed tours of duty, we find that, in this respect, the proposal does not directly interfere with management's right under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. We also find that the proposal is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 542 (1988).... In that case, the Authority concluded that management's decision to eliminate the shift of an employee and to assign that employee to a different shift constituted an exercise of management's right, under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, to determine the numbers of employees assigned to a tour of duty because it increased the numbers of employees on the shift to which the employee was reassigned. As noted above, Proposal 3 prescribes the tours of duty for employees. The proposal would not result in the addition of employees to, or the subtraction of employees from, any other shifts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the proposal is an appropriate arrangement, we note that the proposal would require management normally to assign work to employees during the hours prescribed by the specified tours of duty and normally to assign work outside those hours only on an overtime basis. The proposal does not preclude management from requiring employees to report to work before the start, or to stay after the close, of the tours of duty prescribed by the proposal. Moreover, by its terms, the proposal permits management to change the prescribed tours of duty for reasons of workload and in abnormal, unusual or unforeseen circumstances. Consequently, while the proposal would limit management's ability in normal circumstances to assign work, the proposal would not prevent management from assigning employees to report early or stay late in order to meet the needs of the grain exporting industry or from changing employees' tours of duty for reasons of workload or in abnormal, unusual or unforeseen circumstances in order to provides services to that industry. The burden imposed on management by the proposal, therefore, is the requirement that management normally assign work during the specified hours and the requirement that management assign work before and after those hours only on an overtime basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 3 benefits employees by affording them certainty and predictability resulting from established starting and quitting times, so that they can, for example, more easily arrange transportation to and from work. We find that the benefits to employees of established starting and quitting times that are afforded by Proposal 3 outweigh the burden imposed by the proposal on management's right to assign work. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 3 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 3 constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 542-43 (1988), the Authority stated that, generally, a change in employees' starting and quitting times is a change in their tours of duty within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute and an agency may decline to bargain on the decision to make the change. However, the Authority noted that some instances, including bargaining over flexible work schedules which are authorized by statute, are not affected by that decision....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternate work schedules are negotiated under the Federal Employees Flexible and Compressed Work Schedules Act.&#x2003;The Work Schedules Act provides that an exclusive representative can negotiate with an agency for the establishment of flexible and compressed work schedules for bargaining unit employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6130(a)(1). Alternate work schedules for bargaining unit employees are fully negotiable within the limits set by the Work Schedules Act. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1934 and Department of the Air Force, 3415 ABG, Lowry AFB</span>, 23 FLRA 872 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Lowry AFB</span>). In that case, the Authority held that an alleged conflict between an alternate work schedule and the Statute does not create a negotiability dispute which the Authority will consider under section 7117 of the Statute. However, proposals that are alleged to be inconsistent with the Work Schedules Act itself or with other laws superseding the 1982 Act are subject to the negotiability appeal procedures of section 7117 of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, matters which pertain to the institution, implementation, administration and termination of alternate work schedules are negotiable. In the case before us, the Respondent sought to make changes in the administration of the flexitime for employees in the Management and Systems Branch.

The burdens on the agency were too substantial to permit the proposal to pass muster as a negotiable arrangement.
