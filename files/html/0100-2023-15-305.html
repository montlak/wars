<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-308"><span class="space">g.</span> Demotion or Reassignment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">One factor suggesting demotion of a supervisor is his contribution toward poor employee morale. <span class="Italic">Ooms v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 15 MSPR 389, 932-93 (1983) (crediting a manager's testimony that he did not encourage the appellant's subordinates to bypass her; evidence did not show how the appellant's performance was compromised through bypassing); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ramseur v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 104, 107 (1983) (demotion from foreman to journeyman when the employee allowed a work crew to remain idle for a day; a past disciplinary record existed). Demotion was appropriate for a senior level auditor with a long record of poor performance. The employee was counseled and retrained. There was a total lack of confidence in his ability to perform at a senior level. <span class="Italic">Krauthamer v. USDA</span>, 11 MSPR 47, 51-52 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Parkes v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR <span id="Page_2844"></span>73, 76 (1982) (demotion of a safety manager to safety officer was based on a failure to perform duties in a conscientious and effective manner); <span class="Italic">Coughlan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 14 MSPR 47, 53 (1982) (demotion of a planner-estimator for inefficiency: "[L]ack of attention and failure to stay on the job, to take it seriously, and to try to work to the best of one's abilities are factors which do not bode well for performance in a position of importance and responsibility."); <span class="Italic">Green v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 13 MSPR 172, 174 (1982) (demotion of a supervisory EEO specialist for failure to perform and direct his duties); <span class="Italic">Epperson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 11 MSPR 569, 574 (1982) (demotion from a GS-13 Internal Revenue Agent, International Specialist, to a GS-12 Internal Revenue Agent, for failing to perform adequate work in a complex area of responsibility); <span class="Italic">Kuhn v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 656, 657 (1981) (demotion of a general engineer for the failure to independently and timely address operational problems); <span class="Italic">Rasmussen v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 245, 249, 7 MSPB 149 (1981) (demotion to a nonsupervisory position rather than removal for mismanagement or negligence of a postmaster; there was a long record of good service and no criminal or fraudulent conduct).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Demotion was appropriate for poor performance after management believed that a suspension would not correct the performance problem. <span class="Italic">Sokolove v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 22 MSPR 413, 415 (1984) ("In determining the penalty to impose in an adverse action taken under 5 USC Chapter 75 for deficient performance, the most important factor is not the employee's disciplinary record, the employee's work history, or the adequacy of other sanctions, but the effect of appellant's deficient performance."). <span class="Italic">Sokolove</span> was reversed by the Federal Circuit. The court concluded that consideration of relevant mitigating factors in adverse actions is not restricted to misconduct cases but is also equally applicable to performance cases under Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Sokolove v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 776 F.2d 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1985). On remand, the Board substituted a 30-day suspension for the demotion. <span class="Italic">Sokolove v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 30 MSPR 180, 181-82 (1986). Demotion was proper for a manager who failed to perform various cost studies used by the agency to determine the cost-effectiveness of its equipment and facilities; the studies were an ongoing and routine function of the organization. <span class="Italic">Shustyk v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 611, 619 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Parker v. USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 510, 2009 MSPB 117 (2009) (demotion of supervisor of customer services for unsatisfactory performance and failure to follow instructions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A postmaster who failed to exercise proper financial management of his office was demoted. <span class="Italic">Cavanaugh v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 670, 674 (1987) (negligence resulted in the underreporting of loss due to theft exceeding $6,300; demotion provided a better opportunity for supervision and correction of the errors than suspension). Demotion was warranted for an FBI Special Agent whose performance at the GS-12 level was unsatisfactory. Although there was no distinction in the level of complexity between GS-12 and GS-11 work, demotion was permitted despite the AJ's belief that the demotion served no remedial purpose. Allowing the appellant to work at a lower grade would permit him another chance to improve his work without the adverse impact of a suspension based on his ability to keep current with his work. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. DOJ</span>, 14 MSPR 188, 189-90 (1982). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Van Gilder v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 337, 340-41 (1982) ("[D]espite his nearly 30 years of satisfactory service prior to the action involved in this case, appellant failed to exert sufficient effort to learn what was necessary in order to perform his new duties in a satisfactory manner. Since the agency could reasonably have expected that appellant's attitude would not change were he to be demoted to another position, we find that its application of the penalty of removal was reasonable and did promote the efficiency of the service."); <span class="Italic">Kalkowski v. DHHS</span>, 16 MSPR 10, 11 (1983) (removal rather than the demotion of a clerk-typist: "[A]ppellant's non-performance of her assigned duties indicated that reassignment to lateral or lower-graded position would probably not result in satisfactory performance[.]").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the penalty administered for poor supervisory performance is a demotion, there remains the question of how severe the demotion should be. <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 487, 491 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998), favored demotion to the highest nonsupervisory level based on the employee's excellent past record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, did not address the factors favoring mitigation, including the appellant's lengthy 17 years of service, 8 1/2 of which he served as a manager, the fact that the deciding official believed that the appellant was hard working, dedicated, and honest and had tried to improve his performance, and the fact that the charge was based on performance-related misconduct that did not involve personal gain or malice. We find that these mitigating factors outweigh the severity of the penalty imposed, i.e., a demotion from an EAS-16 Supervisor, Distribution Operations position to a PS-5 Part-time Flexible Clerk position. While the appellant may be unsuitable to perform in a supervisory position, the record does not establish that he is unsuitable to perform in a nonsupervisory position at a higher grade level than a PS-5 Part-time Flexible Clerk. <span class="Italic">See Dangerfield v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 678, 686-687 (1998); <span class="Italic">Botto v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 471, 477 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the appropriate penalty within tolerable limits of reasonableness is a demotion to the highest-graded nonsupervisory position in the appellant's employing facility area. In compliance, the agency shall apply the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Stabile v.</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Commissary</span> <span class="Italic">Agency,</span> 76 MSPR 658, 662-65 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 25 (1997). Thus, to show that it placed the appellant in the proper position, the agency must demonstrate that it evaluated all available vacancies for which the appellant was qualified, or could have become qualified without undue interruption to the agency's mission, during a period beginning with the date of this Decision, and extending through the date of the appellant's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See Dangerfield,</span> 77 MSPR at 686-687.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to Chapter 16, "Demotion," concerning how agencies are to implement a demotion order as mitigation; refer to Chapter 7, "Ineffectiveness as Supervisor; Demotion."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relatively minor performance deficiencies do not warrant demotion. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Coast Guard</span>, 10 MSPR 573, 579 (1982). Demotion may be inappropriate as mitigation in a performance-related misconduct case if demotion would require greater supervision of the employee and a reduction of his workload. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1090). Removal will not be mitigated if nonperformance of duties showed that demotion would probably not result in satisfactory performance. <span class="Italic">Hershfield v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 444, 446, 5 MSPB 450 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walden v. OPM</span>, 14 MSPR 378, 381 n.4 (1983) (demotion rather than removal of a management analyst was inappropriate when the appellant was incapable of performing at his regular grade, he was repeatedly counseled, he stated that he would not accept demotion, and his supervisors concluded he was incapable of performing as a management analyst at any level); <span class="Italic">Meeks v. GSA</span>, 10 MSPR 191, 193-94 (1982) (appellant's continuing emotional and physical difficulties, and the agency's attempts to accommodate those problems through extensions of her performance evaluation periods, did not favor demotion when the agency needed a satisfactory employee).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency can demonstrate that removal is required when it offered an employee means to succeed in a position and when those efforts were unsatisfactory, <span class="Italic">Springer v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 143, 145 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, appellant failed the scheme for a clerk position, a performance criterion. At the time of his removal, appellant had fifteen years experience with the agency and had performed satisfactorily in a mechanics position until 1976 when the position was abolished due to an agency reorganization. Appellant was then placed in a clerk position, but he failed the scheme. After filing a grievance on this scheme failure, appellant was offered a position as cleaner, but he refused this position. He was again placed in the clerk position and once more failed the scheme. The agency then sought appellant's removal. In his appeal to the Board from this action, appellant maintained that he should have been placed in a mechanics position for which he was purportedly qualified. The agency, on the other hand, has contended that appellant is not physically qualified for a mechanics position. Appellant did not rebut this allegation, but he introduced a letter from the agency which stated that he had passed the mechanics aptitude test and was eligible for promotion. However, this letter did not address appellant's physical qualifications, only his mental abilities for a mechanics position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the long history in this case, appellant's failure to qualify physically for a mechanics position and the agency's efforts to place appellant in other positions, we find that removal was reasonable under the circumstances in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal rather than demotion or suspension may be appropriate if the appellant is not only negligent but actively ignores misconduct of others, particularly if failure to correct misconduct could have a serious impact on the agency's mission, <span class="Italic">Thorne v. TVA</span>, 18 MSPR 514, 516 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the presiding official noted, the appellant failed in his supervisory responsibility not simply by being unaware of misconduct by his subordinates but by ignoring evidence of misconduct which he admittedly found suspicious. Any failure by a supervisor to enforce the agency's rules may be a serious offense. However, in this case it was particularly serious because of the nature of the activity in which his subordinates were engaged. The steamfitter superintendent, Mr. Porch, testified that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had previously closed TVA's Sequoyah Nuclear Plant construction project for several months because of failure to regulate weld filler material adequately and had warned that the Bellefonte project, on which appellant worked, might also be closed unless it improved its control procedures over the material. Thus, appellant's inaction not only bore a direct relationship to his own performance and efficiency but also jeopardized the entire construction project.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment as mitigation in a Chapter 75 performance-based case is moot if the agency has no other positions that could be filled through reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meehan v. USDA</span>, 9 MSPR 280, 283 (1981). If the appellant's performance is substandard, the agency has no obligation to reassign the appellant to a vacancy rather than to demote him. <span class="Italic">Smyth v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 122, 125 (1982).</p>
