<p class="Body-Text">Alternative annuities were suspended, and then precluded after 1990, as described by <span class="Italic">Haywood v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 603, 607, 606-11 (1994), with the exception of a continuing option for an alternative annuity when its denial "would be against equity and good conscience, due to a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition affecting such individual":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to December 1, 1990, retiring employees could elect an "alternative annuity" consisting of a "lump-sum credit" plus an appropriately reduced lifetime annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.2204-.2205. "Lump-sum credit" is defined as "the unrefunded amount" consisting of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;retirement deductions made from the basic pay of an employee or Member;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;amounts deposited by an employee or Member covering <span id="Page_4333"></span>earlier service, including any amounts deposited under section 8334(j) of this title; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C&#x2003;interest on the deductions and deposits at 4 percent a year to December 31, 1947, and 3 percent a year thereafter compounded annually to December 31, 1956, or, in the case of an employee or Member separated or transferred to a position in which he does not continue subject to this subchapter before he has completed 5 years of civilian service, to the date of the separation or transfer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">but does not include interest--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;if the service covered thereby aggregates 1 year or less; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;for the fractional part of a month in the total service[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(8); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990, Congress suspended alternative annuities for annuities commencing after December 2, 1990, and before October 1, 1995, but provided several exceptions to this suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2) (amended by OBRA of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, &#x00A7; 11002(a), (d), 107 Stat. 409, which changed this temporary suspension to a permanent ban); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(h). The exception involved in this appeal was specified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(B) (1993) (amended by OBRA of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, &#x00A7; 11002(a), (d), 107 Stat. 409), and, provided that an alternative annuity shall be allowed if disallowing such an annuity <span class="Italic">"would be against equity and good conscience, due to a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition affecting such individual."</span> [2] (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Effective October 1, 1994, this is the sole exception for the now-permanent ban on alternative annuities. <span class="Italic">See</span> OBRA of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, &#x00A7; 11002(a), (d), 107 Stat. 409.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to a specific statutory grant of authority, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(a), OPM has promulgated regulations implementing the statutory suspension of alternative annuities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 031.2203(h). With respect to the statutory phrase "life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition," OPM incorporated by reference its preexisting regulatory definition--at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(2)-(3)--of the same statutory phrase contained in the OBRA of 1987. <span class="Italic">See</span> OBRA of 1987 Pub.

Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(2)-(3), the statutory phrase "life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition" is defined as "a medical condition so severe as to reasonably limit an individual's probable life expectancy to less than one year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that this regulatory definition was erroneous because it did not take into account all portions of the statutory language, specifically, that it took into account only the "life-threatening affliction" portion of the statutory language and not the "against equity and good conscience" or the "other critical medical condition" portion. We agree in part with the administrative judge's findings in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's apparent determination, we find that the phrase "against equity and good conscience," as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(B), does not constitute a separate standard for determining whether an individual qualifies for the statutory exception. Section 8343a(f)(2)(B) provides that an alternative annuity shall be allowed if disallowing such an annuity would be "against equity and good conscience, <span class="Italic">due</span> to a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition affecting such individual." (Emphasis added.) It is apparent that the phrase "against equity and good conscience" merely describes the justification for excepting individuals suffering from a "life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition," and does not constitute an independent basis for excepting individuals based on other types of reasons, such as financial status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge, however, that the regulatory definition does not adequately take into account the "other critical medical condition" portion of the statutory language. We find that the plain meaning of the statutory phrase "critical medical condition" is not limited to a condition likely to be fatal within one year, as defined by OPM regulation, but encompasses other types of serious medical conditions including, e.g., a condition likely to be fatal within several years. <span class="Italic">See Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span> (1990) (defining "critical" as, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "relating to or being the stage of a disease at which an abrupt change for better or worse may be expected" or "being or relating to an illness or condition involving danger of death"); <span class="Italic">Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</span> (1989) (defining "critical" as, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "dangerous"). To ignore the "other critical medical condition" portion of the statutory language would be contrary to the rule of statutory construction that all provisions of a statute be given meaning and that no part be rendered superfluous or insignificant. <span class="Italic">See Bonggat v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 175, 179 (1993); <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1992). Hence, we find that OPM's definition of this statutory phrase was too narrowly drawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues on petition for review that, because it has been charged with the administration of the statutory provision in question, the Board should give great deference to its implementing regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1012 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The Board will not follow the agency's interpretation, however, when there are compelling reasons to conclude that it is in conflict with the plain language of the governing statute. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> As discussed above, and that the implementing regulation is inconsistent with the governing statute because it fails to adequately take into count all portions of the statutory language, and unreasonably restricts the plain meaning of the statutory terms. We therefore find that OPM's interpretation is not entitled to our deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues on petition for review that Congress presumptively approved of and adopted OPM's preexisting (since 1988) regulatory interpretation of the statutory phrase "against equity and good conscience, due to a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition," used in the OBRA of 1987, when it re-used this same phrase in the OBRA of 1990. The pertinent statutory provision in the OBRA of 1987 required a one-year partial (40 percent) deferral of the "lump-sum credit," which was previously payable in full (100 percent) upon retirement, but allowed an exception to this partial deferral in situations where such a deferral "would be against equity and good conscience: due to a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition affecting such individual." OBRA of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, &#x00A7; 6001, 101 Stat. 1330-275, <span class="Italic">amended by</span> Pub. L. No. 101-103, &#x00A7; 6, 103 Stat. 672 (1989), <span class="Italic">amended by</span> Pub. L. No. 101-508, &#x00A7; 7001(a)(2)(C)(i) 104 Stat. 1388-328 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 8343a Historical and Statutory Notes (West Supp. 1993): 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207 (promulgated in 1988); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2208 (promulgated in 1991). Because it is manifest that this one-year deferral of the lump-sum credit would be "against equity and good conscience" as to an individual suffering from a medical condition likely to be fatal within one year, the regulatory interpretation of the statutory phrase would appear to be appropriate within the context of the OBRA of 1987.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of the pertinent provisions in the OBRA of 1990, however, the regulatory interpretation is problematic, as discussed above. The legislative history of the OBRA of 1990 sheds little light on the meaning of this statutory phrase, but we see nothing therein to indicate that the entitlement to an alternative annuity was intended to be narrowly and arbitrarily restricted to individuals suffering from conditions likely to be fatal within one year. Rather, the statutory language reasonably should be interpreted as referring to a medical condition that is likely to significantly shorten the individual's life (even if not necessarily likely to be fatal within one year) because, as to individuals suffering from such a medical condition, the effect of the ban on alternative annuities is that their probable premature death would preclude them from fully recovering even the moneys they actually paid into the Civil Service Retirement Fund. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(8); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that when Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law without change, Congress is presumed to have been aware of the administrative or judicial interpretation of the incorporated sections and to have adopted that interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 470 U.S. 768, 782 &#x0026; n.15 (1985); <span class="Italic">Steele v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 57 M.S.P.R. 458, 462 (1993). For the reasons discussed above, however, we find that this presumption is not tenable under the circumstances because OPM's regulatory interpretation of the governing statute is too narrowly drawn and is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and we agree, that the appellant did not establish that she had "a medical condition so severe as to reasonably limit [her] probable life expectancy to less than one year," as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(2)-(3). Because we find that this regulation, as applied to this case, constitutes an erroneous and unreasonable interpretation of the governing statute, we will look solely to the statutory language ("life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition") to determine whether the appellant qualifies for the exception to the ban on alternative annuities. <span class="Italic">See Buckley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 172, 176 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 932 F.2d 980 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The administrative judge found that the appellant had a "critical medical condition" on the basis of her end-stage renal disease and chronic renal failure. The administrative judge provided no reasons for this finding, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For an annuitant to establish her entitlement to an alternative annuity, she must submit to OPM evidence of a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition, certified by a physician, on or before the date she elects to receive an alternative annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(3)(iii). If the proffered medical condition is not one that constitutes <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence of a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition, OPM reviews the physician's certification to determine whether the cited condition is life-threatening or critical. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(3)(iv).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the medical evidence considered by OPM consisted of summaries of doctors' visits and test results. The evidence does not include any medical opinion as to the seriousness of the appellant's medical condition or conditions, and does not otherwise <span id="Page_4334"></span>show that the appellant suffered from a life-threatening or other critical medical condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the current record, we find that the appellant has not established that she suffered from a "life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition" at the time of her retirement. However, we find that she should be afforded another opportunity to prove her claim for an alternative annuity, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the statutory phrase "critical medical condition" is not limited to conditions that are likely to be fatal within one year, as defined by OPM's regulations, but includes conditions that are likely to be fatal within several years. Since this test is less stringent than the one formerly applied by OPM, it may be that, on remand, the appellant could prove her entitlement to an alternative annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, OPM failed to adequately apprise the appellant of what evidence was needed to establish her claim. In its initial decision, OPM simply stated that the appellant was not eligible for an alternative annuity because her employing agency did not certify that she met the necessary medical requirements. In its reconsideration decision, OPM simply stated that the appellant was not eligible for an alternative annuity based on its review of the medical evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Individuals requesting alternative annuities are usually not represented by an attorney. In addition, the applicants tend to be ill, even if their medical condition is ultimately found not to be life-threatening or critical. Moreover, such proceedings sold not be adversarial in nature. As the agency charged with the responsibility of administering civil service retirement law, OPM has an affirmative duty to fully and accurately inform claimants of their rights and obligations. <span class="Italic">See. e.g, Wilber v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 444, 447 (1991); <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 70, 74 (1989). Applicants for alternative annuities should not have to guess what medical evidence is required to establish their claims. We therefore find that OPM has an obligation to provide more than a conclusory statement that the applicant did not meet her burden of proof, and should provide at least as much guidance as it does in the disability retirement cases where the applicant is specifically apprised of the areas in which the medical evidence is deficient.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wutke v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 523, 526-30 (1995) (remanding to determine whether the appellant's medical problems met the statutory criterion of "other critical medical condition" and whether there was a basis for waiver of the time limit for electing an alternative annuity under the statute or regulation, a determination that would in part depend on whether a notice of election rights was required).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The alternate annuity with lump sum payment was for employees who were separated from the government involuntarily, other than for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency, a situation described in an appeal involving a group of employees affected by an agency restructuring in <span class="Italic">Allen v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 212, 216-22 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants claim the right to elect to receive an alternative form of annuity under former 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(A). We find, for the reasons below, that the right claimed by the appellants is dependent upon a determination in the first instance of whether they were "separated from the service involuntarily" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1). Thus, we will examine in this Opinion the circumstances relevant to proof of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. ch. 83. In this regard, the Board has long held that the determination of an involuntary separation for retirement purposes under 5 U.S.C. ch. 83 is totally separate and distinct from a determination of involuntary retirement or resignation for Board jurisdictional purposes under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75. <span class="Italic">Sanderson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to December 1, 1990, retiring employees could elect to receive an alternative form of annuity consisting of a "lump-sum credit" plus an appropriately reduced lifetime annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a; <span class="Italic">see Haywood v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 603, 606 (1994). By the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990, Pub. L.

The exception involved in these appeals was specified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(A) (1992), which was in effect at the time of the appellants' separations and thus is applicable in these appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanderson</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 319.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to a specific grant of statutory authority, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(a), OPM has promulgated regulations implementing the statutory suspension of alternative forms of annuities. <span class="Italic">See Haywood</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 607. With respect to the statutory phrase "separated from Government service involuntarily (other than for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency)," OPM's regulation provides that "[a]n individual whose annuity commences after December 1, 1990, and before October 1, 1994, may elect an alternative form of annuity only if that individual is...separated involuntarily other than for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(h)(1)(i)(B). In promulgating the interim version of this regulation, effective November 5, 1990, OPM provided the following supplementary information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The second exception is for nondisability retirees who are separated from Government service involuntarily, other than for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]ndividuals who retire under an "early out" authority under 5 U.S.C. 8336(d)(2) or 5 U.S.C. 8414(b)(1)(B), are not considered to be involuntarily separated, since the law specifically states that such persons are "separated from the service voluntarily."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">56 Fed. Reg. 6549 (1991). OPM's interpretation of the statutes it administers is entitled to considerable weight, especially where, as we find in these appeals for the reasons set forth in this Opinion, there are no compelling reasons to conclude that such an interpretation is erroneous or unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Andrada</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 233.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "early out" statute referenced by OPM, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d), provides, in relevant part: An employee who--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis supplied.) While the "early out" statute permits, under particular circumstances, employees to retire early and receive an immediate annuity, without regard to a determination of voluntariness under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d), the right of the appellants to elect to receive an alternative form of annuity under former 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(A) is subject to a determination by OPM that they were "separated from the service involuntarily" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1) rather than "voluntarily" under section 8336(d)(2). <span class="Italic">See Edgerton v.

In these appeals, because the appellants retired under the "early out" authority of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2), OPM found that their separations were voluntary and they are ineligible to elect to receive an alternative form of annuity under the former 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing OPM retirement decisions determining whether a separation is involuntary for purposes of a discontinued service retirement annuity under section 8336(d)(1), the Board has previously noted former Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supp. 831-1, subch.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to these appeals, the Board found subsequent to the appellants' retirements that the Postal Service's 1992-93 reorganization constituted a reduction in force (RIF) as to those preference-eligibles who were released from their competitive level by demotion as a result of the reorganization. <span class="Italic">Robinson v.

Evidence and argument that a presumably voluntary retirement was the product of agency coercion, misrepresentation, or duress is relevant to proof that the retirement was actually an adverse action (removal) under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75 that is directly appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Taylor v.

The right to a discontinued service retirement based on an "involuntary" separation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1) requires proof by an appellant that his separation is the result of an agency action or circumstances under FPM Supp. 831-1, subch.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon consideration of our analysis and findings above, we conclude that the appellants may not present individual claims that their retirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2) were involuntary on the basis of misinformation, coercion, or duress in the context of these Chapter 83 retirement appeals against OPM in which they seek to elect to receive an alternative form of annuity. Proof of misinformation, coercion, or duress, even if it were sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over a Chapter 75 appeal of an involuntary resignation, would not be sufficient to prove that an action by the Postal Service and circumstances set forth in FPM Supp. 831-1, subch. S11-2 have occurred that establish entitlement to a discontinued service retirement based on an involuntary separation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(1) and the right to elect to receive an alternative form of annuity under former 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(f)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the statutory limitation on alternative annuities, "[b]y Pub. L. No. 99-335, Title II, &#x00A7; 204(a) (June 6, 1986), Congress authorized OPM to prescribe regulations allowing Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) retirees to elect one of several alternative forms of annuities, including a lump sum payment with a reduced annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a. The law states, however, that disability retirees are excluded from this provision." <span class="Italic">Hoover v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 333, 335 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An alternative annuity option was considered in <span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 689, 690 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 3, 1987, the appellant requested OPM to allow her to elect an alternative annuity under Public Law 99-335. Section 204 of this law added a provision to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343 to allow employees to receive a lump-sum payment of their retirement contributions and a reduced monthly annuity.[1] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a. The amendment of section 8343 was effective on June 6, 1986. 100 Stat. 631. In its initial decision, OPM found that the appellant was not eligible for an alternative annuity under this provision because her annuity commenced on May 1, 1986, which was prior to the June 6, 1986 effective date of Public Law 99-335. Upon reconsideration, OPM affirmed its decision denying the appellant's request to elect an alternative annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The amendment of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343 to provide for alternative annuities was a provision of the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-335, title II, &#x00A7; 204(a), 100 Stat. 591. The FERS Act provided alternative annuities not only for employees who retired under FERS, but also for employees who retired under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a <span class="Italic">and</span> &#x00A7; 842a. The appellant, who had retired under the CSRS, sought to elect an alternative CSRS annuity, as provided for in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board honored the OPM regulation requiring that revocation of an alternative form of annuity be submitted in writing prior to OPM's authorization of the lump-sum payment that is a component of the alternative annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spaulding v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 57 (1989) (also noting that the appellant's election was informed, because he was given information concerning the tax consequences of the election to receive a lump-sum payment); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Speker v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 380 (1990) (immaterial that a notice was not provided by OPM as to election of annuity rights because the time for making the election had lapsed before the regulation requiring the notice came into effect). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ricer v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 187 (1989) (waiving time limit for election of change in annuity option when an OPM representative did not inform the appellant of the time or other requirements, including a spousal consent, for submitting the election notice to OPM).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM had no affirmative duty to provide notice of the statutory provision governing entitlement to elect an alternative annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LaBuy v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 581, 584 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Donlan v. OPM,</span> 907 F.2d 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1990), and <span class="Italic">Speker v. OPM,</span> 45 MSPR 380, 385-86 (1990)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Interest payments on lump sum distributions of alternative annuities were not authorized, <span class="Italic">Chappell v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 260, 263-64 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant characterizes his claim as one for lost investment income or for recovery of the amount by which his annuity was supposedly "discounted," in essence he seeks interest on the first installment of the lump-sum credit for the period between his retirement and the time payment was made. <span class="Italic">Cf. Library of Congress v. Shaw,</span> 478 U.S. 310, 321-22 (1986) (a party's request for compensation stemming from his belated receipt of payment on a debt is a claim for interest, regardless of how the party designates the claim). We have reopened this appeal for the limited purpose of addressing the claim for interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States is immune from a claim for interest on a sum due and owing to a private party in the absence of an express statutory provision indicating that Congress intended for interest to accrue. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw,</span> 478 U.S. at 317. <span class="Italic">See also Fidelity Construction Co. v. United States</span> 700 F.2d 1379, 1383: (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 464 U.S. 826 (1983) <span id="Page_4336"></span>(Congressional intent to permit the recovery of interest by successful claimants against the United States "cannot be implied")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kesselman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 293 (1991) we held, under an earlier version of the statute authorizing the payment of a lump-sum credit under an alternative annuity, that interest did not accrue on the first installment of the lump-sum credit between the time of the annuitant's retirement and the time that the first installment was paid. Although the pertinent statute has been amended, the provision for interest remains the same. <span class="Italic">See</span> P.L. No. 101-239, section 4005(b), 103 Stat. 2135, <span class="Italic">as amended</span> by P.L. No. 101-508, section 7001(a)(2) (reprinted at 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 8343a note (West Supp. 1992)). The statute provides that interest is payable on the second of two installments of the lump-sum credit, but it is silent with respect to the running of interest on the first installment. Since Congress has not explicitly authorized the payment of interest on the first installment of the lump-sum credit to those electing alternative annuities, the appellant cannot recover it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Board does not have the authority to grant equitable relief for the appellant's temporary inability to invest the first installment of his lump-sum credit. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414 (1990) (equitable considerations cannot serve as the basis for a payment from the federal Treasury when such payment is not otherwise permitted by law). We are also without authority to adjudicate the appellant's claim that the purported reduction in his annuity's value amounted to a taking of his property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. United States,</span> 715 F.2d 1148, 1153 (7th Cir. 1983) (federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims alleging a taking of property without just compensation where the amount sought is less than $10,000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 140, 143 (1992) (no interest for more than a year of delay in payment of lump sum).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an OPM form for electing an alternate annuity with a lump sum payment was so confusing that a reasonable person could not determine whether he was being required to determine whether to take the lump sum in one or two installments, the Board could require OPM to modify the payment to meet the interest of the annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Snow v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 364, 369-372 (1993).</p>
