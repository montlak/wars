<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-300"><span class="space">1.</span> Specific Grooming Standards, Exemptions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Several other components of grooming standards were considered against agency defenses of internal security requirements in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, Bureau of C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-051.html">62 FLRA 267</a>, 276 (2007) (remanded as to portion of Proposal 6, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>), including a section of Proposal 6, that "[e]xceptions to CBP's proposed personal appearance standards will be made for legitimate religious/cultural reasons," determined to be nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal requires the Agency to grant exceptions to its grooming standards, which standards, we have determined, constitute the exercise of the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. As such, the proposal would permit deviations from the Agency's grooming standards policy. Accordingly, we conclude that the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See Def. Logistics Council of AFGE Locals, </span>20 FLRA 166, 168 (1985),<span class="Italic"> aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds by Def. Logistics Council of AFGE Locals v. FLRA, </span>810 F.2d 234, 240 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (proposal providing exceptions to agency's policy affected right to determine its internal security practice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the proposal constitutes a sufficiently tailored arrangement, we conclude that it is not appropriate. In this regard, the Union asserts that allowing exceptions to the Agency's grooming standards policy for legitimate religious and cultural reasons would provide a "decided benefit" to officers by "precluding them from having to make a choice between protecting their country...and exercising deeply held religious and cultural beliefs. As an example, the Union refers to the cultural practice of Native Americans not to limit their hair length, which the Union's exhibit indicates may include hair below the shoulders.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Permitting employees to adhere to particular religious or cultural practices provides a benefit to employees.&#x2003;On the other hand, the Agency correctly asserts that the proposal would require it to grant exceptions to any and all grooming standards in any and all circumstances involving a legitimate cultural or religious reason. As the Union's example above demonstrates, the Agency would not be permitted to restrict hair length even in situations where an officer with below-the-shoulder hair was working around dangerous machinery or where such officer was "required to apprehend and control uncooperative and resistant individuals (who grab and pull such hair)." Even when the employee's religious or cultural reason for an exception may be "legitimate," this is a significant intrusion on the Agency's right, which, we conclude, outweighs the benefits to employees.[13] As such, we find that the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13] We note that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of religion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-1(a). In enforcing this law, courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have held that an employer is not required to accommodate an employee's <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious practice if such practice would impair workplace safety. <span class="Italic">See Bhatia v. Chevron, U.S.A., Inc., </span>734 F.2d 1382, 1383-84 (9th Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Draper v. United States Pipe &#x0026; Foundry Co., </span>527 F.2d 515, 521 (6th Cir. 1975); <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Lawrence Garrett, Sec., Dep't of the Navy, </span>1989 WL 609549 at 4 (EEOC) (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-051.html">62 FLRA 267</a>, 274 (2007) (remanded as to portion of Proposal 6, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;Internal Security Practices</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernails would permit officers to have hair and fingernails longer than permitted by the Agency's grooming standards policy. As such, these portions of Proposal 6 modify the Agency's grooming policy and, therefore, affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding whether these portions of the proposal are appropriate arrangements, the Agency does not dispute they are arrangements; the <span id="page_849"></span>Agency argues only that the portions are not appropriate arrangements because they excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices. Accordingly, we address only that issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>55 FLRA at 1175.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether these portions of the proposal excessively interfere with that right, we find that the Agency has failed to establish the safety-related burdens it asserts these portions of Proposal 6 create. In this connection, these portions of Proposal 6 permit male officers to exhibit the same hair and fingernail length that the Agency's policy permits female officers to exhibit. With regard to female officers, the portion of the proposal concerning fingernails permits such officers to have fingernails one-quarter inch longer than proposed by the Agency. With regard to hair length, the difference between the bottom of the shirt collar (under the Agency's policy) and "not below the shoulder" (under the Union proposal) would depend on the type of shirt worn, which is not described by the Agency. In these circumstances, the Agency has failed to explain how the Proposal 6 standards for men, which mirror the women's standards under the Agency's policy, and the Proposal 6 standards for women, which are only slightly different from the Agency's policy, would significantly burden the Agency by placing officers in a safety risk or preventing officers from being readily identifiable by the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the proposal's benefits to officers, the proposal provides them with "personal discretion" over their appearance. In seeking to ensure that the officers retain this discretion, the portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernail length only slightly modify the Agency's grooming standards policy. The Authority has held that a union's right to negotiate over appropriate arrangements includes the right to negotiate over proposals modifying agency decisions regarding those rights. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R5-184, </span>51 FLRA 386, 392 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the burdens alleged by the Agency do not outweigh the benefit these portions of Proposal 6 provide to the officers. In this regard, as the Agency has failed to explain how these portions would place officers at a safety risk or prevent the officers from being readily identifiable to the public, the Agency has not established identification or safety-related burdens on its management's right. In these circumstances, the Agency's asserted burdens do not outweigh the Union's right to negotiate over modifications to the Agency's grooming standards policy, particularly where, as here, those modifications are slight. Accordingly, we find that the portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernails do not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, these portions of Proposal 6 constitute appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(ii)&#x2003;Means of Performing Work</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have determined that the portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernail length do not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, it is necessary to address whether, as the Agency contends, these portions affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work. As we determined with respect to Proposal 3, the Agency's critical mission supports its decision to implement a grooming standards policy. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> at 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication that the portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernail length, which only slightly modify the Agency's grooming standards policy, would prevent the Agency from accomplishing the mission-related purposes for which it adopted the policy.<span class="Italic"> See AFGE, Local 2441 v. FLRA, </span>864 F.2d at 187. In this regard, the Agency adopted its grooming standards policy to ensure its officers were readily identifiable by the public and to ensure that officers could effectively employ law enforcement techniques, but the Agency has not provided any evidence establishing that the portions of Proposal 6 addressing hair and fingernails would interfere with the public's recognition of officers or prevent officers from effectively carrying out their law enforcement functions. <span class="Italic">See DHHS, </span>885 F.2d at 916-17; <span class="Italic">DOJ, </span>31 FLRA at 1136; <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>8 FLRA at 353. In addition, although these portions of the proposal vary from the Agency's policy, the Agency has not established that the variation is of such a "degree of departure" to warrant a conclusion that the proposal affects management's right to determine the means of performing work. <span class="Italic">DHHS,</span> 885 F.2d at 917. Accordingly, we find that these portions of Proposal 6 do not affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>

FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008), <span class="Italic">post</span>), determined to be nonnegotiable, however, a proposal concerning facial hair:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Beards and other facial hair shall be permitted except where there is a reasonable likelihood that an officer will need to use a respirator or other device in the performance of his job duties and the device requires a cleanly shaven face.&#x2003;The parties agree that for the overwhelming majority of CBP officers, there is not a reasonable likelihood that the officer will need to use such a device. Mustaches and beards will be neatly trimmed and groomed, clean and will not be of excessive length, i.e. no longer than 1/2 inch to one inch in length.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained, 62 FLRA at 278-79:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that the facial hair section of the proposal would require any officer who was required to use a respirator or other safety gear to shave to the extent necessary to properly use the gear.&#x2003;However, it is undisputed that the proposal does not account for emergency situations where, as the Agency claims, officers may be required to use a respirator or other device to "save their own life or the life of another officer or member of the trade or traveling public[.] In these circumstances, officers would not have the opportunity to shave "to the extent necessary" to properly operate a respirator. As such, this portion of the proposal modifies the Agency's policy by limiting the circumstances under which the officers could operate a respirator or other device. Accordingly, this portion of the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the purposes of this decision, we assume that this portion of Proposal 6 is a sufficiently tailored arrangement. With regard to whether this arrangement is appropriate, although officers would benefit from the proposal by being permitted to exercise their personal choice to have facial hair, the proposal also would effectively preclude the Agency from requiring officers who have facial hair to use respirators in an emergency situation. On balance, we find that the burden on the Agency's ability to safeguard its personnel and control how its work is performed outweighs any benefit the proposal may provide to the officers. As such, we conclude that this portion of the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;Internal Security Practices</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The portions of Proposal 6 concerning rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings would permit officers to wear a greater number of each of those items than is permitted under the Agency's grooming standards policy. As such, these portions of the proposal modify the Agency's policy. Accordingly, these portions of Proposal 6 affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding whether these portions of the proposal are appropriate arrangements, the Agency does not dispute they are arrangements; the Agency argues only that the portions are not appropriate arrangements because they excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices. Accordingly, we consider only that issue.<span class="Italic"> See </span>Reply at 11-12; <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 55 FLRA at 1175.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether these portions of the proposal excessively interfere with that right, we find that the Agency has failed to establish the safety-related burdens it asserts these portions of Proposal 6 would create. In this regard, the proposal would permit officers to wear one additional ring. The Agency has not demonstrated how this presents a greater safety risk for the Agency or its officers, particularly in view of the Agency's agreement with a different union that officers may wear three rings. Similarly, the Agency has not explained how permitting one bracelet of any type would create a greater safety risk than the Agency's policy permitting one medical alert bracelet. In addition, as both the Agency's grooming standards policy and the Union's proposal require that necklaces be concealed, the Agency has failed to establish how the Union's proposal--permitting an unlimited number of concealed necklaces--poses a greater safety risk than the Agency's policy. As for earrings, the Agency limits female officers to one pair earrings, while the Union's proposal would permit two pairs. There is no evidence, and the Agency fails to explain, how the proposal would place officers at an increased security risk. Further, the Agency does not explain how these portions of Proposal 6 prevent officers from being readily identifiable by the public or effectively employing law enforcement techniques.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_850"></span>With regard to the proposal's benefits to officers, the proposal provides them with "personal discretion" over their appearance. As with the portions of Proposal 6 concerning hair and fingernail length, in seeking to ensure that the officers retain this discretion, the portions of Proposal 6 concerning rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings only slightly modify the Agency's grooming standards policy. As noted above, the Union has a right to negotiate over appropriate arrangements, including the right to negotiate over proposals modifying agency decisions regarding management's rights. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R5-184, </span>51 FLRA at 392.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the burdens alleged by the Agency do not outweigh the benefits provided to the officers. In this connection, although the Agency asserts that these portions of Proposal 6 would place officers at a safety risk and prevent them from being readily identifiable to the public, the Agency has not established identification or safety-related burdens. As such, the Agency's asserted burdens do not outweigh the Union's right to negotiate over modifications to the Agency's grooming standards policy, particularly where, as here, those modifications are slight. Accordingly, we find that the portions of Proposal 6 concerning rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings do not excessively interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices and, thus, these portions of Proposal 6 constitute appropriate arrangements.</p>

Similar to our finding with regard to Proposal 3, although the Agency's critical mission supports its decision to implement a grooming standards policy, the Agency has not established that the portions of Proposal 6 concerning rings, necklaces, bracelets, and earrings prevent the Agency from accomplishing the mission-related purposes for which it adopted the policy. In this connection, the Agency adopted its grooming standards policy to ensure its officers were readily identifiable by the public and to ensure that officers could effectively employ law enforcement techniques. However, there is no indication that wearing one more ring, bracelet, or pair of earrings than permitted by the Agency's policy, or wearing multiple concealed necklaces, would interfere with the public's recognition of officers or prevent officers from effectively carrying out their law enforcement functions. <span class="Italic">See DHHS, </span>885 F.2d at 916-17; <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 31 FLRA at 1136; <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>8 FLRA at 353.

Officers will continue to be permitted to wear uniform items, e.g. short-sleeved shirts, even if tattoos are not concealed":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;Internal Security Practices</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under both the proposal and the Agency's policy, obscene, racially motivated, and gang-related tattoos must be concealed. The difference between the two concerns tattoos that are not obscene, racially motivated, or gang-related. The Union's proposal would permit officers to wear the uniform even if such tattoos would not be concealed; the Agency's policy would require officers to cover, to the greatest extent possible, all such tattoos. We find that this portion of Proposal 6 would modify the Agency's grooming standards policy. As such, this portion of the proposal affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding whether this portion of Proposal 6 is an appropriate arrangement, the Agency does not dispute it is an arrangement; the Agency argues only that it is not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right.

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the benefits to officers, this portion of Proposal 6 would permit officers to "continue to wear short-sleeved shirts as long as any exposed tattoo [i]s not obscene, racially motivated or gang-related" and would provide officers with "personal discretion" over their appearance. In seeking to ensure that officers are able to continue to work comfortably and retain discretion over their appearance, this portion of Proposal 6 only slightly modifies the Agency's grooming standards policy.

As found above, the Agency's critical mission supports its decision to implement a grooming standards policy. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> at 11. However, nothing in this portion of Proposal 6 prevents the Agency from accomplishing the mission-related purposes for which the Agency adopted its grooming standards policy. In this regard, although the Agency adopted its grooming standards policy to ensure its officers were readily identifiable by the public and to ensure that officers could effectively employ law enforcement techniques, there is no indication that permitting officers to display tattoos that are not obscene, racially motivated, or gang-related would interfere with the public's recognition of officers or prevent officers from effectively carrying out their law enforcement functions. <span class="Italic">See DHHS, </span>885 F.2d at 916-917; <span class="Italic">DOJ, </span>31 FLRA at 1136; <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>8 FLRA at 353.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148, 1154-55 (D.C. Cir. 2008), sent the case back to FLRA for further consideration a component of Proposal 6, involving beard grooming standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues that the Authority erred in concluding both that a portion of Proposal 6--which would allow officers to maintain neatly-trimmed beards of up to one inch unless there was a reasonable likelihood they would be required to use respirators would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices and that the proposal did not qualify as an appropriate arrangement. For the reasons given above, however, we see no abuse of discretion in the Authority's finding of a reasonable link between CBP's grooming standards policy and its internal security. And because Proposal 6 was plainly intended to modify the policy, Negotiability Order, 62 F.L.R.A. at 278, the Authority acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously in finding that it would affect CBP's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That said, we agree with the union that the Authority's appropriate arrangement analysis was faulty. The Authority found that the relevant portion of Proposal 6 would excessively interfere with CBP's management rights by preventing the agency from "requiring officers who have facial hair to use respirators in an emergency situation."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 278. Yet the Authority pointed to no evidence that CBP had any respirator policy whatsoever. Indeed, while CBP claims that it had a goal of adopting policies that would require respirators and of training officers in their use, Agency Reply to Union Resp. 10; Oral Arg. at 22:20-22:48, the record contains evidence, albeit fragmentary, that CBP's current policies did not require officers to use respirators, Union Resp. to Agency Stmt. of Position Ex. 13; that many CBP officers were never even issued respirators, e.g.,<span class="Italic"> id. </span>Exs. 6, 910; and that CBP relied not on its own officers but on other agencies to respond to emergency situations requiring respirators, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>Ex. 8 (indicating that the Port Huron office calls the local fire department to respond to situations requiring respirators). One email stated that CBP officers in at least one location are currently "not allowed to enter any environment where the use of a respirator is required," and that the hazardous environment policy "is to identify when a hazardous condition exists, restrict access by establishing a quarantine zone, and notify[ ] <span id="page_851"></span>appropriate port authorities or other haz[ardous] mat[erials] units to respond to the situation."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>Ex. 12. Though if credited, this evidence would significantly diminish CBP's interest in facilitating its officers' use of respirators, the Authority considered none of it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, contrary to the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> standard, the Authority failed to base its appropriate arrangement analysis on record evidence. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 404 F.3d at 458 ("[T]he Authority must consider the evidence in the record before it, conduct the balanced inquiry required by the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> line of precedent, and then reach its conclusion as to whether the proposal `excessively interferes' with the agency's internal security practices."). Accordingly, we shall remand Proposal 6 to the Authority so that it may determine, based on record evidence, whether the portion governing facial hair constitutes an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, FLRA decided the grooming standard was negotiable. The benefit to the employees outweighed the minimal effect on agency security practices. <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 63 FLRA 309, 309-12 (2009) (aff'd on reconsideration, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 64 FLRA 395 (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>) determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;The Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed portion of Proposal 6 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Beards and other facial hair shall be permitted except where there is a reasonable likelihood that an officer will need to use a respirator or other device in the performance of his job duties and the device requires a cleanly shaven face. The parties agree that for the overwhelming majority of [Agency] officers, there is not a reasonable likelihood that the officer will need to use such a device.

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA at 274.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth by the Authority in <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> the parties agree that this portion of Proposal 6 is intended to modify the Agency's grooming standards policy to permit officers to have beards and other facial hair if the facial hair is clean, neatly trimmed and groomed, and no longer than one-half inch to one inch in length. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA at 278. The parties also agree that, if the officers are required to use a respirator or other device, then they would be required to shave to the extent necessary to use the respirator or other device. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Background</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NTEU</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> the Authority found, as relevant here, that the portion of Proposal 6 (a multi-part proposal) concerning facial hair was outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, the Authority determined that the facial hair portion of Proposal 6 (hereinafter the proposal) affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA at 278-79. The Authority noted the parties' agreement that the proposal would require any officer who needed to use a respirator or other protective gear to shave to the extent necessary to properly use the gear. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 278. However, the Authority found it undisputed that the proposal does not account for emergency situations in which officers would be required to use the protective gear without first having time to shave. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority thus concluded that the proposal limited the circumstances under which officers could operate a respirator or other protective gear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority found that the proposal does not constitute an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 278-79. For purposes of its decision, the Authority assumed that the proposal is an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, the Authority found that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement because its benefit to officers--permission to exercise a personal preference to have facial hair--is outweighed by the burden on the Agency's ability to safeguard its personnel and control how its work is performed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit concluded, as relevant here, that the Authority acted properly in determining that the proposal would affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. 550 F.3d at 1154. However, the court agreed with the Union that the Authority's finding that the proposal did not constitute an appropriate arrangement was flawed because the Authority's analysis was not based on record evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1155. Accordingly, the court remanded the proposal to the Authority "so that it may determine, based on the record evidence, whether the portion governing facial hair constitutes an appropriate arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court directed the Authority, on remand, to consider the evidence in the record before it, conduct the balanced inquiry required by the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>), and then reach its conclusion as to whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement. 550 F.3d at 1155.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the court found that the Authority properly determined that the facial hair portion of Proposal 6 affects the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices 550 F.3d at 1154-55. However, the court remanded Proposal 6 to the Authority so that we may determine whether this portion is an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1155.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG.</span> Doing so, the Authority first determines whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31. To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, the burden is on the union to articulate how employees will be adversely affected by the exercise of a management right and how the proposal compensates for the adverse effects. <span class="Italic">Id.

In addition, the claimed arrangement must be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local Rl-100,</span> 39 FLRA 762, 766 (1991). If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31-33. The Authority determines whether an arrangement is appropriate by weighing the competing practical needs of employees and managers. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 31-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facial hair portion of Proposal 6 addresses employees' preferences to exercise their personal choice to have facial hair. This competes with the Agency's preference to establish an internal security practice of ensuring that officers required to use respirators or other protective gear can do so effectively. Pursuant to <span class="Italic">KANG,</span> the Authority balances these competing factors by ascertaining the nature and extent of the limitation imposed by the proposed arrangement on the exercise of a management right. The Agency has the burden of raising and supporting the argument that the proposal excessively interferes with the Agency's exercise of its management right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b) (The agency has the burden of raising and supporting arguments that the proposal or provision is outside the duty to bargain.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has met its burden under <span class="Italic">KANG</span> to articulate an adverse effect on employees from the exercise of a management right, i.e., interference with the freedom of employees to make personal grooming decisions. The Agency, by failing to respond to the Union's assertion of adverse effect, has conceded the point. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(2) (Failure to respond to an argument or assertion raised by the other party will, when appropriate, be deemed a concession to such argument or assertion.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, although the Agency asserts that the proposal excessively interferes with its right to determine internal security practices, the Agency has offered no record evidence that Agency officers are required to use respirators or other protective gear requiring a cleanly shaven face. Further, the Union counters the Agency's excessive interference argument with evidence that in seven offices of the Agency, which employ a total of more than 1,000 officers, respirators and other protective gear requiring a cleanly shaven face are neither provided nor required to be used. The court characterized this evidence as "fragmentary." 550 F.3d at 1155. However, even so, the Agency made no attempt in its reply to identify any specific inaccuracies in this evidence or to dispute its relevance to the issue of whether the facial hair portion of Proposal 6 is an appropriate arrangement. Likewise, the Agency did not, in its statement of position, in its reply, or in its response to the Union's request for information, submit any evidence that Agency officers are provided with and required to use respirators.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, on balance, the burden on the Agency's exercise of its right to determine internal security practices does not outweigh the undisputed benefits that the facial hair portion of Proposal 6 provides to officers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP,</span> 64 FLRA 395, 396-97 (2010), was a reconsideration decision based on FLRA's error of not earlier considering the agency's argument that the proposal concerning facial hair interfered with the agency's right to determine the means of performing work. FLRA reconfirmed the negotiability of the 2004 proposal (over the dissent of Member Beck):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether a proposal affects management's right to determine the means of performing work, the Authority first examines whether the proposal concerns a "means." <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 62 FLRA 267, 273 (2007) (<span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>). In this regard, the term "means" refers to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work." <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 49,</span> 52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996). Second, it must be shown that: (1) <span id="page_852"></span>there is a direct and integral relationship between the means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the means was adopted. <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> 62 FLRA at 273. Consistent with this framework, the Authority has held that an agency's determination that "uniformed officers must adhere to grooming standards to ensure that such officers are readily recognized" constitutes a determination regarding the means of performing work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, INS,</span> 31 FLRA 1123, 1136 (1988) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, not all proposals to modify an agency's determination regarding grooming standards affect the right to determine the means of performing work. In this regard, the D.C. Circuit and the Authority have determined that proposals providing grooming standards that vary from an agency's standards do not affect the right to determine the means of performing work if the proposals do not impede the public's recognition of an agency's uniformed officers. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of HHS, Indian Health Serv., Okla. City v. FLRA,</span> 885 F.2d 911, 916-17 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">DHHS</span>); <span class="Italic">DOJ,</span> 31 FLRA at 1136. In <span class="Italic">DHHS,</span> the court found that assessing whether a proposal affects that management right depends on "the degree of departure from agency policy implicit in [the] particular union proposal, the type of agency involved, and the agency's specific needs and requirements." 885 F.2d at 917. In particular, the court stated that proposals providing grooming standards that "differ in details from the methods and means adopted by that agency[,]" but that do not eliminate them or make them optional "are not beyond the scope of collective bargaining[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 916-17. As the court observed in another decision concerning the uniforms worn by prison guards, the appropriate inquiry is "whether a union counter-proposal permits the accomplishment of the agency's mission-related purpose while modifying some particulars of its policy." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2441 v. FLRA,</span> 864 F.2d 178, 187 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Local 2441 v. FLRA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency states that its mission is "preventing terrorists and terrorists['] weapons from entering the United States[.]" This mission supports the Agency's decision to implement a grooming standards policy designed to ensure that its officers are readily identifiable to the public and effectively employ law enforcement techniques. However, as discussed below, nothing in Proposal 6 is of such a "degree of departure" from the Agency's policy so as to affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important to examine the wording of the proposal.&#x2003;Consistent with that wording, officers would not be permitted to wear facial hair when there is a "reasonable likelihood" that they would need to use a respirator or other device "in the performance of...job duties and the device requires a cleanly shaven face." <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> 63 FLRA at 309. Thus, if the proposal were adopted, then the Agency would be permitted to direct an employee to shave on the ground that there was the requisite "reasonable likelihood." [4] As such, the proposal neither "completely eliminates" nor "makes optional" the Agency's grooming standards policy of not allowing facial hair in order to ensure that officers are able to employ such safety equipment effectively. <span class="Italic">See DHHS,</span> 885 F.2d at 916-17; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2441 v. FLRA,</span> 864 F.2d at 184. In this regard, <span class="Italic">DHHS</span> makes clear that where, as here, the proposal only "provid[es] for grooming standards which vary" from those adopted by the agency, the proposal does not "completely eliminate" the agency's policy and, thus, does not affect management's right. <span class="Italic">DHHS,</span> 885 F.2d at 916-17.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;An employee or the Union could, of course, grieve such direction--after the fact--on the ground that there was no requisite reasonable likelihood. However, that a proposal, if adopted, would be subject to arbitral review provides no basis for finding the proposal outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DHS, U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.,</span> 63 FLRA 505, 509 (2009); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Dep't of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals,</span> 42 FLRA 1351, 1358 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the portion of the proposal providing that the "overwhelming majority of [Agency] officers" have no such reasonable likelihood, the Agency has not provided evidence--in response to evidence offered by the Union--establishing that the statement is inaccurate. <span class="Italic">NTEU II,</span> 63 FLRA at 311. Moreover, the statement, even if inaccurate, does not require the Agency to take, or refrain from taking, any specific action. Thus, it does not affect management's right to determine the means of performing work. At most, if adopted, it creates an expectation regarding the numbers of employees who may be required to be clean shaven.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Of course, we do not encourage parties to include wording in contracts that creates false impressions. However, this is a matter concerning the merits of the proposal that the parties should resolve either bilaterally or, if necessary, with the assistance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel. It is important to note, in this regard, that requiring negotiations over a proposal does not require agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the proposal does not affect the Agency's right to determine the means of performing work.</p>
