<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-381"><span class="space">C.</span> DURATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA resolved as negotiable Provision 4 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 53 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Material Transp. Office</span>, 42 FLRA 938, 949 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity agrees that details of employees will be kept within the shortest practicable time limits as required by this Agreement, applicable regulations and the latest Office of Personnel Management Instructions.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to its negotiability, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 53</span>, 42 FLRA at 952-56:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4 would require management to restrict details to "the shortest practicable time limits" as required by the parties' contract, applicable regulations and the latest OPM Instructions. The Union explains that Provision 4 requires management to follow the latest OPM instructions and other applicable regulations when detailing employees to positions. The Union further explains that the provision requires "only such specific actions as are extrinsically required of the Agency."... In our view, the Union's explanation is consistent with the wording of the provision and we find, therefore, that the effect of the proposal is to require management to limit the length of details as prescribed by the latest applicable regulations and OPM instructions. The provision would not require management to comply with regulations or instructions that are eliminated during the term of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that limit the duration of a detail or temporary assignment directly interfere with management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.... Prior to the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, proposals requiring management to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute in accordance with applicable regulations were found to be within the duty to bargain because such proposals only contractually recognized external limitations on management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, however, in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Dept. of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA No. 31 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), the Authority reexamined its position on external limitations on management rights in light of the holding of the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>. With respect to management's rights under the Statute, the Court held that the Statute "does not empower unions to enforce all 'external limitations' on management rights, but only limitations contained in 'applicable laws.'" <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. at 1628. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, we held that, insofar as management rights under section 7106(a)(2) are concerned, proposals that require compliance with applicable laws do not interfere with the exercise of such rights<span class="Italic">. Compare American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Department of Education Council of AFGE Locals and U.S. Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1075-76 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991)...(proposals requiring management to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute in accordance with applicable laws directly interfere with the exercise of such rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also held, for reasons discussed fully in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, that the term "applicable laws" in section 7106(a)(2) includes, among other things, provisions in the United States Code as well as rules and regulations having "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 42 FLRA No. 31, slip op. at 14-15. As relevant here, we held that agency regulations must have certain substantive and procedural characteristics in order to constitute regulations having the force and effect of law. Specifically, agency regulations have the force and effect of law, so as to constitute "applicable laws," if they: (1) are issued pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; (2) affect individual rights and obligations; and (3) are promulgated in accordance with applicable procedural requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, slip op. at 16-17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 4 would require management to contractually recognize external limitations on its exercise of a management right.&#x2003;Because the provision concerns contractual recognition of external limitations on management's right, we find that the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> and our decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> are applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that Provision 4 would restrict details to the "shortest practicable time limits" as required by the parties' contract, applicable regulations and the latest OPM instructions. According to the Union, "Provision 4...does not involve a specific external authority."... The Agency, on the other hand, contends that the provision concerns requirements contained in FPM Chapter 300-20, subchapter 8-5. The wording of the provision refers to "Agreement, applicable regulations" and "[OPM] Instructions." Because the wording of the provision does not specifically identify the OPM instructions involved and because the Union has not provided information as to which OPM instructions are intended, we are unable to determine the extent to which the provision limits the Agency's exercise of its management's rights under section 7106(a)(2). That is, we are unable to determine whether, consistent with IRS, Provision 4 requires compliance only with regulations having the force and effect of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, based on <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, to the extent that the term "OPM instructions" refers to properly promulgated agency regulations that are issued pursuant to statutory authority and affect individual rights and obligations, such instructions have the "force and effect of law" and, thus, constitute applicable laws under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. Such instructions constitute enforceable external limitations on the Agency's exercise of its rights under section 7106(a)(2). Therefore, to the extent that it concerns such instructions, Provision 4 is negotiable because it would only require the Agency to comply with enforceable external limitations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, to the extent that Provision 4 requires details in compliance with Government-wide regulations not having the force and effect of law, we find, for the reasons discussed below, that it is a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Provision 4 has the same effect as Provision 6 in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, SEIU, AFL-CIO and Veterans Administration, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Department of Memorial Affairs</span>, 40 FLRA 657 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>). In <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, we were presented with the question of whether Provision 6, which required management to exercise its right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute in accordance with applicable Government-wide regulations, was negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Noting <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> that proposals requiring "management to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(2) in accordance with Government-wide regulations are negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute even if Government-wide regulations do not constitute 'applicable law' within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute." 40 FLRA at 681. Relying on the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, we found that the provision in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, which concerned applicable Government-wide regulations pertaining to sick leave, constituted a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute even if the regulations did not constitute "applicable law" under 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span> and <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span> is applicable to Provision 4 because the issues involved are similar to those presented in those cases. To ignore those cases in our consideration of Provision 4 would lead to conflicting and anomalous results on similar provisions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Provision 4 is intended as an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by management's decision to assign employees. The provision provides a mechanism to ensure Agency compliance with applicable regulations when assigning employees, that is, detailing employees to positions. The provision mitigates the adverse effects on employees of being deprived of the protections afforded by applicable regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the provision is an appropriate arrangement because it does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Provision 4 would require the Agency to comply with the latest applicable regulations and OPM instructions limiting the duration of a detail. The provision would benefit employees by providing them with some assurance that the duration of an assignment to a detail would be consistent with regulations. Employees would have assurance that they would not be deprived of rights and protections afforded to them by Government-wide regulations concerning details. On the other hand, the provision, as mentioned, would merely require the Agency to comply with applicable regulations when assigning employees to details.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[T]he existence of applicable laws, rules and regulations already serves to limit agency action and indicates that an agency's interest in being able to act without regard to those provisions and without challenge to the legality of its actions, such as in arbitration procedures, is negligible." <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1078. We find, therefore, that the provision does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Administration</span>, 40 FLRA at 681-682; <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1078. Accordingly, we conclude that Provision 4, to the extent that it concerns Government-wide regulations <span id="page_899"></span>not having the force and effect of law, constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-82 and Dept. of Navy, Navy Exch., Naval Air Station, Jacksonville</span>, 43 FLRA 25, 36-40 (1991), next declared negotiable as an appropriate arrangement Provision 4, prohibiting details from normally exceeding a maximum of three months to a position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision benefits employees...where the work of a detail would extend beyond 3 months by ensuring that, in normal circumstances, another qualified employee would be assigned to the detail and would thereby gain the experience of performing that work. Further, the provision does not preclude the Agency in all situations from extending details beyond 3 months, but permits the Agency to extend details in unusual circumstances....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot</span>, 44 FLRA 738, 754, 755-58 (1992), required negotiations on Provision 5, seeking agreement that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Details will be made for brief periods to meet the particular needs of the situation requiring the temporary service of an employee.&#x2003;The duration of details will conform to the time limits established by regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Limits on the duration of details, or temporary duty assignments, are not automatically negotiable as appropriate arrangements. A record still must be established that allows FLRA to assess benefits and detriments of the proposals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1658 and Dept. of Army, Army Tank-Automotive Command</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1376 (1992) (Provision 4). A contract limit on the duration of TDY assignments was precluded in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Locals No. 163 and DOD, Defense Contract Audit Agency</span>, 51 FLRA 1504, 1514-16 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that similar proposals were previously found by the Authority to constitute arrangements.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tidewater</span> <span class="Italic">Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO and Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 31 FLRA 131, 141 (1988), <span class="Italic">order denying</span> <span class="Italic">reconsideration as to other matters</span>, 32 FLRA 98 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>) (provision limiting details or loans of employees to 90 days); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1658 and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Tank-Automotive Command, Warren, Michigan</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1380 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Tank-Automotive Command</span>), (provision limiting assignments in the continental United States to no more than 15 work days). However, subsequent to the decisions in <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span> and <span class="Italic">Tank-Automotive Command</span>, the Authority concluded, based on various court decisions, that "an arrangement must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering adverse effects flowing from the exercise of management's rights and cannot be so broad in its sweep that it applies to all employees regardless of whether they are likely to be adversely affected by management action that comes within the purview of management's rights." <span class="Italic">Patent and</span> <span class="Italic">Trademark Office</span>, 49 FLRA at 184. As the decisions in the <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span> and <span class="Italic">Tank-Automotive Command</span> did not address tailoring, they do not support a conclusion that this proposal is an arrangement because their reasoning concerning that question has been effectively overruled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union asserts that the duration of TDY assignments "could surely adversely affect many of the individuals within the bargaining unit, in that it disrupts such things as, but not limited to, spousal arrangements on numerous items, personal expenses, child care, and car pools." However, the Union does not assert that all bargaining unit employees would experience disruptions. Furthermore, the disruptions described by the Union would not apply to all employees covered by the proposal. For example, spousal arrangements would only be a consideration for married employees; concerns about child care obviously would not arise for childless employees; and car pool arrangements would not be a factor for employees not in car pools. Moreover, the Union fails to explain, and it is not otherwise apparent, how TDY affects personal expenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency notes, without contravention by the Union, that each employee covered by this proposal signs an agreement "acknowledging that his condition of employment will include rotation and reassignments to other than their [sic] permanent duty station in order to accomplish the [A]gency's mission." As such, employees can anticipate that TDY assignments will be a regular part of their jobs. Additionally...the proposal does not exclude all voluntary TDY assignments from the maximum duration of time spent by an individual employee on TDY. It seems contrary to common sense to view employees as adversely affected by time spent on TDY assignments for which they have volunteered. In sum, we find that the proposal lacks the tailoring necessary to constitute...an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Other proposed contract limits on details to positions of higher and lower grades were nonnegotiable, for lack of proper support of negotiability arguments, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 61 FLRA 209, 217 (2005). Proposal 8 provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;A detail to a lower grade position normally shall not exceed three (3) months; otherwise, details shall not normally exceed four (4) months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Details to the same or higher grade positions [ ] normally shall not be extended for more than four (4) months. Two weeks prior to the extension, the Union shall be provided with the name of the employee, the employee's permanent position, the position to which the employee is being detailed, the effective date of the extension, the duration of the extension, and the reason for the extension.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal in<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 12</span> was nonnegotiable, 61 FLRA at 218-19:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The right to decide when an assignment should begin and end is inherent in the right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 31 FLRA 31, 33 (1988) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). Thus, the right to assign employees includes the right to determine the duration of an assignment. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1317 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 37 FLRA 263, 274 (1990)); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 31 FLRA at 33. Proposals that limit the duration of details therefore affect the exercise of management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3172</span>, 48 FLRA 489, 491-92 (1993) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3172</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1658</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1379 (1992); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 31 FLRA at 33-34). Moreover, the Authority has consistently held that the use of certain qualifying language in a proposal does not eliminate the effect of the proposal on the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3172</span>, 49 FLRA 302, 308 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1760</span>, 46 FLRA 1285, 1288-89 (1993);<span class="Italic"> Local R5-82</span>, 43 FLRA at 37-40. Specifically, a proposal providing that details will normally be limited to 3 months has been held to affect management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Local R5-82</span>, 43 FLRA at 38. Because subsection (a) provides that details to lower-graded positions normally will be limited to 3 months, consistent with <span class="Italic">Local R5-82</span>, it affects management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states, with no supporting argument, that subsection (a) is a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Union Response at tenth unnumbered page. In the absence of any argument, or citation to Authority precedent, such a bare assertion is insufficient to demonstrate the negotiability of the proposal under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 403, 411 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that subsection (a) is intended to minimize the adverse effect of such a detail on employees and claims that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). However, we find that the Union has failed to support that claim. Specifically, a threshold question under the Authority's analytical framework for determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement is whether the proposal addresses the adverse effects of a management right on employees. In order to resolve that question, the Authority examines evidence as to the claimed adverse effect. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union herein fails to explain how employees are adversely affected by a detail to a lower-graded position. In terms of its impact on the employee, it is not clear how a detail to a lower-graded position would differ from a detail to any other position, whether of the same grade or a higher grade. The employee is doing the work of a position that is not his or her permanent position, but there is no explanation as to how that would adversely affect the employee. In particular, although the Union cites <span class="Italic">Local R5-82</span>, wherein the Authority held that a proposal providing that details to lower-graded positions would normally be limited to three months constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Union makes no attempt to explain how the adverse effect on employees found in that case would be the same as the adverse effect claimed in this case. In the absence of any evidence as to the manner in which a detail to a lower-graded position would adversely affect unit employees in this case, the Union has not demonstrated that the proposal is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3172</span>, 48 FLRA at 493.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even assuming that subsection (a) constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, the Union has failed to create a record sufficient for the Authority to assess the benefits to employees that are to be derived from the proposal. Consequently, the Authority is unable to balance the benefits to employees against the effect of the proposal on management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the Union has failed to provide a basis for determining whether subsection (a) constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), and because subsection (a) affects management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), it is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-115.html">60 FLRA 576</a>, 580 (2005) (setting aside arbitration award: proposal addressing temporary duty assignments sought by volunteers does not address adverse effect resulting from exercise of management right).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1991 proposals placing specific limitations on the duration of details were generally nonnegotiable. They directly interfered with the right of management to assign employees. They were not appropriate arrangements if the union did not identify particular adverse effects to employees resulting from lengthy details and no adverse effects could reasonably be inferred from the facts of record. FLRA declined to presume that lengthy details necessarily adversely affected employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493, 510 (1987). Another decision assumed the adverse impact, however, and decided that a limitation of 90 days on a detail excessively interfered with the right to assign work under the circumstances. <span id="page_900"></span><span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 31 FLRA 131, 139-40 (1988). A proposal was nonnegotiable that, "to the maximum extent possible," an employee not be detailed to certain duties for more than 70 days in a year unless he freely volunteered for a longer period. The qualifying phrase, suggesting retention of management discretion, did not make the proposal negotiable. The assignments would be subject to arbitral review, infringing on the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 16 FLRA 251, 251-52 (1984). A demand was nonnegotiable that required the agency to restrict to an absolute minimum the detailing of employees to lower-graded positions. The clause restricted the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 FLRA 1051, 1059-60 (1986). Nonnegotiable was a procedure that permitted management to place nurses on extended details only when that solution would be more practical than any other and for the shortest amount of time. The proposal placed a substantive condition on the right of the agency to assign employees. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 458, 460 (1987). A nonnegotiable proposal required that a detail into an exchange program be for one year. Management has the right, as a part of its right to assign employees, to decide the duration of the work assigned. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 18 FLRA 241, 243 (1985). Omission from a contract proposal of the circumstances described in the former FPM Chapter 300, Subch. 8-3, allowing details, indicated that the proposal sought to circumscribe management's right to assign employees and was nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">NFFE and Dept. of Interior, Geological Survey, E. Mapping Agency</span>, 21 FLRA 1105, 1108-09 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 150 and VAMC, Milwaukee</span>, 35 FLRA 521, 533-35 (1990) (Provision 6: the same effect as to restrictions in the former FPM Letter 300-32).
