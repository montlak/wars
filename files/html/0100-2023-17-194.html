<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-192"><span class="space">a.</span> Merit Promotion</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may determine that a selection process is flawed without interfering with management's right to select employees, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 72 FLRA 541, 72 FLRA 541, 546-47 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman DuBester concurring and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award and remedies excessively interfere with the Agency's management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i)--specifically, the right "with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from...among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion."[57] More generally, management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) include the right to determine the qualifications, skills, and abilities needed to perform the work of a position and the right to determine whether applicants for the position possess such qualifications, skills, and abilities.[58]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[57]&#x2003;Exceptions Br. at 22 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i)). The Authority reviews questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo. NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In conducting <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Loc. 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings unless the excepting party establishes that they are nonfacts. <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, Brownsville, Tex</span>., 67 FLRA 688, 690 (2014) (<span class="Italic">CBP</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 57 FLRA 36, 39 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, N.Y. State Council</span>, 45 FLRA 17, 20 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>),[59] the Authority applies a three-step test to determine whether an award or remedy excessively interferes with a management right. However, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> applies only where the award or remedy affects the specified management right.[60]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;70 FLRA 398, 405-06 (2018) (then-Member DuBester dissenting). Under <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> three-step framework, the first question is whether the arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405. If so, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the answer to the second question is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the answer to that question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 406.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Logistics Agency</span>, 70 FLRA 932, 933 (2018) (<span class="Italic">DOD</span>) (then-Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency's argument involves alleged effects on the already completed selection process for the disputed position, the Arbitrator found that the candidates for that position were not properly ranked--a finding to which we defer because the Agency has not alleged, let alone shown, that it is a nonfact.[62] Thus, any effects on the previous selection process do not implicate &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i), which concerns selections from "properly ranked" candidates only.[63]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Agency argues that by enforcing the Agency's own conflict-of-interest rules--which required the interviewers and selecting official to recuse themselves from any selection actions involving business associates--the Arbitrator "refus[ed] to let management use supervisors...who have at any time worked with or supervised any of the applicants for a position." But this argument misrepresents the award,[65] which held only that individuals who had worked with an applicant for an extended period of time were the applicant's business associates and, as such, must recuse themselves from selection actions involving that applicant. More significantly, the Agency fails to establish how enforcing conflict-of-interest rules for interviewers and a selecting official affects the right to determine the qualifications, skills, and abilities needed to perform the work of a position or the right to determine whether <span id="page_2024"></span>applicants for a position possess such qualifications, skills, and abilities.[67] Thus, we deny this argument.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency contends that the remedy of priority consideration excessively interferes with management's &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i) right because "management is effectively prevented from hiring the best qualified applicant for upcoming supervisory positions for which [the g]rievant might be at least minimally qualified." In other words, the Agency contends that "[m]anagement would be required to promote [the g]rievant to a supervisory position, regardless of his qualifications." Under the three-step DOJ framework, the first question asks whether the arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision, and the second question asks whether the remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation.[70] But the Agency "assume[s]" for the sake of its excessive-interference argument that the answers to the first and second questions are both yes.[71] Therefore, we focus on the final DOJ question--whether the remedy excessively interferes with management's &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i) right.[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[72]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In describing the effects of the challenged remedy, the Agency admits that "management could decline to select [the g]rievant for a given supervisory position," notwithstanding his entitlement to priority consideration. But the Agency attempts to temper its admission by asserting that it would be in a "perilous position" if it did not select the grievant for a future vacancy because he could challenge the Agency's action. However, that consequence exists regardless of whether the grievant receives priority consideration. More importantly, the Authority has previously held that priority-consideration remedies do not excessively interfere with management's &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i) right, as long as the candidate with priority consideration is not exempt from the minimum qualifications, skills, and abilities that the Agency establishes for any future vacancies.[75] As the awarded remedy does not relieve the grievant of the obligation to demonstrate that he possesses the minimum qualifications, skills, and abilities for future vacancies,[76] we find that the remedy does not excessively interfere with management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C)(i).</p>

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may enforce a contract article that creates an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to make selections for positions. In <span class="Italic">VA Network 13 and AFGE Local 390</span>, 56 FLRA 647, 649-50 (2000), the grievant was not selected for promotion to one of a group of 16 vacancies filled as a result of a transfer of work within the agency. The negotiated agreement provided that employees would be treated fairly and equitably, without discrimination, and without reprisal for whistleblowing. FLRA sustained an arbitrator's award of a retroactive promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions alleging that an award violates management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Upon finding that the award affects a management right under section 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that "an award that orders an agency to promote a grievant retroactively into a specified position affects management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Keyport, Washington and Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 55 FLRA 884, 887 (1999). Thus, the award affects management's right to select and must be evaluated under the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Prong I</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that Article 16 of the parties' agreement "requires that employees shall be treated fairly and equitably." The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's failure to select the grievant "was discriminatory, unfair, inequitable and contrary to such provisions" of the parties' agreement, and that the decision was a "deliberate intent on the part of [the selecting official] to not hire the grievant for any of the positions for the reason[ ] that he had voiced his opinion to him concerning the amount and type of equipment." Based on the record as a whole, it is clear, and we find, that the Arbitrator found that the Agency's failure to select the grievant violated Article 16, sections 1 and 9....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1 of Article 16 requires the Agency to treat employees "fairly and equitably," and the Arbitrator interpreted the provision to require the Agency to make its selection decision as to the grievant in a fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory manner. The Authority has addressed requirements that an agency take various actions in a "fair and equitable" or similar manner and, as relevant here, has concluded that such requirement constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3258 and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Boston Regional Office</span>, 48 FLRA 232, 237 (1993) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>). Consistent with <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, Article 16, section 1 is enforceable under section 7106(b)(3) and the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated that section satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. In addition, section 9 of Article 16 effectively restates 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Because section 2302(b)(8) is an applicable law enforceable under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated Article 16 also satisfies prong 1 of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Prong II</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator specifically rejected as unsupported the Agency's reasons for failing to select the grievant for a position. In addition, the Arbitrator specifically found that "the rejection of the grievant...was discriminatory, unfair, inequitable, and contrary to...provisions of" the parties' agreement. By finding that the <span class="Italic">rejection</span> of the grievant was improper, the Arbitrator found that the Agency would have selected the grievant if it had acted properly. As such, and as the Agency makes no claim that the grade level of the position ordered by the Arbitrator is incorrect, we conclude that the award properly reconstructs what the Agency would have done if it had not violated the parties' agreement and, therefore, satisfies prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The award does not violate the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized where an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement by failing to select the grievant and, as a failure to select in violation of a contract provision constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, the award satisfies the first requirement of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12</span>, 55 FLRA 1019, 1022-23 (1999). As to the second requirement, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to retroactively promote the grievant and make the grievant whole for lost wages. This remedies the loss in pay suffered by the grievant as a result of the Agency's improper failure to select him and, as such, satisfies the second requirement. As both requirements are satisfied, the award of backpay is not inconsistent with the Back Pay Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The only basis the Arbitrator provides for the promotion part of his award is a portion of the grievant's position description that states that the incumbent will serve as the Alternate Security Officer a couple of times a week. However, the Arbitrator makes no connection between the quoted portion of the position description, the remedy sought in the grievance, and the promotion of the grievant to the Security Officer position he orders. The Arbitrator also provides no discussion of whether the grievant is qualified to perform the duties of the Security Officer position. Consequently, we find the remedy portion of the award deficient because it does not represent a proper reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had there been no violation<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent">A basis for awarding a promotion is that management's selection process violated a contract article or a governing law. Agency regulations may be equated to provisions of law if it is demonstrated that they: affect individual rights and obligations; were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and were issued in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 154, 154-56 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant did not receive fair and equal treatment in her application for a temporary vacancy and directed that she be selected for a GS-13 position for 1 year. For the reasons discussed below, we find the award deficient and set it aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and Arbitrator's Award</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency posted an announcement for a 1-year temporary GS-13 position. The grievant was not selected for the position. She filed a grievance alleging that she had not been given fair and equal consideration for the position and that she was discriminated against based on race and gender.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance was not resolved and was submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;As relevant here, the Arbitrator stated the question before him as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Was there 'preselection' by the employer in [the selectee's] appointment to the GS 301-13, Job No. 99D180DW Job Announcement?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Award at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that there was preselection as well as favoritism towards the selectee on the part of the grievant's immediate supervisor, and that the grievant did not receive fair and equal treatment on her job bid. In this regard, the Arbitrator cited an Agency regulation, MICOM 690-28.11, which provides at &#x00A7; 4.f. that officials "must avoid practices which would indicate that any person was preselected for a position filled under competitive promotion procedures, or that a promotion was based on <span class="Italic">favoritism</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 6 (emphasis added by arbitrator). Based on testimony, the Arbitrator found that it was "obvious that [the supervisor] was possibly pruning [the selectee] for a GS-13 appointment" by giving him high-level assignments. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, citing MICOM 690-12.5.B(1), the Arbitrator stated that "[t]here appear[ed] to be a duty" on the part of the supervisor to announce vacancies within his own department and to announce the filling of such vacancies<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Arbitrator found that the supervisor did not announce either the vacancy or its filling to the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, while stating that he was not questioning the selectee's qualifications, the Arbitrator found that "[u]nder the circumstances there are irregularities on how the appointment was made that certainly paint[ ] a picture of favoritism and preselection on [the supervisor's] part." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As a remedy, the Arbitrator awarded the grievant a GS-301-13 job rating for a period of 1 year, and directed that she commence her employment at that level no later than January 3, 2003, or at such time as the parties may mutually agree to begin.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 151-54. Upon finding that an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an award requiring an agency to make an actual selection for an appointment affects management's right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA 1227, 1235 (1998) (Authority held that an award which placed the grievant in a position affected management's right to select); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div., Keyport, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 884, 887 (1999) (Authority found that an award ordering retroactive promotion of the grievant into a specified position affected management's right to select). Here, the award orders the Agency to place the grievant in a GS-13 position for 1 year. Consequently, the award affects management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>analysis, we further find that the award fails to satisfy prong I because there is no evidence or assertion that the Arbitrator found a violation of either applicable law or a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Although the Arbitrator cited two Agency regulations, he made no express finding that the Agency's action violated either regulation. Therefore, the Arbitrator's citation of the two Agency regulations does not satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP. See United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Northampton, Mass.</span>, 53 FLRA 1743, 1746 (1998) (Authority found that award did not satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>where the arbitrator found "defects" in the agency's rating process but did not explicitly link his findings with the violation of any law or contract provision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the Arbitrator implicitly found a violation of either or both of the Agency's regulations, there is no evidence or assertion that either regulation constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. The Union states, without elaboration, that MICOM 690-28 and another Agency regulation not addressed by the Arbitrator were "taken from 5 [C.F.R.] 335." This claim does not assert, let alone demonstrate, that the Agency regulations constitute applicable laws. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the Agency regulations constitute "applicable laws" under the criteria established by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that a regulation is an "applicable law" where that regulation has "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 391-92 <span id="page_2026"></span>(1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Regulations are found to have the force and effect of law when they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 392-93. There is no basis in the record on which to conclude that MICOM 690-28.11 or 690-12.5 satisfies these requirements<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Signal Ctr. &#x0026; Ft. Gordon, Ft. Gordon, Ga.</span>, 58 FLRA 511, 514 (2003) (Member Pope concurring) (Authority set aside an award which failed to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>because, in relevant part, there was no assertion or factual finding to show that the award was enforcing any law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that although the Union claims in its opposition that the award was enforcing provisions of the parties' agreement, there is no evidence that this argument was made to the Arbitrator or that the Arbitrator found any violation of the parties' agreement. Therefore, nothing in the record supports a conclusion that the award enforces a collective bargaining agreement provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could enforce an agency's promise to an employee of a promotion following a specified period of service when that promise was within the intent of negotiated provisions of the parties' contract concerning promotion, <span class="Italic">EPA Region 5 and AFGE Local 704</span>, 61 FLRA 247, 249-50 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is inconsistent with law because the Agency's decision to promote is always discretionary. Authority precedent is to the contrary, however. Specifically, an agency may be required to promote an employee at specific times, in situations where the effect of the parties' lawful agreement "is to require the [a]gency to certify an employee for promotion upon the employee's fulfillment of the qualifications for promotion." <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 51 FLRA 1700, 1706 (1996) (<span class="Italic">SSA)</span>; <span class="Italic">see United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Med.

<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, in <span class="Italic">VA, Charleston</span>, the arbitrator determined that a settlement agreement between the parties entitled the grievants to a promotion after one year in grade and achieving successful performance ratings. The Authority upheld the award, finding that, as the grievants had met the promotion requirements, they were entitled to a promotion consistent with the agreement and that the agency violated the agreement by failing to timely promote the grievants. <span class="Italic">See VA, Charleston</span>, 58 FLRA at 415. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2030 </span>and <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> the Authority upheld arbitral findings that the parties' agreements required the agencies to promote grievants to the next higher grade once they satisfied all the requirements for a career ladder promotion. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 2030</span>, 56 FLRA at 673; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 1706. The Authority determined that, having found that the grievants met the "requisite conditions" for promotion, the arbitrators properly concluded that the grievants were entitled to promotions under the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2030,</span> 56 FLRA at 673; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 1706.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is analogous to <span class="Italic">VA, Charleston, NFFE, Local 2030</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA</span>. As noted above, the Agency concedes that there was no legal impediment to promoting the grievant to the GS-11 level after 320 hours of service. In addition, the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement entitled the grievant to be promoted to GS-11 upon completing the required 320 hours of service for the Agency. Specifically, the Arbitrator determined that &#x00A7; 7 and &#x00A7; 2, entitling the grievant to "receive a proper amount of pay at the proper time" and to "achieve the full potential of his career ladder[,]" were violated by the Agency's failure to promote the grievant. The Agency does not dispute the Arbitrator's construction of the parties' agreement or contend that the contractual entitlement to promotion is unenforceable as inconsistent with law. Accordingly, as the parties' agreement entitled the grievant to be promoted and the Agency concedes that it had the legal authority to promote the grievant, the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See VA, Charleston</span>, 58 FLRA at 415; <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2030,</span> 56 FLRA at 673; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 51 FLRA at 1706.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's assertion that the award is contrary to <span class="Italic">Kizas, Applegate, </span>and <span class="Italic">Butler</span> because the Arbitrator improperly applied the doctrine of detrimental reliance provides no basis for finding the award deficient. In this connection, the Arbitrator's finding regarding the detrimental reliance doctrine was an alternative finding to his conclusion that the grievant was entitled to a promotion under the parties' agreement. In addition, in <span class="Italic">Kizas, Applegate,</span> and <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, the agencies were prohibited by law or regulation from promoting employees or providing them with special preferences. Here, as found by the Arbitrator and conceded by the Agency, "there were no legal impediments" to the Agency promoting the grievant to the GS-11 level after he completed 320 hours of work for the Agency. Thus, while the doctrine of detrimental reliance does not apply against the Federal government, what that means for this case is that contractual entitlements to promotion are enforceable subject to being legal. And, as noted, there were no legal impediments to this particular promotion action. Accordingly, the Agency's reliance on the cited decisions is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the process of reviewing a promotion action, the arbitrator may not rewrite management's selection criteria. FLRA reviewed its guidance applicable to arbitrators' awards involving merit promotion in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 31 and VAMC, Cleveland</span>, 49 FLRA 957, 961-64 (1994), as it set aside an award directing management to select the grievant for a supervisory position filled through competitive procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides that management has the right in filling positions to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. An arbitrator may, consistent with an agency's right to make selections under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute, properly award a grievant a promotion in circumstances where the award results from enforcement of a contractual arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-17 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>). An arbitrator also may properly order an agency to select or promote an employee when the arbitrator determines that the employee was affected by improper agency action that directly resulted in the failure of the employee to be promoted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Family Support Administration, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Local 250</span>, 42 FLRA 347, 356 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Family Support Administration</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Regional Office, Waco, Texas and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2571</span>, 41 FLRA 681, 685 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record before us in this case, we conclude that the award ordering the grievant retroactively promoted does not constitute the enforcement of, or the remedy for a violation of, an arrangement in the parties' master or supplemental agreements within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, San Juan, Puerto Rico and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2608</span>, 46 FLRA 1134, 1142 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA, San Juan</span>) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> did not apply because there was no evidence that the arbitrator enforced an arrangement); <span class="Italic">Family Support Administration</span>, 42 FLRA at 357 (award ordering grievant promoted retroactively did not constitute the enforcement of, or the remedy for a violation of, a specific provision of the parties' agreement within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). Although the Arbitrator quoted various provisions of the parties' agreements, including portions of Article 34 of the parties' master agreement and Article XII of the parties' supplemental agreement, it is not apparent that those agreement provisions constitute arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to make selections for positions. In particular, we note that Article 34, Section 1 of the master agreement provides only that the purpose of the placement procedures is to locate the best-qualified candidates for vacant positions. There is nothing in that provision or in the remainder of the portion of Article 34 quoted by the Arbitrator that constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to select for positions under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, it is not apparent that the Arbitrator enforced any provision in Article XII of the parties' supplemental agreement that constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to select. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense, National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard Bureau, Washington Army National Guard, Tacoma</span>, <span class="Italic">Washington and National Association of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Sub-Local R12-122</span>, 45 FLRA 782, 788 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> did not apply where it was not apparent that provision of a collective bargaining agreement enforced by an arbitrator constituted an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right). Further, we note that neither the parties nor the Arbitrator referred to provisions of the parties' agreements as being appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Austin, Texas and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 219</span>, 40 FLRA 1035, 1042 n.1 (1991). Consequently, in the absence of the Arbitrator's enforcement of a contractual arrangement, we need not apply the test set forth in <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we address the Agency's contentions that the award is inconsistent with management's right under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute to select employees because the Arbitrator interfered with management's rights to determine the qualifications of positions and to select a qualified candidate for a position. As noted above, section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides that management has the right to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion. In our view, the Agency has established that the award conflicts with management's right to determine the qualifications of the supervisory kinesiotherapist position and to select a properly ranked and certified applicant based on those qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's determination of the relative weights <span id="page_2027"></span>and values assigned to the four selective factors and made her own determination that the position required experience in kinesiotherapy rather than managerial and administrative experience. On that basis, she determined that the grievant was more qualified than the selectee and that the grievant should have been selected. The Arbitrator made no finding that the selectee was not qualified for the position, but found only that he was not the most qualified applicant when applying the selective factors as interpreted by the Arbitrator. We conclude that the Arbitrator's changing of the relative weights of the four selective factors from the weights assigned by management directly interfered with management's right to determine the qualifications for the position and to make a selection from a group of properly qualified applicants pursuant to section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Association of Civilian Technicians, New York</span> <span class="Italic">State Council and U.S. Department of Defense, National Guard</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau, State of New York, Division of Military and Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs</span>, 45 FLRA 17, 20 (1992) (proposal which limited management's right to determine qualification requirements for a civilian national guard position directly interfered with management's right to select under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region and American Federation of Government Employees, Council 147</span>, 48 FLRA 293, 301 (1993) (agency failed to establish that award interfered with management's right to determine qualifications for positions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that when an arbitrator is not enforcing an arrangement, such as in this case, management's right to select employees for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when the arbitrator finds a direct connection between improper agency action and the agency's failure to select a specific employee for promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 242</span>, 45 FLRA 437, 443 (1992). In addition, we approach awards of promotions by arbitrators in relation to section 7106(a)(2)(C) in the same manner as awards of retroactive promotions with backpay by arbitrators under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator specified no provision of law or the parties' collective bargaining agreement that required the Agency to give more weight to experience in kinesiotherapy or prohibited the Agency from placing greater emphasis on managerial and administrative skills than on kinesiotherapy experience as a basis for its selection to fill a supervisory position. The Arbitrator expressly found that there was no evidence of discrimination or preselection as alleged by the Union in the grievance. Although the Arbitrator held generally that the Agency failed to show that it had selected the most qualified applicant as required by law and the parties' agreement, the specific ground on which the Arbitrator found that the grievant was entitled to a promotion was her finding that the Agency should have used technical experience and ability in kinesiotherapy as the primary qualification for the supervisory position instead of managerial and supervisory experience and ability. For that reason, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was better qualified than the selectee and should have been selected. We conclude that the Arbitrator has not set forth a sufficient basis on which to justify an order directing that the grievant be selected for the position. <span class="Italic">See SSA, San Juan</span>, 46 FLRA at 1143 (arbitrator failed to set forth a sufficient basis on which to order a grievant selected for a position).</p>
