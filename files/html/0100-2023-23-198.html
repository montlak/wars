<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-193"><span class="space">a.</span> Reasonableness of Timing of Enforcement; Laches Defense</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is no certification of compliance, a determination must be made of the timeliness of an enforcement petition. The Board's regulation calls for the enforcement petition to be filed "promptly," a term subject to circumstantial evaluation and application. The agency may contend that the delay in the initiation of the enforcement proceedings is so great that it cannot defend <span id="Page_5055"></span>itself due to loss of records or inability to find witnesses with knowledge of the underlying events. The Board then considers the agency defense under the rubric of laches, although the analysis is intermixed with the question of whether the enforcement petition was filed within a reasonable time or, as stated in the regulation, "promptly."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Poett v. MSPB</span>, 360 F.3d 1377, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2004), emphasized two factors relating to the timeliness of an enforcement petition when an agency has not certified compliance. First, the appellant need not act upon suspicion of a breach--in <span class="Italic">Poett</span>, a belief that the agency may have provided a bad reference; instead, the appellant may await actual knowledge of the breach before initiating enforcement proceedings based upon a breach of the settlement. Second, assuming no certification of compliance by the agency, the reasonableness of the appellant's delay in initiating enforcement proceedings will be based on evaluation of specific circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "reasonable time" requirement for filing a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement is conceptually similar to the defense of laches. To invoke laches, a defendant has to show two facts: 1) the plaintiff delayed filing suit for an unreasonable and inexcusable length of time from the time he knew or reasonably should have known of his claim against the defendant; and 2) the delay operated to the prejudice or injury of the defendant<span class="Italic">. See A.C Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Const</span>r. Co., 960 F.2d 1020, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In either case, unreasonable delay is needed. In a case where a party agrees to abstain from certain conduct, it is proper to require actual knowledge of the alleged breach of that agreement before starting the reasonable time period for filing a petition for enforcement of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. MSPB</span>, 844 F.3d 1340, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (Judge Newman dissenting) (14 year delay in enforcement: "Given that the Agreement specifically provided that Gallegos 'will notify the Agency of any concerns within 15-days of receipt of the [revised SF-50] form,' we find no error in the Board's conclusion that Gallegos did not exercise due diligence. '[w]hether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion and this court will not substitute its own judgment for that of the Board.' <span class="Italic">Mendoza v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>.<span class="Italic"> A.C. Aukerman Co. v. R.L. Chaides Constr. Co.,</span> 960 F.2d 1020, 1037-41 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (discussion of laches in a patent dispute).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The suggestion in <span class="Italic">Poett</span> that a laches analysis, requiring a showing of defense prejudice, should be applied to an arguably belated enforcement petition was rejected in <span class="Italic">Kieffer v. MSPB</span>, 263 Fed. Appx. 881, 883-85 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), applying the more traditional approach measuring the timeliness of the enforcement petition from the date the appellant knew of the breach of the settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unless the contract provides a time limit within which the parties must bring an enforcement action, a petition for enforcement must be filed "within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach." <span class="Italic">Poett v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 360 F.3d 1377, 1380-81 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citation omitted). This court requires "actual knowledge" to trigger the time limit to file a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1384. The reasonableness of a delay depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">See Kasarsky v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 296 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kieffer asserts that he filed his petition for enforcement within a reasonable time. According to Mr. Kieffer, he did not have actual knowledge until March 5, 2005, the effective date of his removal. Before that date, the BIA's actions were merely anticipatory and did not violate the terms of the settlement agreement. In particular, the June 16, 2004, proposal letter was an anticipatory breach because the BIA could have decided not to sustain the removal action. And a mere threat of a breach is not sufficient to trigger the Petitioner's obligation to timely file a petition for enforcement. Thus, according to Mr. Kieffer, four months passed between the date on which he had actual knowledge of the alleged breach and the date on which he filed his petition. Mr. Kieffer argues that his pursuit of an appeal of the removal justified the four-month delay. Further, between the date of the proposal letter and the date on which he filed the petition, Mr. Kieffer informally attempted to dissuade the BIA from taking final action, specifically in a letter dated September 29, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kieffer also urges this court to consider a new factor in evaluating the reasonableness in a delay in bringing an enforcement action. He cites language from this court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Poett,</span> which discussed the doctrine of laches in its reasonableness analysis. Mr. Kieffer suggests that this discussion makes a delay reasonable unless it prejudices the opposing party. Because the BIA knew that Mr. Kieffer was appealing the removal during the four months between the effective date of his removal and his filing the petition for enforcement, he argues that the BIA could not have been prejudiced. However, Mr. Kieffer suggests that had he explored an alternative administrative remedy during that time, as opposed to appealing to the Board, the four-month delay may have been unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kieffer does not show that the Board's decision was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. The Board based its conclusion on two clocks, each triggered by a different alleged breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board concluded that the June 16, 2004 notice of proposed removal provided the first alleged breach, because the document informed him that the issues related to his 60-day suspension were not resolved. This first alleged breach was not anticipatory because it allegedly violated the first paragraph of the settlement agreement, which purports to resolve "all issues and controversies relating to" Mr. Kieffer's suspension appeal. The notice of proposed removal reignited a controversy between the parties concerning issues related to Mr. Kieffer's prior misconduct because the BIA's decision that Mr. Kieffer could no longer perform the essential functions of his position was based on the U.S. Attorney's Office's advice. Thus, the notice of proposed removal amounts to the alleged contractual nonperformance. In his petition for enforcement, Mr. Kieffer effectively agreed, stating that the BIA "is in breach...in that it proposed and sustained the removal...." Mr. Kieffer did not limit his breach allegation to the BIA's sustaining the removal. The Board was correct to deny review of the Administrative Judge's finding that the notice of proposed removal started the clock for Mr. Kieffer to file his petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court finds that the Board did not err in denying review of the determination that the nine-month delay between Mr. Kieffer's receiving the June 16, 2004 notice of proposed removal and filing a petition for enforcement was unreasonable. Mr. Kieffer was represented by counsel throughout the process. In fact, the same counsel represented Mr. Kieffer in his appeal, his petition for enforcement, and in his attempt to dissuade the BIA from taking final action. Although Mr. Kieffer informally attempted to dissuade the BIA from taking final action, the Board has consistently held that pursuit of an alternative resolution with an agency does not constitute good cause for an untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 366, 371 (2006); <span class="Italic">Schrum v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 103, 107 (1989); <span class="Italic">Maples v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 667, 671 (1986); <span class="Italic">Shrider v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 238, 240 (1985); <span class="Italic">Couvillion v. Department of the Army</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 163, 164 (1984); <span class="Italic">Wall v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 139, 140 (1982); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Navy</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 541, 543 (1980). This principle is equally valid in the context of delaying filing a petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Administrative Judge concluded that the June 16, 2004 and September 14, 2004 notice letters provided the second alleged breach, because the notice letters informed Mr. Kieffer that the BIA had disclosed his personnel file to the U.S. Attorney's Office. This disclosure allegedly violated the confidentiality provision in paragraph six of the settlement agreement because the personnel file allegedly contained documents related to Mr. Kieffer's appeal and to the settlement agreement. Again, in his petition for enforcement, Mr. Kieffer identified this disclosure as an alleged breach, stating the BIA "is in further breach...in that [it] communicated the contents of the decision letter with the U.S. Attorney's Office in direct contravention of paragraph number 6 of the settlement agreement." Yet, in his appellate brief, Mr. Kieffer offers no explanation for why this six- to nine-month delay was reasonable. This ground alone was sufficient for the Board to deny review of the Administrative Judge's finding that the delay was unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Kieffer mischaracterizes this court's holding in <span class="Italic">Poett.</span> In <span class="Italic">Poett</span>, this court reasoned that "[t]he reasonable time requirement for filing a petition for enforcement is conceptually similar to the defense of laches.... In either case, unreasonable delay is needed." 360 F.3d at 1384 (citation omitted). This court did not hold in <span class="Italic">Poett</span> that prejudice to the opposing party is a factor in the reasonableness inquiry.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pueschel v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 113 MSPR 422, 425-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-13, 2010 MSPB 53 (2010), examined a laches defense to an enforcement petition and remanded the case for evaluation of the merits of the petition. The agency failed to establish the defense. It failed to demonstrate the unavailability of witnesses or otherwise show substantial harm to its ability to defend the claim, in part a legal issue, raised in the appellant's petition to secure interpretation and enforcement of a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time that the Board issued its decision reversing the appellant's removal, the Board's regulations did not contain a time limit for filing a petition for enforcement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.181(a) (1983). To determine the timeliness of a petition for enforcement under that regulation, the Board applied the doctrine of laches. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wooten v. U.S. Government Printing Office,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 425, 426 (1984). The equitable defense of laches bars an action when an unreasonable delay in bringing the action has prejudiced the party against whom the action is taken. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Social Security Administration v. Carr,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 330 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The party asserting laches must prove both unreasonable <span id="Page_5056"></span>delay and prejudice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Nuss v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 974 F.2d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 957 F.2d 861, 863 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Pepper v. United States,</span> 794 F.2d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency demonstrated that it was prejudiced by the appellant's delay in filing her petition for enforcement. Based on the sworn declarations of agency employees, three of whom had specific involvement in the settlement matter, the administrative judge found that "the current employees who had some involvement in the settlement agreement and back pay calculation no longer have specific recollections of the matter, and there is no evidence that other witnesses are available." Ms. McCarthy, who has been the agency's representative in matters involving the appellant since approximately 1994, declared that, of the two payroll personnel who were involved in implementing the appellant's restoration to duty, Zelda Cook had retired and Linda Krause could not be found. Ms. McCarthy further declared that Diane Liff, who was a signatory to the settlement agreement and still works for the agency, had not returned her telephone message, but Ms. McCarthy opined that "it would be unlikely that Ms. Liff would [have been] involved in implementation of the Board's order or the settlement agreement." James Whitlow, who was involved in negotiating the settlement agreement on behalf of the agency, declared that he had "no specific recollection of the details of the negotiations" and that he "would not have been involved in [the] implementation" of the agreement. Aaron Rappaport, who, in his capacity as a Supervisory Personnel Management Specialist "dealt with some issues regarding implementation of the settlement agreement," declared that he had "no specific recollection of any events and issues connected to the implementation of the agreement," that he "[did] not recall the names of anyone else involved in this matter," and, that he "was unable to refresh [his] recollection of any issues relating to the implementation of the settlement agreement and would not be able to articulate the Agency's position or reasoning with respect to those issues." Lastly, Margaret Gilligan, who, as a staff attorney, "dealt with some issues regarding implementation of the settlement agreement," declared that she had a "vague recollection that there were issues with respect to the implementation of the settlement agreement" but that she now has "no specific recollection of those issues, and would not be able to articulate the Agency's position with respect to those issues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to Ms. Cook, her alleged retirement does not establish her unavailability, and the record does not reflect that the agency made any attempt to find her. <span class="Italic">See Nuss,</span> 974 F.2d at 1319 (a claim that a witness has retired does not establish that the witness is unavailable); <span class="Italic">Hoover</span>, 957 F.2d at 864 ("It is the availability and memory of witnesses, not their employment status, that is relevant."). With regard to Ms. Krause, who, in her capacity as the Manager of the Payroll Branch signed the March 1984 letter that transmitted the back pay computations to the appellant, the record does not reflect that, after the agency's current Payroll Liaison Staff Point of Contact told Ms. McCarthy that she had never heard of Ms. Krause, Ms. McCarthy made any further attempt to find the witness. With regard to Ms. Ziff, who is still employed by the agency, Ms. McCarthy merely left a voice mail message which was not returned. Ms. McCarthy's declaration does not reflect any significant effort to locate these three witnesses and is therefore insufficient to establish their unavailability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Whitlow asserted that his memory has faded, he was not involved in implementing the settlement agreement; thus, the agency has not shown how his inability to recall any issues regarding its implementation prejudiced the agency. Mr. Rappaport and Ms. Gilligan were involved in implementing the settlement agreement, but they both asserted that they had "no specific recollection" regarding its implementation and "would not be able to articulate the Agency's position" with respect to any issues involved in its implementation. Nevertheless, even if the agency established that those witnesses' unavailability or lack of memory prejudiced its ability to defend against the appellant's claim, the unavailability of some witnesses does not show prejudice if other witnesses are available. <span class="Italic">See Nuss,</span> 974 F.2d at 1318. The appellant's sworn declaration below asserted that three other individuals involved in the matter, Patricia Healey, Pat Carey, and Heather Biblow, are still employed by the agency and presumably are available to testify. Further, the appellant asserts that Ms. Healey, "a Human Resource Specialist in the [FAA's] Eastern Region--was involved in the processing of [her] time and attendance information for [her] OWCP claims," and Ms. Carey, also a Human Resource Specialist "was responsible for calculating [her] OWCP leave." Ms. Healey and Ms. Carey would therefore appear to be able to provide important testimony on the appellant's claim, that OWCP's acceptance of her injury claim had effectively transformed the back pay into non-taxable compensation. The agency, which bears the burden of establishing prejudice, failed to rebut the appellant's assertions regarding the availability of Ms. Healey and Ms. Carey. <span class="Italic">See Hoover,</span> 957 F.2d at 864.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the agency's missing witnesses are irrelevant and immaterial to her petition for enforcement, because "the legal question of whether all or part of the [appellant's] back pay should be classified as OWCP compensation rather than back pay...does not require witness testimony by [the] employees involved in the original calculations...." The appellant asserts that those witnesses' testimony is not needed because "neither the accuracy of the calculations nor the reasoning behind the calculations is being challenged." The appellant explains that, instead, "the issue is whether the Agency should be required to reclassify the amounts paid to Appellant (e.g., the restoration of federal income taxes, which are not paid on OWCP compensation)" including amounts that were withheld from her back pay award. Thus, the appellant asserts, "the testimony of the employees who made the original calculations will shed no light on the issue in this Petition" and "the fact that current Agency employees can no longer recall the specifics of the 1983 settlement agreement...is also irrelevant." The administrative judge disagreed, stating that "[i]f the 'legal question' is answered in the affirmative, then it would be very important to know how the appellant's back pay was calculated in order to determine what portion of it, if any, should be OWCP compensation." The administrative judge also commented that "it would be inappropriate at this early stage of the adjudication to presuppose that the agency could adequately defend against the enforcement petition without witnesses." However, as noted above, the appellant asserted without rebuttal that other witnesses are available, and that two of those available witnesses, Ms. Healey and Ms. Carey, may have specific knowledge of the appellant's OWCP claim. Further, the agency bears the burden of establishing prejudice, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Hoover,</span> 957 F.2d at 864, and the administrative judge's comment about the inappropriateness of presupposing that the agency could defend itself without witnesses indicates that she may have improperly placed the burden on the appellant to show that she could prove her claim on the available documents rather than placing the burden on the agency to establish prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's discussion of the documents already in the record also indicates that she may have improperly placed the burden on the appellant to show that she could prove her claim on those documents alone rather than requiring the agency to establish that the inadequacy of the available documents prejudiced its ability to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> RID at 7 ("After reviewing these documents identified by the appellant as 'available evidence' of her back pay calculation, I find that they create more confusion than they resolve and they convince me of the necessity for more reliable evidence."). Further, the administrative judge gave short shrift to the appellant's sworn declaration that the payroll and leave records necessary to adjudicate her petition for enforcement are still available from the Department of the Interior, which processes payroll for the FAA. As noted above, the agency's specific back pay calculations are a part of the record, including the amount of base pay at issue and the amount of taxes that were taken out.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The administrative judge observed that "[b]ecause the appellant's back pay appears to have been calculated pursuant to the settlement agreement and not the Board['s] decision, it is unclear how the Board could address the back pay calculation in an enforcement petition." However, our reviewing court has recognized that a settlement agreement, like the one in this matter, which the parties intended to be a full and complete settlement of a case, including all other issues pertaining to that case, does not foreclose a subsequent claim based on a separate substantive right, even if both claims arise out of the same set of facts. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mays v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 995 F.2d 1056, 1060 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("claims based on different laws giving rise to separate substantive rights were not mutually foreclosed by settlement of one of them, notwithstanding their common factual bases"). The appellant's right to appeal her removal under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and her right to file a petition for enforcement of a final Board order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a) appear to be such separate substantive rights. Importantly, nothing in the settlement agreement explicitly waives the appellant's right to file a petition for enforcement or appears to represent the sort of knowing and voluntary waiver that the Board requires in order for a settlement agreement to waive an appellant's rights. <span class="Italic">See generally McCall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 839 F.2d 664, 666-67 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (a knowing and voluntary waiver of appeal rights in a settlement agreement is not void as a matter of public policy).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the administrative judge's discussion focused on the availability of documents from the agency's litigation files, not on the payment, payroll, and leave records described above, records that appear to be more relevant to the issue presented, which is the proper classification of the appellant's back pay award. Regarding the litigation files, the administrative judge found, based on the declaration of agency Legal Technician Maryann Migone, that the litigation files regarding this matter had been held for two years by the agency, transferred to the Federal Records Center, retained for the required period, and then <span id="Page_5057"></span>destroyed. Based on Ms. Migone's declaration, the administrative judge found that, "[b]ecause the litigation files were destroyed pursuant to a disposal schedule...their destruction was the result of the filing delay." However, the record is devoid of any information as to when those documents were actually destroyed, and the destruction of documents pursuant to a disposal schedule is insufficient to establish that the destruction was the result of the appellant's delay. <span class="Italic">See Nuss,</span> 974 F.2d at 1319 (the loss of relevant documents pursuant to the destruction of the appellant's personnel file shortly after his retirement was not deemed to be due to the appellant's delay in bringing his claim for enhanced retirement benefits). Further, even if the litigation files were destroyed as a direct result of the appellant's delay in bringing her petition for enforcement, the administrative judge failed to satisfactorily explain how the unavailability of the litigation files prejudiced the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to establish that the unavailability of witnesses or documents prejudiced its ability to defend against the appellant's petition for enforcement. Because the agency did not meet its burden of showing prejudice, we need not reach the issue of the reasonableness of the appellant's delay in bringing her petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hoover,</span> 957 F.2d at 864.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SE-0752-92-0220-X-1 (NP 5/26/2011), declined to apply laches to bar an enforcement petition that sought to rescind a settlement negotiated 17 years earlier when the enforcement proceeding was initiated soon after the appellant discovered a breach of the agreement involving maintenance of documentation of the underlying adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We also find unpersuasive the agency's argument that it will be materially prejudiced by its inability to locate the unidentified individuals who allegedly provided the appellant with confusing information regarding interpretation of the travel regulations. Rather, the absence of witnesses who could testify in support of the appellant's claim that confusing information was responsible for his filing what the agency deemed a fraudulent travel claim would appear to prejudice the appellant more than the agency. Moreover, if the appellant is able to locate these individuals, the agency will have an opportunity to question them during adjudication of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the agency admits that it has been able to locate copies of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service report on which the removal action was based and the management investigation conducted by the proposing official. The record also shows that three of the individuals involved in the appeal, the deciding official, the proposing official, and the agency representative, have some recall of the event, apart from the report. According to the appellant, his former supervisor, who is mentioned in the preaction investigation as an individual with whom the appellant discussed the travel orders at issue, is also available to testify. The fact that some witnesses, such as the individual who conducted the investigation, may be unavailable does not show prejudice if other witnesses are available. <span class="Italic">Nuss v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 974 F.2d 1316, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hare v. NCUA</span>, PH-3443-14-0638-C-1 (NP 5/10/2022), considered (and rejected) an equitable tolling argument, and considered (and rejected) the timeliness under MSPB's regulation of a compliance petition filed well after the agency's notice of compliance in a VEOA case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In certain instances, the Board considers whether to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to a statutory deadline under which the filing period is suspended for equitable reasons. For instance, the Board has considered equitable tolling in individual right of action (IRA) appeals and Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) appeals to determine whether a case should be considered timely filed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Heimberger v. Department of Commerce</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12 (2014) (considering the doctrine of equitable tolling and finding that the appellant did not show a sufficient basis to toll the filing deadline of her IRA appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)); <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2012) (finding that the application of equitable tolling to waive the 60-day period for filing a written complaint with DOL was not appropriate); <span class="Italic">Alegre v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 17 (2012) (remanding a VEOA appeal to consider whether equitable tolling would render the appeal timely when the appellant had not filed his Board appeal within the statutory 15-day deadline after receiving notification from DOL). The Board considers whether to apply equitable tolling in these situations because the statutory basis for the deadlines in these appeals does not provide for waiving the time limit for good cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A), 3330a(a)(2)(A), (d)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Alegre</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 17; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b). Furthermore, these circumstances are limited to situations such as when an employee has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass or when an appellant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period. <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, the Board is considering the appellant's petition for enforcement in a VEOA appeal, as opposed to the VEOA appeal itself, the Board may apply its own regulations, as set forth in chapter II, subchapter A, part 1201 of title 5, to address procedural matters. <span class="Italic">See generally Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 587 F.3d 1310, 1314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Under these regulations, instead of considering equitable tolling, the Board considers whether the appellant's petition was timely filed or whether there was good cause for the delay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if we considered the applicability of the doctrine of equitable tolling, we would find it inapplicable here. The administrative judge informed the appellant of the appropriate deadline for filing a petition for enforcement and there is no evidence that the agency or the administrative judge induced or tricked the appellant regarding the filing deadline. Accordingly, even if we did consider the doctrine of equitable tolling, we would find no basis for waiving the deadline in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant files his petition for enforcement more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied with the Board's decision, he must submit a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and request an extension of time for filing the petition. <span class="Italic">Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 66, 71 (1998); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a); <span class="Italic">see Gallegos v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 844 F.3d 1340, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (affirming the Board's finding that the appellant did not establish good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement). To establish good cause for the untimely filing, the appellant must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine if an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the following: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence; (3) whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>; and (4) whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune that similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Gaetos v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 201, &#x00B6; 5 (2014); <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge properly found, the delay in this case was lengthy. Specifically, the appellant's petition for enforcement was 171 days late and he did not request an extension of time to file his petition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Accordingly, this factor weighs heavily against finding good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 556, &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (finding that a delay of 6 months is not minimal).</p>
