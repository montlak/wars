<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-167"><span class="space">b.</span> Strict Application</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board rule on late petitions for review is strict. An analysis of a PFR slightly delayed through a fax transmission explained, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Price</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PRICE_ELIZABETH_A_CB_7521_00_0015_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248715.pdf">94 MSPR 337</a>, 340-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may grant or deny the waiver of a time limit for filing a petition, in the interest of justice, after considering all the facts and circumstances of a particular case<span class="Italic">. Small [v. GSA]</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 187 &#x00B6; 3; <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 28, 31 (1994). The party whose pleading is untimely has the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness. <span class="Italic">Small,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 187 &#x00B6; 3 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii)) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether a party has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits, or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Winfrey v. National Archives &#x0026; Records Administration,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 403 &#x00B6; 5 (2001).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 113 MSPR 124, 127 &#x00B6; 8, 2010 MSPB 15 (2010), reemphasized that short delays are not readily excused without a showing of good cause:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and that her 11-day delay is not especially lengthy. Nevertheless, the delay is not minimal. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 697, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) (finding 8-day delay not minimal). Moreover, the Board has consistently denied a waiver of the filing deadline even where the delay is not lengthy and the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, if no good reason for an untimely filing is shown. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Scott v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 8 (2008) (finding no good cause for unexplained 11-day delay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cabarloc v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 453, 456 &#x00B6; 10, 2009 MSPB 196 (2009) ("we have consistently denied a waiver of our filing deadline if a good reason for the delay is not shown, even where the delay is minimal and the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>"); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 697, 700 &#x00B6; 11, 2009 MSPB 147 (2009) ("we have consistently denied a waiver of our filing deadline if a good reason for the delay is not shown, even where the delay is minimal and the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>" [eight days]).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board proclaimed in past cases that it is "[i]n the interest of judicial efficiency and fairness, regardless of how minimal the delay," not to waive timeliness requirements without a showing of good cause. <span class="Italic">White v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 320, 322 (1988) (the PFR was about five days late). More recent guidance suggests that "the Board should consider the length of the delay in every good cause determination,"<span class="Italic"> Groesbeck v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 1, 3 &#x00B6; 4, 2008 MSPB 108 (2008), and although the Board shows some latitude toward untimely PFRs in recent years, many untimely filings are still rejected. It is not just lawyers whose lateness goes unexcused; the Board evenhandedly states that "[the] appellant who appears <span class="Italic">pro se</span> may not escape the consequences of any inadequacy in his representation." <span class="Italic">Kolb v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 100, 103 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Harrell v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 281, 284 (1990) (same as <span class="Italic">Kolb</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite occasional changes in Board membership, the rule against untimely PFRs is consistently and strictly applied, although it will be seen in the decisions that follow that short delays are sometimes forgiven--and often short delays are not forgiven. An example of a PFR that was rejected because it was but a day late, despite some extenuating circumstances, is <span class="Italic">Harris v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-10-0086-I-2 (NP 4/8/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review of the May 6, 2010 initial decision that affirmed the agency's decision to reduce her in grade and pay from the position of Supervisory Border Patrol Agent, GS-1896-15, step 7, to the position of Border Patrol Agent, GS-1896-14, step 10, in the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. For the reasons set forth below, we DISMISS the petition as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for the filing delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be timely, a petition for review must be filed within 35 days after the initial decision is issued, or if the appellant shows that she received the initial decision more than 5 days after it was issued, within 30 days of her receipt. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). The appellant bears the burden of proof, by preponderant evidence, with regard to the timeliness of her petition for review. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 4 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The May 6, 2010 initial decision apprised the appellant that the initial decision would become final on June 10, 2010, unless she filed a petition for review by that date or the Board reopens the case on its own motion. The appellant's attorney indicated in a sworn statement that he received it on May 10, 2010. The petition for review was therefore required to be filed 35 days after May 6, 2010, on June 10, 2010. However, the appellant's attorney states, and the record shows, that it was filed on June 11, 2010. The petition was therefore not timely, but was 1 day late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will waive the deadline for a petition for review only upon a showing of good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">Lawson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 5 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.114(f). To establish good cause for an untimely filing, an appellant must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). In determining whether there is good cause, the Board considers the length of the delay, the reasonableness of the excuse and showing of due diligence, whether the appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond her control that affected her ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune that similarly shows a causal relationship to her inability to file a petition in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">See Wyeroski v. Department of Transportation</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 7, &#x00B6; 7, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 253 F. App'x 950 (Fed. Cir. 2007). However, in the interest of judicial efficiency and fairness, regardless of how minimal the delay, the Board will not waive its timeliness requirements in the absence of good cause. <span class="Italic">McDonnell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 400, 402 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. Department of Justice</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 240, 241 (1984) (a petition for review filed 1 day late was not excused where the appellant offered no reasonable excuse for the delay)); <span class="Italic">see also Choco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 638, 640-41 (no good cause for 1-day delay), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 99 F.3d 1159 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, none of the reasons for the 1-day delay in filing the petition for review constitute good cause. In the appellant's attorney's sworn statement, he states that the petition for review was not filed until June 11 because: (1) the petition for review is based on an extensive factual record and the transcripts of the hearing were received by counsel 2 days prior to the filing deadline; (2) the appellant was making attempts to discuss possible settlement of these claims with the agency and has been operating under significant stress; and (3) only some of the electronic filings in this case with respect to the initial appeal are included on the website and some needed to be recreated to assist in filing. The appellant's attorney did not, however, explain why he did not request an extension of time to file the petition for review under these circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant's attorney also filed an untimely reply to the agency's response to her petition for review, in which he addresses both the timeliness issue as well as the merits of the appellant's appeal. Although the appellant failed to show that the substance of this submission was not readily available before the record closed, <span class="Italic">see Adde v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8 n* (2009); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(i), we note that, with respect to the timeliness issue, her representative states therein that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">at the time the decision was filed, Appellant's counsel was not in his office and did not receive the decision until several days later. Part of the reason Appellant's counsel was out of the office was due to the fact that counsel's father suffered a massive, and untimely, terminal stroke, which candidly consumed most of May and June, 2010 and impacted on counsel's schedule. During the period of May and June, counsel was also involved in hearings in federal and state courts in D.C., Virginia, Oregon, and Michigan and in administrative proceedings in Georgia, the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. This heavy calendar, combined with the family illness, consumed much of counsel's time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[C]ounsel was away from his office often during the period, and was distracted by family matters that <span class="Italic">led to an incorrect calculation of the time</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the actual reason for the untimely filing appears to be that the appellant's representative miscalculated the time for filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, the initial decision expressly apprised the appellant that "[t]his initial decision will become final on <span class="Italic">June 10 2010</span>, unless a petition for review is filed by that date...." An error in calendaring a deadline does not constitute the exercise of due diligence or ordinary prudence. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Roush v. Department of the Interior,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 113, 116 (1993) ("An error by the agency's clerical staff does not constitute good cause."); <span class="Italic">Lapedis v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 337, 340 n.2, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 949 F.2d 403 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table) ("The mere fact that the agency miscalculated the time for filing its response...does not establish good cause for the untimely response."); <span class="Italic">Gaff v. Department of Transportation,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 387, 390 n.2 (1990) ("[M]iscalculation of the filing deadline does not constitute good cause...."); <span class="Italic">cf. Jaramillo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2007) (finding that the error of the appellant's representative in recording a refiling deadline <span id="Page_1750"></span>did not establish good cause for the delay in refiling, but waiving the deadline on other grounds in the interest of justice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, although the delay in filing is only 1 day, the appellant is not proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and her attorney has not presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to file the petition in a timely manner or seek an extension of time to file. Accordingly, the appellant has not shown good cause for her delay and there is no basis for granting a waiver. <span class="Italic">See Mendoza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 427, 429, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 918 F.2d 187 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). We therefore dismiss the petition for review as untimely filed without a showing of good cause for the filing delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">No good cause was shown by an attorney who filed one day late but gave no specifics concerning an allegation of delay in the receipt of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 19 MSPR 150, 151-52 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Talas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 99 MSPR 325, 328 &#x00B6; 8 (2005) ("[A]lthough the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and her nine-day delay in filing is not particularly lengthy, we find that it is not minimal."); <span class="Italic">Allen v. OPM</span>, 97 MSPR 665, 667 &#x00B6; 8 (2004) (a delay of 14 days was not minimal); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 92 MSPR 165, 167 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (a delay of approximately 20 days was "not minimal"); <span class="Italic">Rosati v. USPS</span>, 91 MSPR 122, 125 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (two-month delay was not minimal); <span class="Italic">Beck v. GSA</span>, 86 MSPR 489, 493 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (15-day delay was not minimal; the Board reopens the case on its own motion); <span class="Italic">West v. VA</span>, 41 MSPR 121, 123 (1989) (not excusing a one-day delay in the PFR from an initial decision dismissing a petition seeking enforcement of the settlement; the initial decision stated the time limit for the PFR; no cause was given for the delay); <span class="Italic">Mata v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 103, 104 (1988) (one day); <span class="Italic">Ivy v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 350, 351 (1988) (appellant's PFR was rejected as untimely when it was delayed by five days, with the only justification offered being a general complaint about the inadequacy of the first representative). Although appellants are the recipients of more dismissals for belated PFRs than agencies, the Board will preclude an agency PFR, even one filed by OPM in a retirement case, if the late filing is not excused. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Walker v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 398, 399 (2003) (PFR was a month late). The Board refused to entertain an agency PFR filed two days late when no cause for the delay was shown by the agency. <span class="Italic">Droms v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 49, 50, 6 MSPB 53 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit generally adheres to the Board's "strict" rules on timeliness of PFRs, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Olivares v. MSPB</span>, 17 F.3d 386 (Fed. Cir. 1994), although it may occur that the court reverses a Board determination on timeliness, a result reflected by a scattering of decisions in this section. The Federal Circuit criticized the Board for applying an extremely strict standard in cases involving untimely appeals. The court reminded the Board that a minimal delay favored waiver of an untimely filing under <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span> standards. <span class="Italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier the Board elevated procedural error beyond substance through decisions that if the response to an order directing cure of a deficient (lack of a certificate of service) but otherwise timely PFR was late, the appellant must obtain waiver of the late curative filing or the PFR would be considered untimely. <span class="Italic">Franklin v. DHHS</span>, 48 MSPR 133, 135 (1991) (dismissing a PFR refiled three days late; the refiling was necessitated by the lack of a certificate of service on the original PFR); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. VA</span>, 45 MSPR 222, 224 (1990) (same); <span class="Italic">Vazquez v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 16, 18 (1989) (failure to timely supply a certificate of service). In one extreme case, the PFR was filed five days before the deadline, but it lacked a certificate of service. The Board notified the appellant that she had to correct the deficiency within 15 days. On the 16th day the deficiency was corrected, but the Board struck the PFR as untimely. <span class="Italic">Barr v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 66, 68 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The decisions that follow demonstrate that the Board remains reluctant to excuse late submissions. Because appellants are most often the parties petitioning for review, the effect of the Board's strict application of timeliness requirements most often works to their disadvantage. If the Board rejects PFRs on the basis of minor technical deficiencies or minor delays, it ought to at least inform those whose petitions it is about to reject exactly what Board case law requires for the delay to be excused. General recitations to appellants about "good cause" are insufficient to alert them to the rather rigorous demands placed upon them by the cases that follow. For their part, those who file defective petitions should correct them quickly--certainly within the time limit set by the Board--after the defect is made known to them. Once a corrected petition is filed, a party will do well promptly to ensure that it was timely received by the Board and avoid the problem of dismissal because the Board did not receive the corrected PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 56 MSPR 471, 474 (1993) ("The appellant has an affirmative duty to monitor the progress of his appeal, and to ensure that his petition for review is timely filed."), <span class="Italic">on remand</span> from Federal Circuit, 60 MSPR 624 (1994) (PFR was timely filed but misdirected; still sustaining the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects evidence from agencies that seek to justify untimely mailings. If evidence is available but is not forthcoming, an adverse inference seems to be drawn against the explanations offered by the agency for the delay. In <span class="Italic">Sugden v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 144, 147 (1989), despite a plausible explanation concerning the practice of mailing PFRs, the Board concluded that the agency inexcusably failed to provide evidence of "correspondence logs or other records maintained...to assist...in determining when a particular piece of correspondence was mailed." The Board also faulted the agency for its failure to provide information from the Postal Service that might have explained why a piece of franked mail was postmarked, a result that led to the postmark rather than the Board's policy concerning franked (unpostmarked) mail to establish the filing date. The import of the decision is that if a party has any information that might shed light on the date of filing, it should be produced or its absence explained.</p>
