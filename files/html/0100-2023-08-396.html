<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-389"><span class="space">2.</span> Constructive Suitability Determination</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency adopts an OPM suitability determination as its own, a suitability appeal is within Board jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Harpe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0731-11-0186-I-1 (NP 11/15/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not suffer a simple nonselection for a specific position. At the outset, the agency's letter did not just state that the appellant was ineligible for the position, but instead specifically stated that OPM had determined that the appellant was "ineligible for federal employment based upon suitability" until November 7, 2012 (over a year later). Further, OPM's determination expressly stated that not only was the appellant ineligible for federal employment based upon suitability, but also that all his applications and eligibilities were to be cancelled and that he was debarred from competing for or accepting appointments until November 7, 2012. Thus, OPM's determination was an appealable suitability action. <span class="Italic">See Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Riggsbee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 2 (2009) (referring to OPM's cancellation of eligibilities "on existing competitive registers"); <span class="Italic">Sazegari v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 2 (2006) (noting that OPM rated the appellant ineligible for the position of Immigration Inspector and cancelled any other eligibilities he may have obtained). Therefore, the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal, and the appeal must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employing agency terminates an appellant's temporary appointment based on information it receives from an OPM investigation without making a suitability determination, the employee does not have a suitability appeal from the agency action, even though OPM later finds the appellant unsuitable for competitive service employment. <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 316, 319 (1996) (employee could appeal an OPM determination); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 277, 280 (1984) (if the agency acts on an OPM investigation report, due process requires the agency to turn the report over to the appellant during discovery; sanctions are appropriate for failure to produce the report). <span class="Italic">Holland v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/19-1388.Opinion.1-6-2020.pdf">796 Fed. Appx. 1018</a>, 1019-23 (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), emphasized that an agency's reliance on an OPM investigation to terminate an employee for incorrect information in an employment application does not create a suitability action when the agency does not treat the matter as a suitability action (it lacked delegated authority and it did not charge or imply an intent to make a false statement or to deceive or commit fraud) and acts to terminate the employee during a probationary or trial period of a temporary excepted service appointment eligible for conversion to the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before he began working for the DEA in 2017, Mr. Holland served as a local police officer. Between 2009 and 2015, his police department employer issued him three letters of corrective action and three letters of disciplinary action. In May 2016, when Mr. Holland applied to be a special agent with the DEA, he completed an electronic questionnaire as part of the application. The questionnaire asked whether, in the last seven years, he had "received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy." Mr. Holland responded "[n]o."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 9, 2017, the DEA sent Mr. Holland a letter indicating that he had qualified for an interim clearance and offering him a position as a special agent. The letter indicated that Mr. Holland could begin working before the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) completed his background investigation but that he would be removed from the position if "[o]nce the background investigation ha[d] been received and reviewed...any previously unknown or discrepant information [wa] s uncovered that would have had a negative impact on [his] selection." Mr. Holland accepted the offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 14, 2017, Mr. Holland began work as a Special Agent in the DEA "serving under an excepted service appointment" that "may be converted to a career appointment in not less than three years and not more than four years." Mr. Holland's appointment was also subject to a two-year probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM completed Mr. Holland's background investigation on January 3, 2018. While performing the investigation, the OPM investigator learned of the corrective and disciplinary actions taken against Mr. Holland while he was employed as a police officer. In the report based on the "Enhanced Subject Interview," the investigator wrote that Mr. Holland "did not list all of his employment disciplinary actions because he asked a friend if he should list all of the contact cards/disciplinary action[s] and [the] friend told him he was not required to list [them]." The investigator wrote that Mr. Holland "was not trying to hide" the disciplinary actions, which were "common knowledge."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 31, 2018, the DEA terminated Mr. Holland from his position. There had been no notice of proposed removal or an opportunity for Mr. Holland to submit to the deciding official a response to such a proposal. Citing as authority 5 U.S.C. chapter 23 (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301-2306), the termination letter states that the decision was based on Mr. Holland's "failure to provide complete and truthful information in [his] background investigation." The DEA also completed OPM's Standard Forms 50 and 52, which show that Mr. Holland was terminated during the probation/trial period of his excepted-service employment. The initial Standard Forms 50 and 52, approved June 5, 2018, cited legal authority for the termination, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805, different from the authority cited in the termination letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 2018, Mr. Holland appealed his termination to the Board. In early July, the administrative judge assigned to the matter issued orders calling for submissions on the issue of Board jurisdiction. On July 26, 2018, the Department of Justice submitted a letter seeking dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Attached to the letter was a replacement version of Standard Form 52, approved July 26, 2018, changing the authority citation from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.805 to 5 U.S.C. chapter 23, consistent with the termination letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 5, 2018, an administrative judge issued an initial decision holding that the Board lacks jurisdiction to hear Mr. Holland's appeal. The administrative judge explained that Mr. Holland was not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) and that the Board lacked jurisdiction over "constructive suitability determinations." The administrative judge also determined that the Board has no jurisdiction over Mr. Holland's claims that he was subject to a prohibited personnel practice where, as here, there was no otherwise-appealable action. The initial decision became the final Board decision (which we hereafter call it) when the time for full Board review passed without Mr. Holland seeking such review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holland contends that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal under 5 C.F.R. part 731 because his termination was a "suitability action." We disagree, concluding that the DEA did not actually find him unsuitable for the position. The termination decision does not on its face make, and should not be understood as making, such a finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "suitability determination" is "a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority that a person is suitable or is not suitable for employment in covered positions in the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). As relevant here, a "covered position" is "a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In making a suitability determination, OPM or an agency with delegated authority must rest its determination on a ground specified in an exclusive list of permissible bases, of which the only one placed in issue before this court is that the individual involved made a "[m]aterial, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If a suitability determination is made, OPM or an agency with delegated authority may take a suitability action against that person. &#x00A7; 731.203(c). A "suitability action" is a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, or a debarment, &#x00A7; 731.203(a), and "may be taken only by OPM or an agency with delegated authority," &#x00A7; 731.101(b). A person against whom an agency has taken a suitability action may "appeal the action to the...Board." &#x00A7; 731.501(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Mr. Holland was in a "covered position," but appealability would require more--namely, that a suitability action was taken against him. &#x00A7; 731.501(a). But nowhere did the DEA characterize its termination of Mr. Holland as a suitability action or cite the suitability regulations of 5 C.F.R. part 731. The DEA instead cited 5 U.S.C. chapter <span id="Page_766"></span>23 as its legal authority (and, initially, another regulation unrelated to suitability). Further, in a declaration filed before the Board, the DEA's Section Chief for the Suitability Section of Human Resources stated that the "DEA did not perform a suitability review of Cameron Holland or make a negative suitability determination of Cameron Holland" and that OPM "did not issue a negative suitability determination of Cameron Holland."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, Mr. Holland argues that his termination was effectively a suitability action because it rested on a determination that he had made a "[m]aterial, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3). We reject Mr. Holland's recharacterization of his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 731.202(b)(3) requires "intentional" falsity, deception, or fraud, but the DEA, in terminating Mr. Holland, did not find or assert that Mr. Holland had the intent specified in that standard. Whereas the regulation is addressed to a "[m]aterial, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud," &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3), all that the DEA found was that Mr. Holland "fail[ed] to provide complete and truthful information" in [his] background investigation," The declared "failure" does not imply an intent to make a false statement or to deceive or commit fraud. And the record evidence does not indicate that Mr. Holland had such intent but, rather, suggests otherwise, as reflected in the investigator's summary of the interview with Mr. Holland, discussing Mr. Holland's reliance on advice from a friend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Department of Justice agreed at oral argument that the DEA, in terminating Mr. Holland, did not charge him with the "<span class="Italic">mens rea</span>" required by the particular suitability-regulation provision at issue, but was "simply looking at the discrepant information." Oral Argument at 25:25-25:48 ("[Mr. Holland] was terminated for a failure to provide complete and truthful information on his background investigation, so they weren't giving him any sort of <span class="Italic">mens rea</span> of that. They were simply looking at the discrepant information."). The Department added that the statement in the termination letter that Mr. Holland's "conduct is incompatible with the critical duties and responsibilities of a Criminal Investigator," also should not be read to suggest the presence of the intent required by the suitability-regulation provision at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The substantive lack of fit between the suitability-regulation at issue and what the DEA decided is confirmed by the fact that the DEA did not have delegated authority from OPM to make a suitability determination or take a suitability action against Mr. Holland. "OPM [has] retain[ed] jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g). And "[a]gencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority" or notify OPM "if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The DEA did not do so here, which reinforces the conclusion that it was not making a suitability determination or taking a suitability action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Justice asserts an additional ground for concluding that the DEA made no suitability determination and took no suitability action. In 2008, OPM promulgated suitability regulations and, in doing so, recognized that certain agency actions might be subject to being characterized as coming within both the suitability regulation's authority and another source of authority. OPM noted that the Board may not "hold the agency to standards relating to a legal authority that the agency did not invoke." Suitability, Supplementary Information, 73 Fed. Reg. 20,149, 20,152 (Apr. 15, 2008); <span class="Italic">see Upshaw v. Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n</span>, 2009 M.S.P.B. 74, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) ("OPM explained that its new regulations were issued, in part, to correct Board case law which had held that 'what matters is the substance of the action, not the form,' which OPM determined to be erroneous and beyond the intent of Congress."). The Department argues that those comments show that the DEA has plenary power to determine the authority under which it terminates an employee, regardless of whether the termination substantively fits under some other authority that would give the Board jurisdiction it would otherwise lack. But we do not reach that contention, because we reject the applicability of the suitability regulations for the separate, sufficient reason that the DEA did not actually find that Mr. Holland engaged in the intentional conduct to which the suitability-regulation provision at issue is limited.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the suitability regulations, only a "suitability action" may be appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Kazan v.

A "suitability action" is defined as a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, and a debarment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(a). A nonselection for a specific position is not a "suitability action" even where, as here, it is based on the criteria for making a suitability determination as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 9 (2009); <span class="Italic">Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Upshaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's use of the term "Unfavorable Suitability Determination" in its memorandum is inartful, but it does not transform the agency's action into an appealable suitability action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gregory v.
