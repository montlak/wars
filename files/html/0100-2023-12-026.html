<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-27"><span class="space">a.</span> Permissive Subject</h5>
<p class="noindent">The disapproval of a local agreement by an agency head extends only to matters inconsistent with law or government-wide regulation or an agency regulation supported by a compelling need; absent that inconsistency, if the local activity engages in bargaining over permissive matters, the agency is bound by that choice. The D.C. Circuit explained this <span class="Italic">ACT, Montana Air Chap. No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1151-56 (D.C. Cir. 1994), involving the disapproval of a contract clause permitting civilian technicians to wear standard civilian attire in place of a uniform:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act ("FSLMRA" or "Act"), 5 U.S.C. Secs. 7101-35 (1988), which establishes the framework for collective bargaining between federal civil service employees and their respective agencies governs this dispute. Under the Act, agencies are required to "negotiate in good faith" over "conditions of employment," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at Secs. 7114(a)(4), 7102, which include "personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions" but not matters "to the extent [they] are specifically provided for by Federal statute," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at Sec. 7103(a)(14). The Act emphasizes that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to matters "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Sec. 7117(a)(1). Nor does the duty to bargain extend to matters which are the subject of an agency-wide regulation, unless the Authority determines that "no compelling need...exists for the rule or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Sec. 7117(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain language of the statute provides that the agency head "shall" approve an executed agreement "if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, rule, or regulation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). The word "shall" generally indicates a command that admits of no discretion <span id="Page_413"></span>on the part of the person instructed to carry out the directive....&#8197;So here, too, the statute clearly orders that unless the agreement is unlawful or in violation of a rule or regulation, the head of the agency shall approve the agreement and permit it to go into effect. The agency head, then, is not given free reign to prune collective bargaining agreements where local negotiators have come to legally viable arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This common-sense reading of the Act is amply borne out by its legislative history. The agency head approval provision first appeared in the Senate version of the bill and was later added to the House version in conference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 124 CONG. REC. H13,608 (daily ed. Oct. 14, 1978) (remarks by House manager, Rep. Ford), reprinted in Subcommittee on Postal Personnel and Modernization of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 995 (1979) ("LEGISLATIVE HISTORY"); S.2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. &#x00A7; 7219 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 550, 591; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Govt. Employees v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 850, 858 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE"</span>) (discussing legislative history of agency head provision). As the Senate Committee explained, "a substantially identical provision is contained in Executive Order 11491" which was superseded by the FSLMRA, S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 109 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 743, 769.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>the Executive Orders, which until passage of the FSLMRA had regulated labor-management relations in federal employment, "had always made provisions for head of the agency review." <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>778 F.2d at 858 n.12. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exec. Order 11,491, sec. 15, 34 Fed. Reg. 17,605, 17,612 (1969),...Exec. Order 10,988, sec. 7, 27 Fed. Reg. 551, 554 (1962)....&#8197;However, while the first Executive Order regulating federal labor-management relations simply provided that any agreement "must be approved by the head of the agency," Exec. Order 10,988, sec. 7, <span class="Italic">supra, </span>the broad scope of that review was narrowed by Executive Order 11,491, <span class="Italic">"[I]</span> <span class="Italic">n order </span>to pre<span class="Italic">vent 'second guessing' on</span> <span class="Italic">substantive</span> <span class="Italic">issues,</span> the scope of such review was limited to the agreement's conformity with laws, existing published agency policies and regulations, and regulations of appropriate authorities outside the agency." Federal Labor Relations Council, <span class="Italic">Summary of Developments to 1977, reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1160, 1167 (emphasis added). Thus, when local agency negotiators execute a collective bargaining agreement over matters that are permissible subjects of bargaining under the law and current agency policy, their election to negotiate may not be subsequently withdrawn by the agency head. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 124 Cong. Rec. H13,608 (daily ed. Oct. 14, 1978) (statement by Rep. Ford) ("In general, agency negotiators are to be fully empowered to agree to exceptions to agency regulations concerning conditions of employment, including portions of agency regulations supported by compelling need where the need does not apply to the portion of the regulation."), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> LEGISLATIVE HISTORY at 995. This limitation is unambiguously reflected in the language of &#x00A7; 7114(c) itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency head's disapproval of an agreement under &#x00A7; 7114(c), then, is essentially an assertion of nonnegotiability of matters that have erroneously been subjected to collective bargaining. When an agreement is contrary to law or applicable regulation, its execution by local negotiators and the union is irrelevant, since, as the Ninth Circuit observed in <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chapter No. 29, Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Inc. v. FLRA, </span>898 F.2d 753, 759 (9th Cir. 1990),</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[w]hether a provision of the agreement is in accordance with applicable law is not subject to bargaining: either the agreement accords with the law or it does not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employment matters may be classified into three groups: (i) matters that fall within the agency's duty to bargain, (ii) matters outside the agency's duty to bargain but within the permissible realm of collective bargaining, and (iii) matters beyond the lawful scope of bargaining. Numerous courts have held that the dress code for civilian technicians at national guard installations is a means for performing work within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) and therefore a permissible subject of bargaining at the election of the agency. <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, </span>762 F.2d 183 (1st Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">New York Council Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA, </span>757 F.2d 502 (2d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, </span>474 U.S. 846, 106 S. Ct. 137, 88 L. Ed.2d 113 (1985); <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA</span>, 780 F.2d 12 (7th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 2986 v. FLRA, </span>775 F.2d 1022 (9th Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Locals R5-91, R5-107 &#x0026; R5-120 v. FLRA</span>, 771 F.2d 1449 (11th Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>); <span class="Italic">see also American Fed'n of Gov't Employees v. FLRA, </span>864 F.2d 178 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (same for bureau of prisons). While the agency is thus under no obligation to bargain about these dress codes, the agency may elect to negotiate subsection (b)(1) matters as long as this would not violate any other applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency and the FLRA, as noted, advance the additional argument that because the matter of civilian attire pertains not only to a subsection (b)(1) matter but also affects management's enumerated powers under subsection (a)(1), it cannot be the subject of negotiation. As illustrated by our decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 v. FLRA, </span>819 F.2d 306, 308 (D.C. Cir. 1987), this interpretation gets the relationship between subsections (a) and (b) backwards:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Taken alone, [subsection 7106(a)] would relieve an employer from any duty to bargain over union proposals whose incorporation in a collective bargaining agreement would affect the enumerated managerial rights. Subsection 7106(b) of the Act, however, lists certain kinds of proposals that would affect these managerial rights yet remain proper subjects of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">Local 1923 </span>that matters falling under subsection 7106(b)(2), i.e., "procedures which management officials of the agency will observe," and subsection 7106(b)(3), i.e., "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials," invoke the "agency's <span class="Italic">duty</span> to bargain." 819 F.2d at 308 (emphasis added). Section 7106, we held, makes clear that the duty to bargain over matters falling under subsections (b)(2) and (b)(3) exists "notwithstanding that implementation of the proposal would affect the enumerated managerial rights<span class="Italic">." Id. See also American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA, </span>702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983). This relationship between subsections (a) and (b) of &#x00A7; 7106 could not have been expressed more clearly in the language of the Act. The nonnegotiability of management rights enumerated in subsection (a) is expressly "[s]ubject to subsection (b)," and subsection (b) concomitantly provides that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating" matters enumerated in subsection (b). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a) &#x0026; (b). In that sense, we have already decided that &#x00A7; 7106(b) <span class="Italic">is</span> indisputably an exception to 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We know of nothing supporting the conclusion that while matters negotiable under subsection (b)(2) and (b)(3) may pertain to subsection (a), subjects negotiable under subsection (b)(1) may not. Neither the FLRA nor the Agency have pointed to anything in the statute or legislative history that would legitimize so counter-intuitive a reading of the statute. In addition to ignoring &#x00A7; 7106(a)'s self-proclaimed relationship to &#x00A7; 7106(b), the FLRA's reading would render parts--if not all--of subsection (b)(1) nugatory. Subsection (b)(1), for example, permits bargaining about "the numbers...of employees...assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty," while subsection (a) enumerates management rights as including the right "to determine the...number of employees...[and] to assign work." According to the FLRA's interpretation, the number of employees and their assignment would fall beyond the permissible scope of bargaining, despite the explicit authority to bargain set out in subsection (b)(1). The Agency and the FLRA have not presented any reason to accept a logic which would effectively expunge significant passages from subsection (b)(1) of the Act. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Menasche, </span>348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S. Ct. 513, 519-20, 99 L. Ed. 615 (1955) (applying principle of statutory construction "to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute" (internal quotes and citation omitted)). Therefore, we must reject outright the extraordinary twist on simple words proposed by the FLRA's reading of the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While a matter pertaining to subsection (b)(1) is ordinarily not within management's <span class="Italic">duty</span> to bargain, it is not thrust beyond the scope of lawful bargaining simply because it also pertains to management powers enumerated in subsection (a). To be sure, as the FLRA points out, management generally does not waive its reserved rights by voluntarily entering into an agreement about them with a union. And nonnegotiability can ordinarily be asserted as a defense to a charge that the agency has violated the terms of an agreement, notwithstanding the agency's initial failure to reject the proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>778 F.2d at 853-54. But the matter involved here falls under both subsections (a) <span class="Italic">and</span> (b)(1) of &#x00A7; 7106 and so is subject to negotiation at the election of the agency. Once an agreement pertaining to a permissible subject of negotiation is reached by local agency negotiators and a union, this election to negotiate is binding upon the agency. In other words, the agreement cannot subsequently be deemed unlawful by the agency head simply because it pertains to a permissible--rather than mandatory--subject of negotiation. The Act could not be clearer on this point. Since Congress has spoken to the precise issue in question and commanded a result contrary to that arrived at by the FLRA, we grant the petition for review and reverse the FLRA's determination. Of course, the FLRA is free to determine on remand whether the Agency's other asserted reason for disapproving the Agreement, i.e., the existence of an agency-wide rule prescribing the wearing of a uniform, suffices to sustain the agency head's assertion that the dress code was nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span> and the methodology of its application were summarized, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft. Rucker</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 609-10 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span>, the court held that once local agency negotiators and a union reach agreement on a subject covered by section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, the agency head cannot disapprove the agreement on the <span id="Page_414"></span>ground that the subject also is covered by section 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span>, 22 F.3d at 1155-56. Subsequently, the Authority developed a framework for applying the <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span> holding to provisions alleged by the union to be negotiable under section 7106(b)(1) and by the agency to be contrary to law under section 7106(a)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-184 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky</span>, 51 FLRA 386, 393-94 (1995) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">Lexington</span>) (applied to provisions imposing one requirement on management). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1336 and Social Security Administration, Mid-America Program Service Center</span>, 52 FLRA 794, 800-01 (1996) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Mid-America</span>) (applied to provisions imposing two or more inseparable requirements on management), <span class="Italic">petition for review</span> <span class="Italic">withdrawn</span>, No. 97-1066 (D.C. Cir. May 30, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union does not identify the specific provisions believed to be unlawfully disapproved under <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span>. In addition, the Union makes no argument as to how the particular subject matter of any of the provisions falls within the ambit of section 7106(b)(1). The bare assertion that the Agency head's disapproval of the agreement was contrary to <span class="Italic">Montana ACT</span> simply does not provide us with a sufficient basis for applying <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA, Mid-America</span> to the disputed provisions. Accordingly, we review the disputed provisions only on the grounds asserted by the Agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R3-10 and U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 139, 141-42 (1997) (holding that a party advancing a particular legal theory has the burden of creating a record on which that theory can be applied), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed</span>, No. 97-1522 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 25, 1997).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA, Air Route Traffic Control Ctr., Olathe</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-061.html">61 FLRA 336</a>, 338-39 (2005), provides an example of the analysis. At issue was Provision 1, involving negotiations at the local level, requiring that certain shifts be staffed with at least four personnel. The parties agreed to the provision, the agency head sought to disapprove the provision on national level review, and FLRA affirmed the provision by stating that a staffing matter, a matter of permissive bargaining, could not be set aside at the national level because the provision was not contrary to law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that Provision 1 affects its right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The Union does not dispute the Agency's claim that the provision affects that right and, accordingly, we find such an effect. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge #1F</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 384 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Lodge #1F</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of GSA Locals, Council 236</span>, 55 FLRA 449, 452 (1999). The Union does not claim that, notwithstanding its effect on management's right to assign work, the provision is consistent with law because it is a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute or an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Consequently, we do not address &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Union's claim that Provision 1 constitutes a staffing matter under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), we note that longstanding Authority precedent establishes that the number of employees assigned to a tour of duty is a matter pertaining to the Agency's staffing patterns about which the Agency can elect to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NAGE, Branch 11 et al.</span>, 57 FLRA 424, 426-27 (2001)<span class="Italic">.</span> Where an agency has agreed to such a staffing pattern, the agreed-upon provision is in accordance with law under &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute and cannot be disapproved by the agency upon review pursuant to &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 54 FLRA 360, 375 (1998) (<span class="Italic">PTO</span>) ("[I]t is well-established that after parties have reached agreement on a provision encompassing a &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matter, the provision may not be disapproved during agency head review under &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute because such provisions are not contrary to law.") (citing <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-75</span>, 24 FLRA 56, 62 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Local R4-75</span>)).<span class="Italic"> </span>As noted above, it is undisputed that the Agency has agreed to Provision 1. Consequently, its disapproval of the provision is without legal effect. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3732</span>, 39 FLRA 187, 211 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local 3722</span>) (agency is "without authority" under &#x00A7; 7114(c) to disapprove provisions based on an alleged conflict with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's claim that the provision nevertheless affects its right to assign work is unavailing. The Authority has held, in this regard, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 7106(b) is an exception to &#x00A7; 7106(a) such that bargaining over matters encompassed by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) is permitted notwithstanding that such matters also affect rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). This interpretation is consistent with relevant judicial precedent. <span class="Italic">See Montana ACT</span>, 22 F.3d at 1155 ("&#x00A7; 7106(b) is indisputably an exception to &#x00A7; 7106(a)"). Moreover, it is compelled by the plain wording of the Statute, which expressly makes &#x00A7; 7106(a) "subject to" &#x00A7; 7106(b) and provides that "nothing in" &#x00A7; 7106 prevents an agency from electing to bargain over matters encompassed by &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">PTO</span>, 54 FLRA at 374. <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA</span>, 60 FLRA 159, 163-64 (2004) (Authority enforced arbitration award concerning provision prescribing minimum staffing level pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) notwithstanding exception based on management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 393, 395 (2000) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (agreement provisions relating to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matters are enforceable notwithstanding affect on &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, because the Agency elected to bargain and agreed to Provision 1, a staffing matter under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), the provision is consistent with law, notwithstanding its effect on management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). Consequently, the provision cannot be disapproved under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that Provision 1 is consistent with law and will order the Agency to rescind its disapproval of the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA, Air Route Traffic Control Ctr., Olathe</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-061.html">61 FLRA 336</a>, 339-40 (2005) (locally-negotiated Provisions 2 and 3, affecting how supervisors bid for days off), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> pointed out that permissive subject matters of bargaining, for example, conditions of employment of supervisory personnel, are not inherently contrary to law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's claim that the provisions are inconsistent with law because they directly implicate the conditions of employment of supervisory personnel, the Authority has consistently held that such matters are permissive subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3302</span>, 52 FLRA 677, 680-83 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Local 3302</span>); <span class="Italic">IAFF, Local F-61</span>, 3 FLRA 438, 445 (1980). The Authority has also consistently held that contract provisions concerning permissive subjects of bargaining are not inherently contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Local R3-77</span>, 59 FLRA 937, 941 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 56 FLRA at 395-96). Thus, if an agency agrees to a proposal directly implicating the conditions of employment of supervisors, the resulting contract provision cannot be disapproved pursuant to agency head review under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) of the Statute, unless it is otherwise contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1815</span>, 53 FLRA 606, 622-23 (1997). <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Distribution Ctr., New Cumberland, Penn.</span>, 55 FLRA 1303, 1306 (2000) (award enforcing provision directly implicating conditions of employment of supervisors upheld because it was not contrary to law). Consistent with this precedent, the Agency's argument does not demonstrate that the provisions are contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the Agency's claim under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, it is uncontested that the provisions affect management's right to assign work. However, it is also uncontested that the provisions are procedures. In this regard, the Union argued in its Response to the Agency's Statement of Position that the provisions constituted procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). The Agency did not file a reply contesting that claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 2424.32(c)(ii)(2) (failure to respond to an assertion raised by the other party will, where appropriate, be deemed a concession to that assertion). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 219, 222 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 96</span>, 56 FLRA 1033, 1034-35 (2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, a determination that these provisions are procedural in nature is consistent with Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2192</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 870 (2004) (where union asserted proposal negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3), but agency challenged only the &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) claim Authority still made separate finding as to whether proposal was consistent with Authority &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) precedent). Specifically, it is uncontested that the Agency has established the bidding process which is the subject of the provisions so that employees and supervisors may schedule their leave in an orderly manner. Employees take turns, based on seniority, in selecting periods of annual leave; and supervisors do the same, based on some criterion established by management. Such a process is inherently procedural. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local R4-75</span>, 24 FLRA at 56-57 (proposal requiring that conflicts in leave requests be resolved in a procedural sequence from most senior to least senior employee is negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)). <span class="Italic">See also AFGE, Local 1164</span>, 54 FLRA 1327, 1344-46 (1998) (rotational sequence for assigning client interviews does not impermissibly affect right to assign work). In this case, the process involves a series of steps whereby leave schedules are determined based on seniority. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 987</span>, 35 FLRA 265, 270 (1990) ("where management establishes more than one shift during which the same work is performed and the employees have the required qualifications and skills to perform the duties, a proposal concerning which employees will be assigned to various shifts is negotiable" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)). Provisions 2 and 3 merely rearrange the sequence of the steps involved in the procedure, putting the bidding order of supervisors before the bidding order of employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given that the sequence in which employees and supervisors bid on particular leave schedules is procedural within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), even assuming that the bidding process itself constituted a work assignment, that would not, in and of itself, render the provisions outside the duty to bargain. The Authority has consistently held that proposals establishing procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) are negotiable even if some action is required to implement the procedure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 46 FLRA 696, 746 (1992); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 446</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 844-46 (1991);<span class="Italic"> NFFE, Local 2099</span>, 35 FLRA 362, 368 (1990) (procedural proposals that are <span id="Page_415"></span>negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), and that require agency personnel to perform some task in the implementation of the procedure, are within the duty to bargain).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the provisions in no way delay the implementation of the Agency's work schedules. The bidding process takes place well before the work schedules take effect. At most, the provisions delay when employees would submit their bids regarding leave schedules. However, the fact that a proposal or provision may result in some delay in agency action pursuant to its management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) does not in and of itself render the proposal or provision outside the duty to bargain. A proposal or provision that constitutes a procedure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) is negotiable notwithstanding the fact that it may involve some delay in the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 370, 384 (1993) (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of Interior, Bu. of Land Management v.</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1989)).</p>
