All of these individuals would, for different reasons, have an interest in ensuring the agency's success in this appeal."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Eubanks,</span> 76 MSPR 405, 414-16 (1997) (testimony of a victim of sexual harassment was credited as a result of her complaints of the conduct made to others as the conduct occurred).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That self-serving testimony need not be rejected does not mean that testimony not impeached through cross-examination must be credited. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Render v. VA</span>, 90 MSPR 441, 444 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (that the appellant's testimony was in narrative form and not subject to cross-examination did not mean that the AJ was precluded from discrediting it based on baseless charges by the appellant against other agency officials). Despite holdings that testimony is not to be discounted only because it is self-serving, the Board used this reasoning to resolve a credibility dispute without offering any other explanation for its result. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nordell v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 276, 282 (1983). There is no error if an AJ discredits an appellant's testimony as self-serving if the finding is made as part of a more complete analysis of the testimony, inconsistencies, and credibility evaluations. <span class="Italic">Woody v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 547, 549-50 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. USPS</span>, 95 MSPR 493, 498 &#x00B6; 10 (2004) ("Although it was error to reject the appellant's testimony as self-serving...the AJ's credibility determination was otherwise and on the whole consistent with <span class="Italic">Hillen v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Gamble v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 578, 580-81, 6 MSPB 487 (1981), involving a charge of welfare fraud against a postal employee, the testimony of the appellant and his wife contradicted statements they made in affidavits obtained by postal investigators. The appellant explained that he was told by the investigators that if they signed the statements prepared for him and his wife, he would not lose his job. The investigators denied that the statements were obtained through coercion or false pretenses. The AJ discredited the appellant's testimony because it was self-serving and contradicted by his earlier sworn statement. In its review the Board determined that the AJ's analysis was logically deficient, stating that "[m]ost testimony is self-serving to some degree, and we think that an investigator would have a substantial interest in rebutting any claim that he had used improper methods to obtain a confession."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One factor in determining credibility is whether the witness is biased. "While bias is an important factor, it is only one part of a credibility determination." <span class="Italic">Mays v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3241). A particular employment status does not imply bias. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 672 (1997), suggested that "skills such as managerial ability have little bearing on a witness's credibility." If there is evidence that a witness referred to the appellant in disparaging, racially biased terms, the AJ should specifically assess the existence and weight of those remarks to determine the bias of the witness and the effect of that bias on his credibility. <span class="Italic">Chin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 44 MSPR 201, 204 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Edmond v. TVA</span>, 23 MSPR 489, 491 (1984) (AJ should have permitted testimony offered to show that the proposing official falsely charged the appellant because of a supervisor's dislike of the appellant); <span class="Italic">Paniagua v. GSA</span>, 23 MSPR 229, 232 (1984) (discounting the testimony of an estranged spouse: "[She] has been attempting to get him fired for a number of years, and has unjustly accused him of theft, lying, and engaging in various improprieties while employed by the agency[.]").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a witness may have a bias against the appellant, demonstrated, for example, through civil litigation against the appellant, it does not necessarily follow that the whole of the testimony of that witness will be discredited. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Uske v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 544, 551-52 (1994). Nor, as pointed out in an Opinion (concurring and dissenting in part) of Judge Nichols of the Claims Court does bias suggest that the entire adverse action be thrown out on that basis alone, <span class="Italic">Reynolds v. United States,</span> 454 F.2d 1368, 1378 (Ct. Cl. 1972):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Suppose Cole's role be assimilated to that of a complaining witness. What the court is holding, sub silentio, is that an adverse action is invalid if a complaining witness is biased. We hear a lot about courts favoring the criminals, these days, but I never heard of the most anti-police tribunal ordering a new trial because a prosecution witness was biased. If defense counsel was prevented from cross-examining to show bias, that would of course be another matter. Here, the court has considered the scope of cross-examination that was allowed and has no criticism to offer. Thus, if our trial commissioner reports that Cole was indeed biased, I shall (a) not be astonished, and (b) ask what of it? If the hearing tribunals and adjudicating officials here involved were incapable of discounting a complainant's bias and deciding fairly despite it, our whole machinery to secure fairness in adverse action cases is useless. We might as well junk it and substitute something else, trial by battle, possibly.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should permit a party to introduce the testimony of an individual who <span id="Page_1623"></span>can show that the testimony of significant witnesses may be of inappropriate motivation or doubtful credibility. Testimony should have been permitted to show the agency investigator promised an individual (who became a witness) a job if he cooperated with the investigation. <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 54 MSPR 356, 363 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 380 n.3 (1993) ("the administrative judge abused his discretion in ignoring and disallowing the appellant's evidence of bias on the part of agency witnesses and then discounting on the basis of their friendship with the appellant, his witnesses' testimony"); <span class="Italic">Bonds v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 80, 84 (1988) (of the testimony of a husband and wife working in the same location: "[T]he possibility of bias based on certain relationships and circumstances is a significant factor bearing on a witness' credibility which must be addressed."). An individual's dual role as both the sole complaining witness and the deciding official raises concerns about the credibility of his account of disputed events. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eichner v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 202, 208 &#x00B6; 12 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ may credit testimony from a disinterested third party, not employed by the agency, that supports the agency's case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bonsu v. VA</span>, 3 MSPR 125, 127 (1980). The AJ may favor testimony from someone who is placed at risk by that testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 MSPR 186, 196 (1994) ("Ben's and Slim's testimony is compelling because it was contrary to their interests to admit involvement in misconduct and thus they would have little motivation to fabricate."). Just as evidence of bias is admissible, lack of evidence of bias is probative, <span class="Italic">Cheng v. USDA</span>, 84 MSPR 144, 146 n.1 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Four of the appellant's co-workers testified that they heard the appellant make the alleged comments on one or more of the three occasions specified under the agency's charge. The appellant, in turn, testified that she did not make the comments on any of the three occasions. She also suggested that her co-workers were either untruthful or misunderstood her. The testimony of all four of the agency's witnesses, however, was consistent, whereas the appellant's testimony was uncorroborated. Further, it is unlikely that all four of the witnesses would misunderstand the appellant's words, and the appellant failed to show that they had a motive to lie.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 299, 304 (1988) (crediting the testimony of a witness who did not know the appellant and had no bias against him).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A criminal record may be considered as a negative factor in a credibility analysis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fouquet v. USDA</span>, 82 MSPR 548, 554 &#x00B6; 14 (1999) (as to alleged involvement of the appellant in criminal scheme, AJ could discredit testimony of principal supporting witness who "had served time in both federal and state prisons for credit card fraud, passing counterfeit currency, burglary, and forgery"). Yet past misconduct should not influence a credibility determination unless the misconduct involved the appellant's propensity to tell the truth, <span class="Italic">Eichner v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 202, 207 &#x00B6; 10 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An administrative judge may consider an employee's prior misconduct in order to impeach his credibility only when the prior misconduct involved the employee's propensity for telling the truth. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 73 MSPR 397, 403 (1997). Here, however, the prior misconduct relied on by the administrative judge was the appellant's deliberate disruption of Postal operations, distracting employees, and disobeying direct orders to return to his work unit on February 27, 1996, for which he received a letter of warning and a 14-day suspension. Since this prior misconduct did not involve the appellant's propensity for telling the truth, the administrative judge improperly considered it in determining the credibility of the appellant's testimony. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins,</span> 73 MSPR at 403.</p>
