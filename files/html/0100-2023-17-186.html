<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-184"><span class="space">5.</span> Management Rights; Abrogation of Management Rights Through Contract Articles Providing Appropriate Arrangements; Return to Excessive Interference Standard</h4>
<p class="noindent">Permeating federal sector labor relations is the theme of management rights, expressed in statute and preserved by innumerable negotiability decisions. Management rights are argued in exceptions by agencies to arbitration awards that either enforce contract clauses that arguably defeat management rights or that interpret benign clauses in a way that management believes defeats those rights. The Statute requires that an arbitrator consider the applicability of federal law, including the management rights provisions of 5 USC 7106, when resolving a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, AFLC Hq., AFLC/DPCE and AFGE Council 214</span>, 32 FLRA 261, 266 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA, not arbitrators, makes negotiability determinations after consideration of management rights defenses. Arbitrators, not FLRA, interpret and apply contract provisions constituting arrangements or procedures mitigating the effect of the exercise of management rights. In current practice before FLRA, exceptions raising management rights defenses require FLRA to determine if a contract provision in dispute constitutes a negotiated arrangement or procedure and, if it is, FLRA must then determine the permissible degree of interference with management rights resulting from arbitrator's application of the contract article. Management rights defenses in arbitration must first be presented to the arbitrator, and not ordinarily for the first time to FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, 70 FLRA 398 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), post, summarizes FLRA's recent approach to management rights exceptions to arbitration awards: first, did the arbitrator find a violation of a contract provision?; second, is the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally related to that violation; third, does the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interfere with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right? A negative answer to one question likely results in the award being set aside. A cautionary note: FLRA's analysis of management rights exceptions to awards varies over time and, sometimes, from decision to decision in cases decided within a short time of one another.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCI Dublin and AFGE Local 3584</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-223.html">71 FLRA 1172</a>, 1176 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting in part), involving overtime distribution practices and remedies, instructs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Generally, an award that simply requires an agency to adhere to a provision to which it agreed does not excessively interfere with its management's rights.[44] However, an exception to this general rule would be if an agency can demonstrate that the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision encompasses subjects that are beyond the scope of what an agency can legally agree to under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.[45]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Mont. Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, <span id="page_1992"></span>22 F.3d 1150, 1155-56 (1994) (finding "[t]he nonnegotability of management rights enumerated in [&#x00A7; 7106](a) is expressly '[s]ubject to [7106](b)'" and finding "the agreement cannot subsequently be deemed unlawful...simply because it pertains to a permissible--rather than mandatory--subject of [bargaining]").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405 ("In other words, the '[s]ubject to subsection (b) of this section' in &#x00A7; 7106(a) and the corresponding '[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any [union] from negotiating' language in &#x00A7; 7106(b) do not create a standard to evaluate an arbitrator's award but have to do with what the agency must negotiate or may elect to not negotiate.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See VA and AFGE</span>, 72 FLRA 518, 520 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (generally, an award that simply requires an agency to adhere to a provision to which it agreed does not excessively interfere with its management rights, unless the agency establishes that the contract provision is itself unlawful); <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chapter 178</span>, 72 FLRA 236, 240 (2021) (Chairman DuBester and Member Abbott concurring; Member Kiko dissenting) (duties assignment limitation enforced by arbitrator: "Generally, an award that simply requires an agency to adhere to a provision to which it agreed does not excessively interfere with its management's rights.

<p class="noindent">The analysis first requires recognition of the concept of management rights as a limitation on the awards of arbitrators and as a source of later legal review of those awards by FLRA.

The question is to what degree an award enforcing a contract provision can impinge upon management rights and avoid successful challenge by the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA often compares an award and the contract provision it enforces or construes against the law, generally developed through negotiability determinations, defining management rights,<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 2006 and SSA</span>, 58 FLRA 297, 299 (2003):</p>

Accordingly, it is not improper for an arbitrator, in determining whether a proposed interpretation of an agreement runs afoul of Federal law or Government-wide rule or regulation, to rely on Authority negotiability precedent. Therefore, the Union has not established that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may impose on the party arguing that an award violates management rights the burden of demonstrating that a contract provision enforced or interpreted by an arbitrator was not the product of arrangements or impact bargaining, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FMC Lexington and AFGE Local 817</span>, 69 FLRA 10, 14 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>

<p class="noindent">Not quite paralleling negotiability analysis is the review standard imposed by an arbitrator or FLRA to determine if the application of a negotiated provision interferes with a management right to the degree that its enforcement is legally impermissible, i.e., the award is not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the years, FLRA judged a management rights exception to an arbitration award by an excessive interference or abrogation standard, depending on the persuasion of those FLRA members then in the majority. Back and forth, back and forth, like a seesaw, went the analysis. Through early 2018, the prevailing standard was abrogation. Then new members were appointed to the FLRA by President Trump and the old law became the new; back came the excessive interference standard--imposed or reimposed by <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a>, 398-406 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting). The arbitration award was relatively routine, involving review of a shift change arrangement, with the unusual feature that the contract provision reserved certain assignments, days off, and shifts for non-bargaining-unit employees before they were assigned to unit employees. Disappointed with the result, the agency filed exceptions. FLRA changed the analysis of a management rights exception from abrogation to excessive interference--a standard that predated the abrogation standard, and a standard that FLRA summarized as whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision, and, if so, whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of its mission, the Agency provides medical services to approximately 210,000 federal inmates. In order to provide these services, the Agency utilizes two types of employees: bargaining-unit employees who are covered by the parties' agreement; and U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHS) officers who are members of the uniformed services and are excluded from representation by &#x00A7; 7103 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unit employees work in a variety of medical positions, including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, dentists, and physical therapists. Since the 1930s, the Agency also has used PHS officers to provide this medical care. Because of the nature of the workplace, all employees also perform some correctional duties. The number of PHS officers utilized has increased over time, and, out of about 3,600 medical professionals, approximately twenty-four percent are PHS officers. All bargaining-unit employees and PHS employees also perform some correctional duties. The Agency testified that the correctional duties as well as less competitive pay than the private sector increase the challenge of recruiting PHS employees to work in the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a national grievance concerning the bidding processes under Articles 18 and 19 of the parties' agreement. Article 18(d)(2) states that the Agency will post a blank roster "for the purpose of giving [correctional staff] advance notice of assignments, days off, and shifts that are available for which they will be given the opportunity to submit their preference request." Prior to posting this roster, the Agency set aside a number of assignments, days off, and shifts for PHS officers. Article 19 concerns bidding for annual leave. In some instances, the Agency set aside days of vacation for PHS officers; in others, the Agency allowed PHS officers to participate in the same bidding process as bargaining-unit employees. The Union's grievance alleged, as relevant here, that the Agency violated the parties' agreement as well as &#x00A7; 7103 by setting aside slots from the bidding process and allowing PHS officers to participate in the bidding process under the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties were unable to resolve the issue, and they submitted it to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Arbitrator framed the issue as whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement and the Statute when it reserved assignments, days off, and shifts for PHS officers, preventing bargaining-unit employees from bidding on those slots, as well as allowing PHS officers to participate in the vacation selection process along with bargaining-unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At arbitration, the Union argued that the Agency violated Article 18 when it withheld and removed posts from the roster on which bargaining-unit employees bid for slots. Furthermore, the Union argued that PHS officers, as members of a uniformed service, were excluded from getting any benefits from collective bargaining under the Statute. As such, the Union continued, the Agency violated the Statute when it allowed PHS officers to participate in the bidding process established in the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that, under the rights to assign employees and assign work in &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, it has the right to determine where employees will be assigned and what assignments it will offer to bargaining-unit employees for bidding. As such, "[r]equiring the [A]gency to offer ALL posts to the bargaining unit for their placement by seniority prior to assigning non-bargaining[-]unit employees...directly interferes with management's right[s] to assign [employees] and assign work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that Article 18 of the parties' agreement prevented the Agency from setting aside slots for PHS officers and that, in doing so, the Agency violated the parties' agreement and the Statute. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the parties' agreement limits the Agency's right to assign and prevents the Agency from assigning PHS officers to any post or days off. Additionally, the Arbitrator found that, by setting vacation time apart for PHS officers prior to the bidding process in the parties' agreement, the Agency was "circumventing the contractually[&#8197;]agreed bidding process." The Arbitrator further stated that the Agency should exclude PHS officers from any contractual bidding process in order to be "consistent with its obligations under [the Statute]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to follow the bidding process in Article 18. Specifically, the Arbitrator ordered that the Agency should not withhold any assignments, days off, or shifts from the roster of slots available for bargaining-unit employees to bid on, and that the Agency should not set aside vacation slots for PHS officers or allow PHS officers to participate in the contractual bidding process for vacation slots.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions to the award on November 2, 2016; the Union filed an opposition to those exceptions on December 7, 2016.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because it violates its management rights to assign employees and to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. As noted above, when an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, the duties will be assigned. This right also includes the right to assign work to non-bargaining-unit employees. The right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) includes the right to make initial assignments to positions, to reassign employees to different positions, and to make temporary assignments or details.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Agency requests that the Authority reconsider the current standard that we apply when considering an assertion that an award is contrary to a management right. We agree that a thorough reexamination is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute established procedures which permit federal agencies and <span id="page_1994"></span>unions to negotiate collective-bargaining agreements and to resolve disputes through negotiated grievance procedures. But it also included in &#x00A7; 7106(a) enumerated rights which could not be compromised by any of the other provisions and procedures set forth in the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Labor Relations Authority was entrusted with the responsibility to interpret and apply the Statute.&#x2003;Since its inception the Authority has grappled with articulating a coherent, consistent, and understandable framework to determine when an arbitral award impermissibly interferes with &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When Congress enacted the Statute, and enumerated those rights, it could not have imagined that arbitrators--with no particular expertise or training--would, over time, view their authority so expansively as to make rulings that impact the ability of federal agencies to carry out their fundamental missions and operations, that impact how federal agencies safeguard the nation's security or their own internal security practices, or that compel federal agencies to spend funds appropriated by Congress in a manner which runs counter to specific statutory mandates or restrictions. Nonetheless, with the Authority's help, the rulings of arbitrators have been permitted to ever more directly encroach upon and undermine how federal agencies carry out their essential governmental functions. Consider the following examples:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;An arbitrator dictated that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency could not determine how and when it could restrict employee use of government computers (despite recent and repeated hacks associated with employees' personal use of the agency's computers) without first seeking the permission of the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;An arbitrator required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to pay entirely discretionary awards from a subsequent year's budget even when the agency was under sequestration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;An arbitrator instructed the U.S. Department of the Air Force how it had misinterpreted its own statute for 119 years.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;An arbitrator mandated how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security must interpret the Inspector General Act thereby extending representational rights of unions into inspector-general investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x2022;&#x2003;An arbitrator ordered that the U.S. Department of the Navy must purchase bottled water for its employees despite having no appropriations from Congress for that purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Until 1987, the Authority used two approaches: in some instances, the Authority ruled that any grievance which "interfere[d]" with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right was not arbitrable as a matter of law;[18] in other instances, the Authority ruled that arbitrators, while not precluded from considering substantive issues which may impact &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights, could not "impose requirements on [agencies]...over and above those specified by [applicable laws]."[19]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Newark Air Force Station Activity</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 632-33 (1987) (discussing, e.g., <span class="Italic">BEP, Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 20 FLRA 380 (1985); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 13 FLRA 732, 734 (1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 635.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority settled upon the latter approach in December 1987.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station Activity</span>, the Authority's two-member quorum found that "the question of any impermissible arbitral interference with [&#x00A7; 7106(a)] rights must be directed to the merits" of a grievance and that an arbitrator could determine only whether the agency acted "<span class="Italic">in accordance with applicable laws</span>" or whether the agency violated a specific provision negotiated into the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Four weeks later, in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> (<span class="Italic">SSA 1988</span>),[23] the Authority concluded that "the restrictions [found in &#x00A7; 7106(a)] on the remedial authority of arbitrators [were] not warranted" so long as an arbitrator found that the agency violated <span class="Italic">"[any]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> law, [rule,]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> regulation, or...collective[-]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">bargaining agreement</span>." According to the Authority, at that time, "the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 [did] not trump &#x00A7; 7121," because any alleged "violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment" were subject to grievance procedures. In other words, there was <span class="Italic">little to no limit</span> on an arbitrator's authority "to substitute their judgment for that of management" in fashioning a remedy for such violations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;30 FLRA 1156, 1160 (1988).</p>

According to the Court, "[t]he FLRA's position [that &#x00A7; 7106(a) does not 'supersede the grievance requirement of &#x00A7; 7121'] is <span class="Italic">flatly contradicted</span> by the language of &#x00A7; 7106(a)'s command that '<span class="Italic">nothing in this chapter'--i.e. nothing in the entire [Statute]</span><span class="Italic"></span>--shall affect the authority of agency officials to make [determinations concerning &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights] in accordance with applicable laws." The Court concluded that "there are <span class="Italic">no 'external limitations'</span> on management rights, insofar as union powers under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are concerned, <span class="Italic">other than</span> the limitations imposed by '<span class="Italic">applicable laws</span>.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority seemingly ignored <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> for seven years until <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span> (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>).[32] In <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority attempted to make &#x00A7; 7106(b) work--where &#x00A7; 7121(d) had failed--to define a "<span class="Italic">separate limitation</span> on, or <span class="Italic">exception</span> to, management rights under [&#x00A7;] 7106(a)."[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the two-Member quorum established a "revised" two-pronged framework to determine when an arbitrator's award adversely affects &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights.[34] Under its first prong, the Authority found that "an arbitration award that affects management rights...may provide a remedy only for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to &#x00A7; 7106(a) that are set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b)."[35] Then, under the second prong, the Authority decided it would analyze whether the remedy for such a violation (in the case of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, a violation of negotiated provisions requiring the agency to follow specific procedures concerning the application of performance standards[36]) reflected a "reconstruction" of what the agency would have done had it acted in accordance with the negotiated provisions.[37] If the remedy was not a "reconstruction" of what the agency would have done, the remedy would be found contrary to law.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">That analysis, however, was flawed in two critical respects and was later criticized by several Members.[39] First, the decision effectively circumnavigated <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> insofar as the Court held that "<span class="Italic">nothing</span> in this entire Statute" may compromise &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights. Second, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> rejected "reconstruction," as used in that case as a remedial tool, describing it as "entirely disconnected from the text of the Statute."[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;Abrogation was a standard which had been abandoned by the Authority eight years earlier because, effectively and in practice, it was impossible to prove. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Then, in 2012, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stepped in. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, Office of Chief Counsel, Washington, District of Columbia. v.

<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with the D.C. Circuit's implicit rejection of abrogation, we will no longer follow that standard. Instead, we will return to the excessive interference test in order that we may return to the flexibility inherent in that standard and required to address the varied contexts in which it will be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just seven months after the court's rejection of abrogation, another two-member quorum reduced <span class="Italic">IRS OCC</span> to "law of the case" status, which effectively ensured that an agency could not successfully challenge an arbitrator's award on the grounds that an award is contrary to law in the manner it impacts a &#x00A7; 7106(a) right.[57]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[57]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 67 FLRA 705, 707 (2014) (minimizing <span class="Italic">IRS OCC</span> as "the law of the case"). We disagree with our dissenting colleague's attempt to ignore and minimize a binding decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. While our colleague believes the court was "mistaken[&#8197;]" (Dissent at 3), the court made the same determination, as did the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, that arbitral awards arising out of &#x00A7; 7121 may not interfere with &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ironically, one of the few points on which all three members in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span> agreed was that the consensus framework, unlike the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, was intended to foster "flexibility." Despite that consensus, the two-member quorum in <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Disability Adjudication &#x0026; Review, Region VI, New Orleans, Louisiana</span>, (<span class="Italic">SSA ODAR</span>) transformed the <span class="Italic">FDIC/EPA</span> framework into one that was not just inflexible, but one that must be followed "in every case, no matter how inconsistent or illegal is the arbitrator's award."[58] The quorum in <span class="Italic">SSA ODAR</span>, however, concluded that in order for an agency to argue that an arbitral award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a), it must first "allege <span class="Italic">not only</span> that the award affects a right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), <span class="Italic">but also</span> that the agreement provision that the arbitrator has enforced is <span class="Italic">not</span> the type of contract provision that falls <span class="Italic">within &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute</span>."[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 602.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two problems with <span class="Italic">SSA ODAR</span>. First, that requirement is not supported by the Statute; and, second, neither <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> nor <span class="Italic">EPA</span> required such an assertion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">FDIC</span> stated, quite simply, that when an agency "establishes that an award imposes a constraint on management rights that was not agreed to by the parties...the award will be set aside."[60] The Authority also explained that "<span class="Italic">if</span> the award affects [a management] right, <span class="Italic">then</span>, under the applicable legal framework, <span class="Italic">the Authority examines</span>, as relevant here, whether the award provides a remedy for a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)."[61] But there simply was no mention that an agency must <span class="Italic">first</span> allege that the provision "is not the type of contract provision that falls within &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute,"[62] before it may argue that an award constrains a management right. To the contrary, <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span> only require a party to "<span class="Italic">contend</span>[&#8197;] that [the] <span class="Italic">award</span> is contrary to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute"[63] and then the Authority "assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted [management right]"[64] and "examines...whether the award provides a remedy for a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute."[65]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 107.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Thus, it appears to us that requiring an agency to argue that a disputed provision was <span class="Italic">not</span> negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) in order to argue that an award violates a &#x00A7; 7106(a) right served but one purpose--to avoid reaching any question that would require a reexamination of the Authority's "abrogation" standard. On the one hand, if the agency argues that a provision was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) then the only question which the Authority will answer is whether the remedy is reasonably related to the violation. On the other hand, if the agency does not argue that the provision <span class="Italic">was</span> negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b), its argument is summarily dismissed. Thus, the agency is always trapped in a proverbial catch-22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is quite telling that, since <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, no agency has been able to successfully navigate the procedural and substantive roadblocks that <span class="Italic">FDIC/EPA</span> and their unfortunate progeny have imposed on the ability to successfully challenge and establish that an arbitrator's award impermissibly interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such an absolute standard is not consistent with the basic construct of our Statute.&#x2003;Consequently, we do not agree that an agency is required, in all circumstances, to "allege" first that a contract provision as interpreted by an arbitrator "is <span class="Italic">not</span> the type of contract provision <span class="Italic">that falls within</span> &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute" [66] in order to argue that the award impermissibly affects a &#x00A7; 7106(a) right or is otherwise contrary to law. And in the event the issue at hand requires a determination as to whether a provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), then the burden falls on the party making that assertion to prove that the provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[66]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA ODAR</span>, 67 FLRA at 602 (emphasis added) (erroneously citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP</span>, 66 FLRA 634, 638 (2012)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> and <span class="Italic">FDIC/EPA</span> frameworks share at least one more critical flaw beyond those discussed above. Both frameworks effectively presume that most, if not all, provisions that make their way into a collective bargaining agreement must have been negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) and thus constitute an exception to, or waiver of, an agency's &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights. But, contrary to that underlying presumption, the frameworks fail to recognize that some provisions, which make their way into negotiated agreements, have nothing whatsoever to do with &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Anyone who has engaged in the process of negotiating at the bargaining table is well aware that as a practical matter some provisions demonstrate nothing more than a common intent (i.e. to establish a means of regular communication), a common interest (i.e. to support general principles of equal employment opportunity), or a common commitment to try something different (i.e. adopting a best practice approach to a common recurring problem).[67] Other provisions make their way into collective bargaining agreements as an imposed agreement or order of the Federal Service Impasses Panel (FSIP) under &#x00A7; 7119(c)(5)(C).[68] And yet other provisions may be agreed to, not as a surrender of an agency's &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights, but as a union-management partnership initiative (i.e. E.O. 13522 or E.O. 12871). The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of provisions <span id="page_1996"></span>are negotiated without any discussion as to the statutory authority under which a provision is being negotiated. The only point that may become an issue is when a dispute arises as to whether or not the agency must <span class="Italic">negotiate</span> over a specific provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[67]&#x2003;E.g. <span class="Italic">Matter of Dep't of the Army &#x0026; Local 259</span>, 95 FSIP 106, 1995 WL 564878, *5 n.11 (1995) (noting provision where parties "committed themselves to teamwork, open communications and joint problem-solving in order to meet the mutual interests of the employees, labor and management").</p>

Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">AFGE Locals</span>) (such provisions must be "regarded as part of [the parties' collective bargaining agreement]...during the term of the agreement.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of determining whether an arbitrator's award or remedy adversely affects a &#x00A7; 7106(a) right, it does not matter why, how, or <span class="Italic">under what section of the Statute</span> a provision makes its way into a collective bargaining agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any other agreement. Quite simply--and a point that has been lost in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, <span class="Italic">FDIC/EPA</span>, and their progeny--&#x00A7; 7106(b) limits the subjects on which the agency may not "<span class="Italic">negotiate</span>" or on which the agency may elect, or not, to <span class="Italic">negotiate</span>.[69] In other words, the "[s]ubject to subsection (b) of this section" in &#x00A7; 7106(a) and the corresponding "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any [union] from negotiating" language in &#x00A7; 7106(b) do not create a standard to evaluate an arbitrator's award but have to do with what the agency must <span class="Italic">negotiate</span> or may elect to <span class="Italic">not negotiate</span>.[70]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, when the Authority added to the <span class="Italic">FDIC/EPA</span> framework in <span class="Italic">SSA, ODAR</span> an absolute requirement--in order for an agency to argue that an arbitral award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) it must first argue that the provision in dispute is "not the type of contract provision that falls <span class="Italic">within &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute</span>"[71] and in order to avoid addressing the Court's implicit rejection of the abrogation standard in <span class="Italic">IRS OCC</span>[72]--the Authority undercut the "delicate balance" that &#x00A7; 7106 was to play in balancing the rights between Federal unions and agencies, a central premise of the Statute.[73]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's unnecessary focus on whether a provision was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) in order to evaluate whether an arbitrator's award and remedy adversely affects a &#x00A7; 7106(a) right has caused the Authority to "los[e] sight of some aspects of the Statute and the [Supreme Court's] decision in [<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>]" as surely did the Authority's earlier focus on reconstruction in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.[74] As Chairman Pope noted in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, "an agency's [&#x00A7;] 7106(a) rights are limited <span class="Italic">only to the extent the parties bargained for</span>."[75]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As such, the test that we adopt today for determining whether an arbitrator's award and remedy adversely affects a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right looks to the plain language of the Statute and the Supreme Court's guidance in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>. The test we adopt will apply to an arbitrator's interpretation of <span class="Italic">any</span> provision contained in a collective bargaining agreement whether that provision is negotiated into the parties' agreement as a common interest, intent, or commitments, as the result of an agreement or order of the FSIP, as a labor-management partnership initiative, or under &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first question that must be answered is whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision.&#x2003;If the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that violation. If the answer to any of these questions is no, then the award must be vacated. But, if the answer to the second question is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. If the answer to this question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It should be noted that this standard is not meant to be the sole method of challenging an award that affects a management right.&#x2003;For example, a party could challenge an arbitrator's interpretation of a contract provision as not being reasonable or plausible and thus as failing to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. The standard we outline today is for determining whether an arbitrator's interpretation of a provision excessively interferes with a management right reserved in &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent, that prior decisions of the Authority, including <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, and <span class="Italic">EPA</span> have held to the contrary, they will no longer be followed.[76]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the merits of the current case, the Agency argues that the award is contrary to its management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 to assign employees and to assign work.[77] Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Section 18 requiring that all positions be made available to bargaining-unit employees before any other employees "completely abrogates management's right to assign work and assign employees."[78] The Agency argues that, under the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18, the Agency cannot assign anyone other than bargaining-unit employees to posts, including situations where the Agency might need some special expertise in a certain post for health or safety reasons. In short, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18 gives "unfettered preference and power to bargaining[-]unit employees."[79]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Looking to the standard established above, the answer to the first question--whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a provision--is yes.[80] As to the second question--whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation--the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to "follow the bidding process set forth in Article 18."[81] Consequently, the remedy of adhering to Article 18 reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation of Article 18, and the answer to the second question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[80]&#x2003;Award at 40.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[81]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 41.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we turn to the last question--whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106 management right. Although the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18 abrogates its management rights to assign employees and to assign work, we will, as discussed above, apply the excessive interference standard. By restricting the Agency to a point where it is no longer able to assign work to employees outside of the bargaining unit, the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18 clearly excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees and to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106. As such, the answer to the final question is yes. Consequently, the portions of the Arbitrator's award relying on this interpretation are contrary to law, and we vacate them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find portions of the award contrary to law and vacate those portions, we do not need to address the Agency's remaining exceptions[82] solely challenging the vacated portions of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[82]&#x2003;Exceptions at 9 (arguing that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 25 (arguing that the award is contrary to D.C. Circuit precedent).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we vacate the portions of the award dealing with the Agency's practice of setting aside assignments, days off, and shifts for PHS officers, the Agency's management rights arguments above do not provide any arguments for setting aside the portions of the award dealing with the participation of PHS officers in any bidding process under the parties' agreement. As such, we now address the Agency's arguments pertaining, in whole or in part, to that finding.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span> was relied on in a decision vacating an arbitration award of a backpay remedy for an employee who was denied telework. The arbitrator determined that the justification for the denial was insufficiently specific. Under the proportionality analysis, FLRA determined that the employee might have been entitled to a more complete explanation but not to a backpay remedy, <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 70 FLRA 932, 932-34 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we reject an arbitrator's attempt to carve out a unique telework arrangement for a single employee that could not, and would not, apply to any other employee in the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Marshall A.&#x2003;Snider found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by providing an insufficiently specific justification for its denial of the grievant's request to telework full time from Las Vegas, Nevada, notwithstanding that the Agency is located in Ogden, Utah. Applying the framework articulated in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>), we find that the Arbitrator's awarded remedies do not reasonably and proportionally relate to the Agency's contractual violation, and we vacate the award as contrary to management's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II. <span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was assigned to Hill Air Force Base (Hill AFB) in Ogden, Utah, and she teleworked full-time from her home in Ogden. After the <span id="page_1997"></span>grievant's husband accepted a position at Nellis Air Force Base (Nellis AFB) in Las Vegas, Nevada, the grievant asked the Agency to change her duty station to Nellis AFB and allow her to telework full-time from Las Vegas. The Agency denied the request, and the Union filed a grievance challenging the denial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its grievance response, the Agency explained that it denied the grievance based on its management right, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, to determine its organization. Further, Article 9 of the parties' agreement (Article 9) provides that "employees who [t]elework must be available to work at the traditional worksite on [t]elework days on an occasional basis if necessitated by work requirements." The Agency denied the grievant's request to telework full-time from Las Vegas because the grievant could not--consistent with Article 9--report from Las Vegas to Hill AFB within a reasonable time if necessary. Accordingly, the Agency denied the grievance, and the grievant resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance went to arbitration where, as relevant here, the Arbitrator framed the issue as whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement, law, rule, or regulation when it denied the grievant's request to change her duty station and telework full-time from Las Vegas.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement, law, rule, or regulation by denying the grievant's request <span class="Italic">to change her duty station</span>. But he found that the Agency violated Article 9 by denying the grievant's request <span class="Italic">to telework full-time from Las Vegas</span>. Article 9, Section 1 provides, in pertinent part, that eligible employees may participate in the telework program "to the maximum extent possible." Article 9, Section 4 states that management has the "sole discretion" to determine an employee's telework schedule, but also provides that, when denying a requested telework schedule, management will advise the employee of the specific--rather than "generic"--justification for the denial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that even though Article 9 requires teleworkers to be available to report to Hill AFB, the Agency's reliance on this requirement to deny the grievant's telework request was "arbitrary," "generic," and did not ensure that the grievant could participate in the telework program "to the maximum extent possible." Accordingly, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 9. The Arbitrator also found that, but for the Agency's contractual violation, the grievant would not have resigned. As remedies, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to reinstate the grievant, allow her to telework full-time from Las Vegas, and provide her backpay and lost benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 4, 2017, the Agency filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's award and, on September 11, 2017, the Union filed an opposition to the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III. <span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Arbitrator's remedies do not reasonably and proportionally relate to the violation of Article 9.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award excessively interferes with management's right to determine its organization under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute because it effectively requires management to change the grievant's duty station to Las Vegas and permit her to telework from there. Specifically, the Agency contends that, although the award permits the Agency to maintain the grievant's duty station at Hill AFB, allowing the grievant to telework full-time from Las Vegas triggers a regulatory requirement that the Agency change the grievant's "official worksite" to Las Vegas. The Authority has recognized that management's right to determine its organization encompasses the right to determine the administrative and functional structure of the agency.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 58 FLRA 175, 178 (2002) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Evaluating the Agency's argument under the three-part framework set forth in DOJ, the first question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision. Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's "generic" denial of the grievant's telework request violated Article 9. Thus, the answer to the first question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second question under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> is whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation of Article 9.[14] If the answer to that question is no, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated.[15]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Article 9 provides that management has the "sole discretion" to approve or deny a requested telework schedule, but must provide a specific--rather than "generic"--justification for a denial. The Arbitrator found that the Agency's justification for its denial--that the grievant would not be able to fulfill her obligation to report to Hill AFB within a reasonable time if necessary--was "generic." Yet, as remedies, he ordered the Agency to reinstate the grievant, allow her to telework full-time from Las Vegas, and provide her backpay and lost benefits. Those remedies are disproportionate to the Agency's violation of Article 9. Because Article 9 affords management the "sole discretion" to determine an employee's telework schedule, the Agency's failure to provide the grievant with a specific justification for the denial of her telework request would entitle the grievant to, at most, a <span class="Italic">more specific</span> justification for the denial. Thus, reinstatement--in addition to the other awarded remedies--is disproportionate here. Because the Arbitrator's remedies do not reasonably and proportionally relate to the Agency's violation of Article 9, the answer to the second question is no.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we appreciate the dissent's veiled compliment, the dissent mischaracterizes (or misunderstands) the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework itself and how that framework applies here. The dissent criticizes our application of the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework because, "the first step in analyzing [a management-right] claim would be to determine whether the award affects in any way the asserted management right" and implies that this in some magical way creates a new fourth step. <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> only applies in cases where the awards or remedies affected a management right, and we firmly reject the dissent's attempt to confuse the issue as it pertains to <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>. That case (the relevant "on-point precedent") and <span class="Italic">IRS</span> left no ambiguity as to the steps for determining when an award impermissibly interferes with a management right. Here, if the Agency implemented the awarded remedies, then government-wide regulations would require the Agency to change the grievant's official duty station. And, as part of the Agency's "right to determine [its] administrative and functional structure," the Agency has the right to determine "where[,] organizationally[,] certain functions shall be established and <span class="Italic">where the duty stations of the positions</span> providing those functions <span class="Italic">shall be maintained</span>."[23] Therefore, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> properly applies in this case. Having found the award deficient using that framework, we set aside the award as contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Maritime Admin</span>., 61 FLRA 816, 822 (2006) (<span class="Italic">DOT</span>) (emphases added) (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 55 FLRA 830, 832 (1999)). To the extent that other Authority decisions selectively cited by the dissent have diverged from this clear test--under which determining an employee's <span class="Italic">official duty station</span> necessarily affects management's right to determine the agency's organization--we will no longer follow them. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Educ., Wash., D.C</span>., 61 FLRA 307, 309-310 (2005) (<span class="Italic">DOE</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1286-88 (1991); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3601</span>, 39 FLRA 504, 515-16 (1991); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 411-413 (1990). Those decisions failed to recognize that, every time an employee's official duty station changes, that change <span class="Italic">necessarily affects</span> an agency's "administrative structure." For example, an agency must administer locality-based payments using an employee's official duty station, but some decisions discounted these administrative effects without explanation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOE</span>, 61 FLRA at 310 (stating that <span class="Italic">paying travel expenses</span>, which changed based on worksite location, affected agency's administrative structure, but holding that <span class="Italic">paying salaries</span>, which changed based on worksite location, did not affect administrative structure). We may not ignore such significant effects.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the resolution of this case has little to do with telework. Instead, the Arbitrator's remedy, if implemented, would require the Agency to change the grievant's official duty station.[25] [26] The Agency has the right to determine "where[,] organizationally[,] certain functions shall be established and <span class="Italic">where the duty stations of the positions</span> providing those functions <span class="Italic">shall be maintained</span>."[27] And because we find that the remedy is not proportional to the contractual violation, we do not reach the third question under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;Member Abbott notes that in addition to requiring a change to the grievant's duty station, the award, if permitted to stand, also would have required the Agency to establish a duty station that was unique <span class="Italic">only to the grievant</span>. That result both failed to draw its essence from the parties' agreement and directly interfered with the Agency's right to determine its organization. It is preposterous to assume that an arbitrator has the discretion to carve out an exception for one employee, an exception that does not, and cannot, apply to any other employee in the Agency or the Federal government. Arbitrators may not simply craft awards that are based on their own notions of "industrial justice." <span class="Italic">See U.S. Small Bus. Admin</span>., 70 FLRA 745, 745 n.1 (2018).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement excessively interferes with a management right.[23] The Authority has long held that management's rights to direct employees and assign work include the right to establish performance standards in order to supervise and determine the quantity, quality, and timeliness of work required of employees.[24] Furthermore, management's right to assign work includes the right to establish quotas for assessing employee performance.[25] Here, the award prohibits management from setting a standard quota--an average of fifty per month--for the number of hearings an employee must schedule in order to be eligible for telework. In <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring, Texas,</span> the Authority found that an award excessively interfered with management's right to assign work because it prevented the agency from determining the appropriate number of employees per shift.[27] Similarly, the award here excessively interferes with management's right to assign work here because it prevents the Agency from determining the appropriate number of hearings for its judges to schedule per month. Because the answer to the last question is yes, the award excessively interferes with management's rights, and we vacate the portion of the award requiring the Agency to conduct an individualized determination for the grievant and allow the grievant to telework if she schedules an average of forty-five cases for hearing per month.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We now apply the new framework set forth in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>. As the issue is whether the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a), the first question that must be answered is whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision. If the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation. If the answer to either of these questions is no, then the award must be vacated. But, if the answer to the second question is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. If the answer to this question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Articles 6, 18, and 27 of the parties' agreement, so the answer to the first question is yes. As a remedy for the violation, the Arbitrator directed the Agency as to how it must staff the third-floor posts during the daytime. So the answer to the second question is also yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, this case turns on whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement excessively interferes with management's rights to assign work and to determine internal security. By requiring the Agency to always staff the third floors of the housing units, the Arbitrator denies the Agency the ability to determine how it should staff the prison. The Agency can no longer move officers to a different area of the institution or make basic managerial decisions regarding staffing resources. In short, the Arbitrator substituted his judgment for that of the Agency on how to best secure and safeguard the prison, and his award excessively interferes with the Agency's &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights to assign work and to determine internal security. Accordingly, we vacate the award.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">On May 12, 2017, Arbitrator Michael Hill issued an award finding that the Agency violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement and a separate memorandum of understanding by failing to permit an employee (the grievant) to "opt out" of an involuntary reassignment to a different position (the new position). The Arbitrator also found that another Agency employee (the volunteer) offered to take the grievant's place in the new position. As a remedy, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to permit the volunteer to work in the new position so that the grievant could return to her former position (the former position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main question before us is whether the Arbitrator's award is contrary to management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. Applying the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP (DOJ)</span>, we find that the award excessively interferes with that right, and we vacate the pertinent portions of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency employs individuals who specialize in combatting identity theft and assisting identity-theft victims (the specialists). Previously, the specialists worked in several different Agency subdivisions, but the Agency decided to centralize the specialists' work in a new subdivision (the realignment). Before executing the realignment, the Agency and the Union entered into a realignment-specific memorandum of understanding (the MOU) that supplemented their collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After learning about the realignment, the grievant requested to "opt out" of participating. The Agency asserted that, in order to opt out under the MOU, the grievant had to satisfy the conditions in Article 15 of the parties' agreement for a job swap or hardship relocation. Because the grievant did not satisfy those conditions, the Agency denied her opt-out request. The Union filed a grievance over the denial. The parties went to arbitration, where the stipulated issues were, as relevant here, "whether the Agency violated Article 15 of the parties'...[a]greement [(Article 15)] and/or the [MOU], when it denied the...grievant['s] request[&#8197;] to opt out of reassignment into the" new subdivision, and, if so, "what shall be the remedy?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that the MOU states that current Agency specialists "who are realigning into the [new subdivision]...may opt out of performing the work in accordance with [the realignment] initiative[,] consistent with workload and staffing needs and Article 15." And the Arbitrator noted that Article 15 addresses reassignments and realignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the MOU's "opt[-]out provisions...with references to Article 15...are available to involuntarily reassigned employees if qualified volunteers are available to replace them." Further, the Arbitrator determined that qualified volunteers must be "at the same grade level" of the General Schedule (GS) as an involuntarily reassigned employee in order to take the involuntarily reassigned employee's place in the new subdivision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1999"></span>In the grievant's case, the Arbitrator found that the Union had identified a volunteer with sufficient "identity[-]theft experience" to work in the new subdivision, and that the volunteer worked at the grievant's GS grade level. Thus, the Arbitrator held that the Agency's denial of the grievant's opt-out request violated the MOU and the parties' agreement. As a remedy, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to comply with the MOU and Article 15 by allowing the grievant to return to her former position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 16, 2017, the Agency filed exceptions to the award, and on July 20, 2017, the Union filed an opposition to the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The award violates managementAs right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award violates its management right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute because the award does not allow the Agency to "determine the particular qualifications and skills needed to perform the work of a position" within the new subdivision. Further, the Agency argues that, as a result of the realignment, the grievant's former position no longer exists, so returning the grievant to that position would require re-creating it. The Agency also contends that the award fails to "reconstruct[&#8197;]" what the Agency would have done if it complied with the MOU and the parties' agreement and that, consequently, the award fails to satisfy the second prong of the management-rights analysis that the Authority set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Washington, D.C. (BEP)</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign employees includes the rights: (1) to decide "whether to fill positions"; and (2) "to determine the qualifications and skills needed to perform the work of a position, including job-related individual characteristics..., and...whether individual employees meet those qualifications." In that regard, the Authority has held that a requirement to "transfer...an employee to a position in [a subdivision] of the employee's choice,] regardless of whether [an a]gency intend[ed] to fill the position or whether the employee's qualifications satisfied the [a]gency's needs," placed a "significant limitation" on management's right to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As recently explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, "the Authority has grappled with articulating a coherent, consistent, and understandable framework to determine when an arbitral award impermissibly interferes with &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights."[17] In particular, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> detailed how <span class="Italic">BEP</span>--on which the Agency relies--and the Authority's later decisions in <span class="Italic">FDIC, Division of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Protection, San Francisco Region (FDIC)</span>[18] and <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA (EPA)</span>[19] created "<span class="Italic">confusion</span>."[20] Against this background, we interpret the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">BEP</span> as a request to reexamine the Authority's framework for resolving management-rights exceptions to arbitration awards. Further, because <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> included such a reexamination and formulated a new framework to govern cases such as this one, we apply the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework here.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the first question that must be answered is whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision.[21] If the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation.[22] If the answer to either of these questions is no, then the award must be vacated.[23] But, if the answer to the second question is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the provision excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right.[24] If the answer to this question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and must be vacated.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405-06.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the answer to the first question is yes because the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated contract provisions--specifically, the MOU and Article 15. As to the second question, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to allow the grievant to exercise "the opt[-]out provision[ ] of the MOU with references to Article 15." Consequently, the remedy of adhering to the MOU and Article 15 reasonably and proportionally relates to the violation of the MOU and Article 15, and the answer to the second question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we turn to the last question--whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the MOU and Article 15 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). Here, the Agency asserts that the award is contrary to its right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7102(a)(2)(A) because the award: (1) prevents the Agency from determining the qualifications necessary to work in the new subdivision, and from evaluating whether the volunteer meets those qualifications; and (2) requires the Agency to re-create the grievant's former position, which no longer exists in her former subdivision, and reassign her to that re-created position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By requiring that the Agency re-create the grievant's former position and then reassign the grievant to that position, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the MOU and Article 15 denies the Agency the ability to determine which positions exist, and which positions should be filled, in the grievant's former subdivision.[31] Further, the award places additional "significant limitation[s]"[32] on management's right to assign employees by: (1) determining that the volunteer is qualified to replace the grievant;[33] and (2) directing the Agency to transfer the grievant "regardless of whether...the [grievant]'s qualifications satisfied the Agency's needs"[34] in her former subdivision rather than the new subdivision.[35] Because of these significant limitations, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the MOU and Article 15 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).[36] As such, the answer to the final question in the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework is yes, and we vacate the portions of the award relating to the grievant's returning to her former position.[37]</p>

Instead, the new test is a review of the measure of the impact of the arbitration award or remedy on the management rights that Congress provided in &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;Our dissenting colleague confuses entirely the distinction between the FLRA's role in determining what matters are, or are not, negotiable <span class="Italic">at the bargaining table</span> and the distinct role of the FLRA in determining whether an arbitrator's <span class="Italic">interpretation of a negotiated contract provision</span> is consistent with or contrary to law. The dissent asserts that the new <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> test is merely a back-door attempt to reassess the negotiability of settled contract provisions. But the dissent misses the point, entirely. <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> focuses entirely on an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a contractual provision, not on whether or not the provision is negotiable. Rather, it is the arbitrator's unique award or remedy that is tested. Negotiation of a provision (and determination of its negotiability) occurs just once, but, during the course of an agreement's lifetime, one or many arbitrators may interpret the meaning of that provision. The purpose of <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> was to set forth an effective and understandable test to determine whether or not an arbitrator's interpretation of such a provision or the awarded remedy excessively interferes with a management right. Questions of negotiability are made at the bargaining table.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The dissent seemingly sets out to complicate the simple, clear framework we set out in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>. The dissents seeks to resurrect the "abrogation" standard which was discarded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014 and by the Authority in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> in 2018 while at the same time invoking an unrecognizable excessive-interference standard. In doing so, the dissent implicitly affirms the observation made in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, that the Authority has struggled to find a proper, effective, and understandable test with which to weigh arbitration awards and to enforce our Statute's singular management-rights provision. As we explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, and repeat herein, the FLRA's role in arbitration cases involving interference with management <span id="page_2000"></span>rights is to determine whether the arbitrator's <span class="Italic">interpretation</span> of a negotiated provision excessively interferes with a management right.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For reasons expressed in my dissents in the <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP (DOJ, BOP)</span>[1] and <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Complex, Lompoc, California (BOP, Lompoc)</span>[2] cases, and contrary to the majority's decision, the abrogation test is the appropriate test to determine whether the Arbitrator's award is contrary to law by impermissibly affecting a management right.[3] By failing to apply the Authority's abrogation test, the majority "disregard[s] the [parties'] assessment at the bargaining table of benefits and burdens, and appl[ies] its new [excessive-interference] test to summarily invalidate contract provisions accurately interpreted and applied by an arbitrator."[4]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, for reasons stated in my dissent in <span class="Italic">BOP, Lompoc</span>, the majority acts arbitrarily by using a "lopsided"[5] version of the Authority's well-established "excessive-interference" test to determine that the award impermissibly affects management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute).[6] The Authority's established "excessive-interference" test, approved by the courts and still employed by the majority in negotiability cases, balances a provision's or a proposal's benefits to employees against the provision's or proposal's burden on the agency's exercise of its management rights. Where the benefits outweigh the burdens, the matter does not impermissibly affect a management right, and is enforceable as an agreed-upon contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;70 FLRA at 600 (Dissenting Opinion of Member DuBester).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b). Contract provisions negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) are an exception to management's rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a), and may affect those rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU</span>, 69 FLRA 355, 358 (2016) (quoting <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-32 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>)) (The Authority makes an excessive-interference determination "by weighing 'the competing practical needs of employees and managers,' in order to ascertain whether the benefits to employees flowing from the proposal outweigh the proposal's burdens on the exercise of the management right involved.")); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the majority's lopsided version of this test, which I have called "excessive-interference-lite," is different. It does not employ balancing. As the majority clarifies, excessive-interference-lite "is not a cookie-cutter version of the 'balancing' excessive-interference test that the Authority applies...in the negotiability context.... In the context of reviewing management-rights challenges to arbitration awards, it does not matter whether a contract provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute."[9]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This concession by the majority, that it "does not matter" that a contract provision enforced by an arbitrator was properly negotiated and adopted under &#x00A7; 7106(b), confirms a fundamental flaw in the majority's new test. As I explained in <span class="Italic">BOP, Lompoc</span>, "[a]pplying the majority's analytical framework, a contract provision held to be fully negotiable in the negotiability context, through application of the original excessive-interference's balancing test, could nevertheless be held completely unenforceable in the arbitration context, through application of the majority's lopsided excessive-interference-lite test."[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;70 FLRA at 600 (Dissenting Opinion of Member DuBester).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This inconsistency is arbitrary and capricious.&#x2003;Inconsistently and without rationale, the majority uses one test, the original excessive-interference balancing test, to determine whether a contract proposal impermissibly affects management's rights. But then the majority uses a truncated version of that test, their lopsided excessive-interference-lite test, to resolve that same issue concerning that same proposal, now adopted by the parties and enforced by an arbitrator consistent with the proposal's meaning when declared negotiable.[11] Predictably, proposals determined to <span class="Italic">not</span> impermissibly affect management's rights because their benefits outweigh their burdens, <span class="Italic">will</span>, as contract provisions that an arbitrator enforces consistent with their negotiated meaning, be held to do just the opposite--impermissibly affect management's rights--when subjected to the majority's truncated test, which eliminates consideration of the benefits side of the balance.[12] "This is an irrational interpretation of the Statute, and is also inconsistent with a fundamental tenet of the collective-bargaining process: that parties should be able to rely on the enforceability of contract provisions they have properly bargained and adopted."[13]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Admittedly, in the last few months, I am often confused by my colleagues' disregard for longstanding labor-management relations principles. However, I want to assure my colleagues that--while they may fairly disagree with my perspective--based on over four decades of negotiating and mediating collective bargaining disputes, working as an arbitrator and resolving dozens of matters, and serving on the FLRA where I have participated in a couple thousand decisions, I am not at all confused by the distinction between determining what is "negotiable" and reviewing an arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Office of Chief Counsel, Wash., D.C. v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13, 20 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Although I disagree with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the particular circumstances of that case, I agree with the principle that the Authority should not apply two different tests to resolve, what is in reality, only a single issue; here, whether a proposal or provision impermissibly affects a management right. That is precisely what the majority does in this case, by applying the original excessive-interference test in the negotiability context, but their lopsided excessive-interference-lite test in the arbitration context.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BOP, Lompoc</span>, 70 FLRA at 600 (Dissenting Opinion of Member DuBester); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., SSA, Office of Disability Adjudication and Review, Region VI, New Orleans, La</span>., 67 FLRA 597, 602 (2014) ("Congress intended to foster contractual stability and repose. In this regard, courts and the Authority have held that the Statute embodies policies of 'promoting collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective[-]bargaining agreements,' and 'enabling parties to rely on the agreements that they reach, once they have reached them.'"

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the abrogation test, I would find that the award does not impermissibly affect management's right to assign work. The Arbitrator's interpretation and application of the memorandum of understanding (the MOU) and Article 15 does not preclude the Agency from exercising that right.[14] The Arbitrator found that under Article 15 and the MOU, an opt-out request is "available to involuntarily reassigned employees if qualified volunteers are available to replace them." He determined that under the parties' agreement, "qualified volunteers" means an employee at the same General Schedule (GS) grade level as the impacted employee. The Arbitrator also found that the Union had identified a "qualified volunteer" with sufficient "identity[-]theft experience" to work in the new subdivision, and that the volunteer worked at the grievant's GS grade level. The Arbitrator concluded, consequently, that the grievant could "opt out" of the reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla</span>., 65 FLRA 1040, 1044 (2011) (An award abrogates the exercise of a management right if the award precludes the agency from exercising the right.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the majority's misinterpretation of the award, the award does not require the Agency "to re-create the grievant's former position" that the realignment eliminated. Nor did the Union request this remedy. Further, the Agency acknowledges that if the opt-out request is granted, the "heads of office" would have to get together to determine a solution for an approved opt-out request under Article 15. Moreover, contrary to the majority, nothing in the award prevents the Agency from determining how to fill the realigned position after the grievant opts out, and whether to use the volunteer for that purpose. Read in context with the entire record, the award only requires the Agency to: (1) grant the <span id="page_2001"></span>grievant's opt-out request; (2) determine if a vacant position is available for the grievant; and (3) "[u]pon request...meet with local [Union] representatives concerning any disputes or issues related to opt-out opportunities for impacted employees" under the MOU's Section 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the award does not preclude the Agency from exercising its right to assign employees, it does not abrogate that right. I would therefore deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exception based on that right. Accordingly, I would deny the Agency's contrary-to-law exception, and address the Agency's remaining essence exception.</p>

The arbitrator was not required to reconstruct what management would have done had the contract not been violated (and the reconstruction requirement was not reimposed in 2018). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-27.html">65 FLRA 102</a> (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring in part), <span class="Italic">post</span>.

<p class="noindent">Note that the abrogation standard for agency head review of contract provisions was set aside in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 2014), discussed in Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-12-027.html#sec4-28">Management Rights Objection; Excessive Interference</a>."

<p class="noindent-1">I agree with my colleagues that the Union's proposal--that would "preclude management from disciplining and holding employees accountable for their work performance" that results from the commonsense changes to the rotation of duties that were implemented by management--excessively interferes with management's rights to direct and discipline employees and to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unlike my colleagues, however, I would take this opportunity to acknowledge the recent decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, IRS, Office of the Chief Counsel, Washington, D.C. v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) that calls into question the manner in which the Authority determines whether bargaining proposals and contract provisions impermissibly interfere with &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed below, I would embrace the excessive interference standard to determine whether a proposal or provision impermissibly interferes with any &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right regardless of whether the matter arises as an exception to an arbitrator's award, as a negotiability dispute involving proposals, or as the result of a negotiability appeal involving agency-head disapproval of contract provisions under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to my confirmation as a Member of the Authority (in November 2013), my colleagues suddenly, and unexpectedly, determined (entirely <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>) that they would no longer apply the excessive interference standard to determine whether an arbitrator's award impermissibly interferes with a management right but would instead re-adopt a standard--abrogation[3]--that was previously abandoned by the Authority in 2002.[4] In other words, my colleagues determined that an arbitrator's application of a contractual provision would no longer be found to be contrary to law unless it entirely "abrogate[d]--i.e., waive[d]" a management right.[5] Several months later in <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>, my colleagues expanded (again <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>) the application of the abrogation standard into the context of "negotiability appeal[s] involving agency-head disapproval of contract provisions" under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2)[6] even though the excessive interference standard had been in this context (and upheld by several federal courts) for thirty years.[7] But in the context of "negotiability cases involving proposals," my colleagues continued to apply the excessive interference standard.[8]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As this summary demonstrates, the Authority's precedent has shifted aimlessly between the application of the excessive interference and abrogation standards for nearly thirty years. As a consequence, agencies and unions alike have been unable to predict with any certainty under which standard they should argue negotiability cases and exceptions that challenge an arbitrator's award because it impermissibly interferes with a management right and under which standard their cases ultimately will be adjudicated.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA Indianapolis, Ind</span>., 66 FLRA 62, 65 (2011) (applying abrogation standard to deny agency's exceptions where agency argued "excessive interference"); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span>, 65 FLRA 290, 296 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting in part) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, on January 3, 2014, the court in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> delivered an unmistakable rebuke to the Authority for its "inconsistent interpretations" of these standards. The court specifically found that the Authority's recent adoption of the abrogation standard was "arbitrary and capricious" in the context of &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) agency-head review and "vacate[d] the Authority's decision" to expand the abrogation standard into that context. In a direct challenge to the Authority's rationale, the court found that "two identical provisions" affecting management rights "in precisely the same way" cannot be found to be appropriate or inappropriate depending "<span class="Italic">on the point</span> at which the agency asserts" its arguments (i.e., at the bargaining table, upon agency head review, or as the result of an arbitral award).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Besides the clear mandate of the court, there are many other reasons why it is imperative that the Authority bring clarity to this matter once and for all. But foremost is the reality that the ongoing shifting of standards by the Authority does not "facilitate[ ] and encourage[ ] the amicable settlement[ ] of disputes"[13] and does not bring any sense of finality or predictability to the parties that look to us for a fair adjudication of their goodfaith disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, it is imperative that the Authority finally adopt excessive interference as the sole standard by which we will determine whether a proposal or provision impermissibly interferes with &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights regardless of the "point at which [an] agency asserts [that an] arrangement is inappropriate." As the court acknowledged, it <span id="page_2002"></span>should not matter whether the matter arises in a negotiability dispute involving proposals, as the result of a negotiability appeal involving agency-head disapproval of contract provisions under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2), or as an exception to an arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first scenario, in this case, my colleagues "reject[ ]" the Union's request to expand the abrogation standard to negotiability cases involving proposals. I agree with my colleagues because the excessive interference standard has not only served the Authority well for thirty years, but it has been upheld consistently by federal courts in seven different federal circuits[18] and similar "interference" standards have been endorsed by numerous state courts to define the extent to which various collective bargaining arrangements may impinge on public employer-management rights.[19] To the contrary, no federal court has ever endorsed the abrogation standard, and the court in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> "vacate[d]" the Authority's attempt to insert that standard into negotiability appeals that involve agency-head disapproval under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) and tacitly endorsed excessive interference as the sole standard the Authority should apply.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, in view of the court's warning that--"two identical provisions" affecting management rights "in precisely the same way" cannot be found to be appropriate or inappropriate depending "<span class="Italic">on the point</span> at which the agency asserts" its arguments--and its observation--that "the Authority has given no indication that it plans to abandon the 'excessive interference' [standard]"--there is no sound justification to continue to apply the abrogation standard only when an agency challenges an arbitrator's award because it impermissibly interferes with a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fairness and utility of the abrogation standard has been challenged repeatedly.&#x2003;In 2002, Member Armendariz observed that "the Authority has never applied [the abrogation] standard in such a way to find that an award was deficient" and that "[s]uch a uniformly one-sided application effectively renders the test meaningless and removes all of its utility."[22] In 2011, Member Beck echoed these same concerns and noted, that after twenty years of applying abrogation in various contexts, the Authority still has never "found that a contract provision abrogates any management right; it just doesn't happen."[23] My research reaffirms that since <span class="Italic">NTEU 1</span> in 2011, the Authority still has yet to find that any proposal, any provision, or any application of contract provisions by any arbitrator abrogates any management right.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, I would use this case to embrace a single standard--excessive interference--for determining whether a proposal or provision impermissibly interferes with management rights. I believe that our failure to do so will lead only to further admonitions from federal courts that recently have criticized the reasoning employed by the Authority in several significant cases.[24] We cannot simply ignore, and fail to acknowledge, court decisions that we find to be inconvenient. And as I noted in my first opinion as a Member of the Authority, "in order for the federal labor-management relations community to contribute to the effective conduct of government...[t]he Authority needs to issue decisions that withstand judicial scrutiny."[25] Therefore, I am perplexed that my colleagues seem reluctant to give even a passing nod to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, it is time for the Authority to bring this matter to repose for the labor-management relations community and to endorse the only standard that is fundamentally fair and that has been affirmatively embraced by the federal courts.</p>
<p class="noindent">Past law, as Member Pizzella suggested, is not straightforward. There were twists and turns, advances and retreats, as FLRA membership changed. Readers examining decisions of FLRA will need to keep in mind when those decisions were issued and recognize that the legal tests then applied may not be the same as those now applied. We trace here (briefly) the development of the standards governing exceptions to awards based on management rights arguments. Patiently proceed through the evolution of the decisions and you will be rewarded by your arrival at the current state of the law--subject to change, of course, as FLRA membership changes. With changes in FLRA membership, the latest switchback is to the "excessive interference" standard in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a>, 398-406 (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1988 FLRA adopted an "excessive interference" test to assess the degree of interference to management rights permitted by an arbitration award enforcing a procedural or arrangements clause in a contract. That test was the same test that was employed to assess the negotiability of arrangements proposals and provisions under <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-13-059.html#sec5-60"><span class="Italic">KANG.</span></a>"] The 1988 decision of FLRA that applied the "excessive interference" test to arbitration awards was <span class="Italic">Washington Plate Printers Union Local 2 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 31 FLRA 1250, 1255-58 (1988), involving an award applying a contract article calling for 10 minutes of cleanup time before lunch, challenged by management as an impermissible infringement upon its right to assign work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the award is not deficient.&#x2003;The award enforces a provision of the parties' agreement which mitigates the adverse effect on employees of the unclean and potentially unhealthful conditions inherent in their work as printers. We conclude that Article VIII, Section 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Therefore, the Agency's exceptions must be denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency correctly states that under the Statute and Authority precedent, provisions which prescribe time periods for the performance of specific duties interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Overseas Education Association and U.S. Department of Defense Dependents Schools,</span> 28 FLRA 700 (1987) (proposal 2), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. Overseas Education Association, Inc. v. FLRA,</span> No. 87-1468 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 8, 1987). In <span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau,</span> the Authority found that a proposal which set aside a time period for personal cleanup interfered with management's right to assign work because it precluded the agency from assigning other duties to employees during that time period. 26 FLRA at 516. In the case now before us, Article VIII, Section 3 requires the Agency to set aside a time period of a specified length for the sole purpose of employee cleanup. Therefore, consistent with the decision in <span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau</span>, we find, contrary to the Arbitrator, that Article VIII, Section 3 interferes with the Agency's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This finding does not, however, end our inquiry. The Union claims that Article VIII, Section 3 constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). Under section 7106(b)(3), a provision which interferes with a management right may nevertheless be negotiable and enforceable by an arbitrator as an appropriate arrangement if it does not excessively interfere with that right. We find that Article VIII, Section 3 is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) and, thus, was properly enforced by the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 284 and Department of the Navy, Naval Air Technical Training Center, Lakehurst, New Jersey,</span> 29 FLRA 958 (1987) (Provision 1) (an arbitrator's award which simply enforces a properly negotiated appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) is not contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the test established in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986), in order to determine whether a provision constitutes a negotiable <span id="page_2003"></span>appropriate arrangement, we must first determine whether it is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees who may be adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. If we find that the provision is intended to be an "arrangement," we will then determine whether it is an "appropriate" arrangement, that is, whether it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found, and the Agency agrees, that the nature of the printers' work involves constant exposure to toxic substances, particularly during the pre-lunch press shutdown. The exposure to toxic substances is a direct result of the Agency's assignment of printing duties to the employees. Article VIII, Section 3 mitigates the adverse effect on employees of exposure to those substances by providing them an opportunity to remove the substances from their hands and faces before eating. We find, therefore, that Article VIII, Section 3 is an "arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute for employees adversely affected by the assignment of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether Article VIII, Section 3 is an "appropriate" arrangement, we must determine whether it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work. In making that determination, we balance the benefit afforded employees by the provision against its effects on the exercise of the right. <span class="Italic">Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 24 FLRA at 31-34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The burden imposed on management by Article VIII, Section 3 is the loss of up to 10 minutes of worktime prior to the employees' lunch period. The employees, on the other hand, derive a health and safety benefit from being provided a period in which to clean up. The record indicates that employees are routinely exposed to toxic and hazardous substances. Exposure is particularly intense during press cleanup. As the Arbitrator found, personal cleanup is "absolutely required for minimal protection of the health of these employees" because there is "a clear and direct relationship between a careful wash-up" and prevention of the adverse consequences of contact with toxic substances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency agrees that personal cleanup after contact with toxic substances is "necessary for printers' health and safety, and is thus an activity which is a legitimate part of the workday. The Arbitrator found that the Agency not only requires printers to wash up before lunch but could discipline them if they fail to perform required personal cleanup. The Arbitrator also found that Article VIII, Section 3 was consistent with OSHA regulations regarding employee cleanup after contact with toxic and hazardous materials. In this connection, the record indicates that OSHA-mandated material safety data sheets which are posted in the printers' work area require thorough washing following skin contact with such materials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The findings of the Arbitrator and other evidence in the record establish that it is essential to the health and safety of the employees in this case that they be provided with a period of time in which to clean up prior to their lunch period in order that they may remove any of the toxic substances with which they have come in contact during their work.&#x2003;In our view, the record in this case supports the conclusion that the benefit to employees of the cleanup period provided by Article VIII, Section 3 outweighs the loss of worktime which would result. We find, therefore, that Article VIII, Section 3 of the parties' agreement does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work and is an enforceable appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly enforced Article VIII, Section 3 of the parties' agreement and that there is no basis for finding the award deficient on the grounds that it is inconsistent with section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;In light of our conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the Arbitrator's finding that Article VIII, Section 3 constituted one of the methods or means by which the Agency performed its work or the Union's contentions that the provision incorporates existing legal restrictions on the assignment of work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis permitted management two opportunities to raise the "excessive interference" argument: first, during negotiations through a negotiability appeal process involving a contract proposal; second, following formation of a contract, during the arbitration process through exceptions challenging application of the contract article.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1990, recognizing that there should be an analytical distinction between an arrangements provision tested under the "excessive interference" measure for a negotiability determination of a contract article and the subsequent enforcement of the contract article in arbitration, FLRA shifted to a standard that assessed whether that article, as applied, abrogated management rights, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-17 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Washington Plate Printers Union, Local No. 2. I.P.D.E.U. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 31 FLRA 1250 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>), the Authority concluded that the collective bargaining agreement provision enforced by the arbitrator did not excessively interfere with management's right to assign work and constituted an enforceable appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). In reaching this conclusion based on the record presented, the Authority applied the test established in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>), to determine the negotiability of proposals under the Statute. Under the test established in <span class="Italic">KANG,</span> in order to determine whether a provision constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement, we must first determine whether it is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees who may be adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. If we find that the provision is intended to be an arrangement, we then determine whether it is an "appropriate" arrangement, that is, whether it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing,</span> 31 FLRA at 1256.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On reexamination, we conclude that in cases involving exceptions to arbitration awards such as the one before us, we should not apply the analytical framework formulated for cases involving negotiability decisions. We reach this conclusion because of the fundamental differences under the Statute between negotiation of, and arbitration concerning, a collective bargaining agreement. We now formulate an approach to these cases that will more fully carry out the Statute's purpose to facilitate and encourage the settlement of disputes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now hold that when an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a), we will examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will examine the award for abrogation because an award that abrogates, that is, precludes an agency from exercising, a management right inherently cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See, for example, National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23 and Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois,</span> 23 FLRA 753, 759-60 (1986). Consequently, such an award is contrary to law and is deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. Of course, if a contractual provision abrogates management's rights, any award enforcing that provision would also abrogate those rights and therefore would be contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute. Consequently, we will not find that the award is contrary to law, and we will deny the exception. If the arbitrator's interpretation does result in an abrogation of management's rights under section 7106(a), the award will be found deficient as contrary to law under section 7122(a) of the Statute; the contractual provision, susceptible to a different and sustainable interpretation by a different arbitrator, will not be affected. To the extent that Authority decisions have taken a different approach to these cases, they will no longer be followed. In this regard, we specifically overrule the approaches taken in <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Bureau of Engraving and Printing.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases such as these, we will not apply the test established in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> to determine whether the provision excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. This is a matter for the negotiation process under the Statute. Instead, we will determine whether a negotiated arrangement as enforced by an arbitrator abrogates management's rights. We expect that, as part of their negotiation process in reaching agreement on the provision, including it in their collective bargaining agreement, and subjecting the agreement to agency head review for legal sufficiency under section 7114(c) of the Statute, the parties will have assessed the effect of the provision on management's rights and the benefits to employees from the provision. Accordingly, when presented with exceptions to an arbitrator's award under section 7122(a) where an arrangement has been negotiated by the parties and enforced by an arbitrator in a way that does not abrogate management's rights, we will view the arrangement as appropriate for agreement and enforcement consistent with section 7106(b)(3). For the same reasons, when an arbitrator is presented with a provision that constitutes an arrangement, the arbitrator may not refuse to enforce the provision on the basis of a conflict with management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute unless the provision abrogates a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this approach to cases such as these more fully carries out the purposes of the Statute because it recognizes the fundamental differences under the Statute between the process for negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement and the process for enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement. The issue and determination of whether an arbitration award is deficient under section 7122(a)(1) is fundamentally different from the issue and determination of the extent <span id="page_2004"></span>of the duty to bargain under section 7117 of the Statute. Pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 7117 and the criteria established in Authority negotiability decisions for resolving appropriate arrangement issues, the Authority determines whether the duty to bargain under section 7117(a) extends to the matter proposed to be negotiated or whether the matter is outside the duty to bargain because the proposal excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute establishes an elaborate process for resolving allegations by an agency that the duty to bargain under the Statute does not extend to a matter proposed to be negotiated.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">KANG,</span> the Authority established a test to resolve questions of whether a matter was within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(3). In our view, the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis is unsuited to resolving matters related to the enforcement of such a provision that has already been agreed to by the parties because it unduly impinges on the role of arbitration and arbitrators under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In requiring parties to negotiate grievance procedures that terminate in binding arbitration and providing that the scope of review of arbitration awards would be very narrow, we believe that Congress fully expected arbitrators to enforce the collective bargaining agreements of Federal sector parties and the Authority to narrowly review those awards. By narrowly reviewing awards that enforce provisions of collective bargaining agreements that on their face are within the range of matters bargainable under the Statute, we facilitate and encourage the appropriate resolution of disputes under the Statute. By viewing an arrangement negotiated by the parties that does not abrogate a management right as appropriate under section 7106(b)(3), we encourage the resolution of duty-to-bargain issues as part of the negotiation process, which better facilitates their resolution. In addition, by concluding that an arbitrator properly enforced such a provision consistent with management's rights and by narrowly reviewing the award, we facilitate and encourage the final resolution of disputes by arbitration as intended by Congress. As the Authority has repeatedly recognized, the question of the interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement is a question solely for the arbitrator whose interpretation and application is what the parties bargained for. To the extent that the award concerns the construction of the agreement no basis can be provided for finding the award to be deficient. <span class="Italic">See, for example, United States Department of Labor (OSHA) and National Council of Field Labor Locals,</span> 34 FLRA 573, 575-76 (1990) (OSHA).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe that when the provision enforced by the arbitrator is within the range of matters that can be bargained, application of considerations that are part of the negotiation process in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards is unwarranted. Application of such considerations is not compelled by any of the principles of section 7106, including the principle that management rights are not waivable, and disserves the purposes and policies of the Statute. Section 7106 prohibits an agency from agreeing to a provision that abrogates management's rights. Consequently, enforcement of an arrangement negotiated by the parties that does not abrogate management's rights does not involve a question of waiver. We are committed to the Statute's provision for final and binding arbitration and its purpose of facilitating the resolution of disputes. These are best served by assuring that the decision of an arbitrator, selected by both parties to interpret and apply their collective bargaining agreement, will not be overridden on management rights grounds in order to relieve one party from the unwelcome result of that purposeful choice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, the arbitrator's interpretation and application must draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement and cannot simply reflect the arbitrator's own notions of industrial justice. <span class="Italic">Paperworkers v. Misco,</span> 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987). The arbitrator may not ignore the plain language of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, we encourage the parties to set forth plainly and precisely the arrangements which they have agreed to for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights. When a party establishes that the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement or evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement, we will find the award deficient, not because it is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute, but because the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA,</span> 34 FLRA at 575. Obviously, documentary evidence of the meaning and intent of the negotiated arrangement, such as bargaining history, can serve as support for such an exception and we encourage such documentation by the parties in this area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this approach in this case, we conclude that the Activity fails to establish that the award is contrary to section 7106(a) because it prevents management from assigning overtime unless management balances employee needs with operational needs. The Arbitrator interpreted Article 22, Section 8 to provide that normally an employee will not be directed to perform overtime when the employee recently has performed a significant amount of overtime and to require a reasoned judgment by management as to the relative weight to be accorded to operational needs and the employee's personal needs or physical state before directing overtime to be performed. The provision clearly constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work. Furthermore, the provision as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator requires only a reasoned judgment by management in balancing operational and employee needs before directing overtime to be performed. It clearly does not abrogate the exercise by management of its right to assign work. Therefore, the provision was enforceable by the Arbitrator consistent with management's rights. Consequently, we reject the Activity's contention that the Arbitrator was not empowered to prevent management from mandating overtime and from disciplining the grievant for refusing to work the overtime. The Arbitrator merely enforced an appropriate arrangement negotiated by the parties in determining that the efficiency of the Service was not promoted by suspending the grievant without regard to the proper balance between operational and employee needs as mandated by the agreement. Such enforcement provides no basis for finding the award contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute as claimed by the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, DMA, Aerospace Ctr., St. Louis and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 46 FLRA 298, 309 (1992), summarized FLRA review under <span class="Italic">Customs Serv.</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, in determining whether a negotiated provision abrogates the exercise of a management right, we do not apply the test established in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986), "to determine whether the provision excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 153</span>, 38 FLRA 74, 78 (1990). Instead, the test is whether the award "precludes an agency from exercising" management's rights. <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, in reviewing exceptions to an award that applies the analysis in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we will adopt the arbitrator's interpretation of the manner in which the negotiated provision is intended to operate unless that interpretation fails to draw its essence from the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 317. Where we accept the arbitrator's interpretation of a negotiated provision, we may nonetheless find the award contrary to the Statute under either of the following circumstances: 1) where the arbitrator has erroneously concluded, as a matter of law, that the negotiated provision abrogates the exercise of a management right; or 2) where the arbitrator has erroneously concluded, as a matter of law, that the negotiated provision does not abrogate the exercise of a management right. Thus, we will find an award deficient as contrary to law, despite our acceptance of the arbitrator's interpretation of the negotiated provision, if the award fails to enforce a provision that does not abrogate the exercise of a management right or if it enforces a provision that does abrogate a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent">Meanwhile, another <span class="Italic">BEP</span> decision addressed the remedial portion of an arbitrator's award that enforced an arrangements clause in the context of a challenge to a performance appraisal. The arbitrator was to undertake a two step analysis: first, apply the abrogation test and then, if a management right was improperly exercised under the contract, the arbitrator was to reconstruct what management would have done had the contract violation not occurred. FLRA provided the refined, two-step dance in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v53/53-021.html">53 FLRA 146</a>, 152-54 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">BEP</span>"), providing us with analysis of what FLRA styled Prongs 1 and 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n arbitration award that affects management rights under section 7106(a)(2) may provide a remedy only for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b).[8] Thus, under prong I, an arbitrator may cancel a performance rating only if management applied the established performance standards for that job element in violation of either an applicable law or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement on a section 7106(b) matter. In addition, an arbitrator may cancel a rating only if the violation affected that rating<span class="Italic">. Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1843 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 444, 448-49 (1995) (there must be a sufficient nexus between the remedy and the violation for which relief is provided). This revision applies the same approach to awards resolving performance appraisal grievances that are claimed to affect management rights that we apply to awards claimed to affect other management rights. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham</span>, <span class="Italic">Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 274 (1995) (finding no basis in the Statute to apply a different approach to management's right to discipline than is applied to other management rights under section 7106(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;When an arbitrator has enforced a provision of the parties' <span id="page_2005"></span>collective bargaining agreement that constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we apply the analysis of <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>), to determine whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B). Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, an arbitrator's enforcement of an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) is not contrary to management rights unless the enforcement would abrogate the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the revised analysis, agency regulations that do not constitute applicable laws, contract provisions that are not enforceable consistent with section 7106, and management's failure to apply established performance standards provide no basis for canceling a performance rating. Thus, the Authority will find an award deficient if the arbitrator canceled a performance rating solely because management failed to apply established performance standards; violated a regulation that does not constitute an applicable law; or violated an agreement provision that is not enforceable consistent with section 7106 of the Statute. Accordingly, we will no longer follow such decisions as <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, 509th Bombardment Wing, Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-111</span>, 41 FLRA 1035 (1991) (arbitrator canceled disputed performance ratings solely on the basis of the agency's failure to apply the established performance standards) and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, Army Garrison, Fort Richie, Maryland and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 115</span>, 43 FLRA 968 (1992) (arbitrator canceled the grievant's performance appraisal solely on the basis of the agency's failure to comply with an agency regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prong II of the analysis requires that the award must reflect a reconstruction of what management's appraisal of the grievant would have been if management had acted properly. Thus, an arbitrator who has properly canceled an appraisal or rating under the revised prong I may order management to change the grievant's rating only when the arbitrator is able to determine what management would have rated the grievant's performance if management had not violated applicable law or a contract provision concerning a section 7106(b) matter. An arbitrator does not properly reconstruct what management would have rated the grievant's performance when the arbitrator independently appraises or rates a grievant, or determines what management would have rated the grievant using standards different from those established by management.</p>
<p class="noindent">Matters remained unsettled. In <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 109 110 (2002), FLRA retreated to the "excessive interference" standard in reviewing an arbitration award involving a staffing practice impacting overtime opportunities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, in an initial award, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency had violated Article 27 by vacating posts for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's decisions to vacate posts were made for purposes of "do[ing] more with less. Applying Article 27, the Arbitrator ruled that "any decision to vacate posts for administrative convenience, whether it is tied to overtime specifically, to financial considerations generally, to needs created by training requirements, medical escort trips, sick leave, and vacations...or to the more amorphous balancing of considerations such as 'safety, security, budget and organizational objectives'" violates the pledge of Article 27 to lower inherent hazards to the lowest possible level. The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to cease and desist the practice of vacating posts to avoid the payment of overtime or for any other reason of administrative convenience, and directed the parties to submit arguments concerning additional remedies.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicable Standard </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth below, we find that the initial award and remedy award are deficient because they are contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> the Authority set forth the framework it uses to resolve exceptions which contend that an arbitrator's award is contrary to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. As applicable here, under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for the violation of a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106 (b) of the Statute. In examining under <span class="Italic">BEP</span> whether an award has enforced a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority has applied the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv.,</span> 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>). Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> the Authority examines the award to determine: (1) whether the provision of the collective bargaining agreement as interpreted by the arbitrator constitutes an arrangement; and (2) whether its enforcement is improper because it abrogates the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will continue to apply <span class="Italic">BEP</span> to determine whether an award has enforced a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). In doing so, we will also continue to examine whether the provision of the collective bargaining agreement, as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator, constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). However, in determining whether an arbitrator's enforcement of such a provision is authorized under the Statute, we will no longer apply the "abrogation" standard. Rather, consistent with the Authority's practice prior to <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> we will examine whether the contract provision, as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator, excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., The Washington Plate Printers Union Local No. 2, I.P.D.E.U</span>., 31 FLRA 1250, 1255-57 (1988) (the Authority applied the excessive interference test established in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (commonly referred to as <span class="Italic">KANG</span>) in determining that the provision of the agreement was an enforceable appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)).[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Chairman Cabaniss applies the excessive interference standard in such cases for the reasons stated in her concurring opinion. Member Armendariz applies the excessive interference standard for the reasons stated in his concurring opinion. Member Pope disagrees with the decision to apply the excessive interference standard and, for the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion, would apply the abrogation test.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accompanying the <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span> decision were two starkly different points of view from Chairman Armendariz and FLRA Member Pope concerning return to the "excessive interference" standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CONCURRING OPINION OF MEMBER ARMENDARIZ:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held, and with this decision today continues to hold, that an arbitrator's award which enforces a properly negotiated appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106 (b) (3) of the Statute is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. E.g., <span class="Italic">The Washington Plate Printers Union Local No. 2, I.P.D.E.U.,</span> 31 FLRA 1250, 1255-57 (1988) (Plate Printers); <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 19 FLRA 39, 41 (1985); <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin District,</span> 9 FLRA 672, 674 (1982). Although the Authority has consistently held that an arbitrator's award which enforces a properly negotiated appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a), it has applied different standards in determining whether an arbitrator is enforcing a properly negotiated appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to 1990, the Authority used the "excessive interference" standard in determining whether an arbitrator is enforcing a properly negotiated appropriate arrangement; that is, an award was not deficient if the arbitrator was enforcing an asserted &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) provision that did not "excessively interfere" with the exercise of management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. E.g., <span class="Italic">Plate Printers,</span> 31 FLRA at 1256-57.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv.,</span> 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), the Authority (of which I was a Member at the time) reexamined its approach in such cases and stated that it would no longer follow the "excessive interference" standard and instead would apply an "abrogation" standard. Under this standard, the Authority examined the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine whether it constituted an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and "if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right." <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> 37 FLRA at 314. Subsequently, I participated in various decisions that applied this standard in arbitration cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency in this case has specifically requested the Authority to replace the "abrogation" standard with the pre-existing "excessive interference" standard. In light of this request, and in view of recent Authority decisions discussing what the proper standard should be in determining whether an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), <span class="Italic">see, e.g., BOP, Guaynabo,</span> I have reexamined my views as to this matter. On reexamination, I conclude that a return to the "excessive interference" standard is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The abrogation standard as initially set forth in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> has lost any real meaning as it has been applied over the years. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> the Authority defined an award that abrogates the exercise of a management right as one that "precludes an agency from exercising" such a right. <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> 37 FLRA at 314. In every arbitration case in which the Authority has applied the abrogation standard (including those in which I participated), the Authority has determined that the enforcement of the contract provision did not abrogate the exercise of a management right. Stated otherwise, in the 12 years that the abrogation standard has been in existence, the Authority has never applied that standard in such a way to find that an award was deficient. Such a uniformly one-sided application effectively renders the test meaningless and removes all of its utility. The excessive interference standard allows an appropriate weighing of the relevant considerations in determining whether an award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> I will examine: (1) whether the provision of the collective bargaining agreement, as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator, constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; <span id="page_2006"></span>7106(b)(3); and (2) whether its enforcement by the arbitrator excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. In determining whether the provision constitutes an arrangement, I will examine whether the provision as applied by the arbitrator is sufficiently tailored. In determining whether its enforcement excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right, I will weigh the benefits afforded employees under the agreement provision as interpreted and enforced by the arbitrator against the intrusion on the exercise by management of its rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. If the provision as interpreted and enforced by the arbitrator constitutes an arrangement, and its enforcement by the arbitrator does not excessively interfere with a management right, I will find that the provision was enforced consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). Conversely, if the provision as interpreted and enforced by the arbitrator does not constitute an arrangement, or if its enforcement by the arbitrator excessively interferes with a management right, I will find that the provision was not enforced consistent with &#x00A7; 7106 (b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I emphasize that the focus of the inquiry is not on the text of the contractual provision itself, but rather on how an arbitrator interprets and enforces the provision in a specific factual context. In this regard, the parties are responsible for making their best arguments to arbitrators for how to resolve such contractual issues under <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> and arbitrators similarly have responsibilities to apply <span class="Italic">BEP</span> in a manner that addresses the relevant considerations discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, I also note that since the focus is on how an arbitrator interprets and enforces the provision in a specific factual context, it is quite possible that the same contractual provision may be interpreted and enforced differently by arbitrators and, similarly, may result in different outcomes with respect to the application of the excessive interference test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CONCURRING OPINION OF MEMBER POPE:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority today scraps over 12 years of precedent governing review of arbitration awards involving the exercise of management rights.&#x2003;It does so without fanfare and without a common rationale for reversing precedent. It also does so without even according the labor-management community the courtesy of an opportunity to comment on the change. The change--which will permit the Authority to reverse more arbitration awards--is not consistent with the Statute and, in both the short and long runs, is a disservice to the Federal labor-management relations program. While I agree that the initial award is deficient under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, I reach this conclusion because I would find that the award abrogates the exercise of the Agency's rights to assign work and determine internal security practices. I do not agree with the majority's decision to adopt and apply the excessive interference test in these circumstances. Thus, I write separately.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Use of the Authority's long-standing abrogation test in this case is both consistent with, and compelled by, the statutory scheme for resolving questions of: (1) the enforceability of contract provisions; and (2) the negotiability of contract proposals. In this regard, there is no question that contract provisions involving many matters are enforceable even though there was no obligation to bargain over them in the first place. Examples include contract provisions covering matters under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute and those covering matters that do not concern conditions of employment--while such provisions are not within the obligation to bargain under the Statute, they are fully enforceable once agreement on them has been reached. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Washington, D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 393, 395 (2000) (&#x00A7; 7106 (b)(D); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3302,</span> 52 FLRA 677, 680-83 (1996) (condition of employment). This recognizes the elemental principle that a proposal may be outside the duty to bargain but not contrary to law. Put differently, agencies may agree to a broader range of provisions than they are required to negotiate over under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is an outer limit to what may be agreed upon.&#x2003;In the context of management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a), this outer limit is that those rights may not be waived. As a result, a contract provision that waives a right under &#x00A7; 7106 (a) is contrary to law and is not enforceable. The abrogation test, which inquires whether a contract provision waives a management right, is therefore appropriate to determine whether a contract provision is unenforceable as contrary to law.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Any contention that the abrogation test is contrary to law because it accords deference to arbitrators' legal determinations is plainly wrong. The abrogation test accords no such deference. It is clear that the Authority reviews questions of law raised by an arbitrator's award and an exception to it <span class="Italic">de novo. NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citation omitted). The abrogation test simply provides the standard by which the Authority engages in <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service,</span> 37 FLRA at 316 (deference is accorded only to an arbitrator's contract interpretation). It appears, in this regard, that it is the Chairman (and not the Authority in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>) who conflates the standard for reviewing claims that an award fails to draw its essence from an agreement and the standards for reviewing claims that an award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority concludes that the excessive interference test is the appropriate test to apply in determining whether contract provisions are enforceable in arbitration under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. However, the excessive interference test does not determine whether a provision waives a management right and is, therefore, contrary to law under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute. The excessive interference test resolves a far different question: whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b) (3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding that the excessive interference test determines not only negotiability but also enforceability obliterates the distinction--what is within the obligation to bargain as opposed to what is contrary to law--between the two concepts. As such, it is squarely inconsistent with Authority precedent, set forth above, concerning permissive subjects of bargaining. It also is inconsistent with the Statute, which under &#x00A7; 7122 inquires only, as relevant here, whether an arbitration award is "contrary to law." Of course, applying the same test under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) to determine both negotiability and enforceability is undoubtedly simpler. But that doesn't make it right. The majority either fails to perceive, or ignores, this crucial point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is unclear to me whether the majority also fails to perceive, or simply ignores, the program ramifications of the change it imposes here. In this regard, it is undeniable that the change will result in the reversal of more awards and will do so in a lopsided manner. Just as importantly, this change will tilt the playing field not only in arbitration but also at the bargaining table, permitting agencies to gain concessions from unions by agreeing to provisions that the agencies can later claim excessively interfere with its rights in arbitration. In both cases, it is clear that the change will encourage the filing of more exceptions to arbitration awards with the Authority, thereby increasing litigation and reducing the finality of arbitration. As a result, even though management surely will benefit from the change, the Federal labor-management relations program surely will suffer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth in both <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Oklahoma City, Ok.,</span> 57 FLRA 158 (2001) and <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv.,</span> 37 FLRA 309 (1990), I would continue to apply the abrogation test in resolving whether a contract provision is enforceable in arbitration under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In reaching this conclusion, I clarify that, in my view, the abrogation test can and should be applied in a manner that recognizes the practical needs of agency management and preserves management's rights under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1782,</span> 702 F.2d at 1185 (Statute is designed, in part, "to reconcile collective bargaining with the distinctive needs of government employment"). That is, in order to find that an award abrogates the exercise of a management right, it is not necessary to conclude that the award eliminates all possible exercises of a right. This is not a mathematical exercise. Instead, the facts and circumstances of each case must be examined to determine whether, viewed in context, an award effectively abrogates the exercise of a right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that standard to the facts and circumstances presented here, I would find that Article 27, as interpreted and enforced by the Arbitrator, abrogates the Agency's rights to assign work and determine internal security practices because it leaves virtually no circumstance--whether related to work reasons, security reasons, or both--under which the Agency may leave posts vacant. <span class="Italic">Cf. BOP, Atlanta,</span> 57 FLRA at 407 (agency may vacate post for good reason or if the post has no contribution to the level of safety); <span class="Italic">BOP, Guaynabo,</span> 57 FLRA at 331 (agency may vacate posts in emergency situations). Accordingly, I would conclude that the provision is not enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, and the initial award fails prong 1 of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 3564, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-32.html">71 FLRA 183</a>, 185 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting) (following <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018), <span class="Italic">post</span>, returning the review of an award enforcing the disputed contract clause from an abrogation standard to an excessive interference standard: "In similar Federal Bureau of Prisons cases, the Authority has found that arbitration awards excessively interfered with management's right to assign work where the awards precluded the Agency from vacating shifts: solely 'for economic reasons'; except in 'emergency situations or for other good cause'; or for 'administrative convenience and without good reason.'" [footnotes omitted]).<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Then, with a change in membership, in 2010 FLRA switched back to the "abrogation" standard to evaluate awards challenged as violations of management rights, <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a>, 113-20 (2010) (Member Beck's concurring opinion printed below, following the majority opinion):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we deny the exceptions. In so doing, we modify the Authority's existing test for determining whether a contract provision is enforceable in arbitration under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.[2] Specifically, in this and future cases we will make that determination by applying an abrogation (waiver)--rather than an excessive interference--standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2007"></span>[2]&#x2003;The Authority has employed this test as "prong 1" of its analysis of arbitrators' awards claimed to impermissibly affect management rights set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 154 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). By decision issued today, the Authority is further modifying the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP </span>by eliminating the requirement, referred to in <span class="Italic">BEP </span>as "prong II," that a remedy "reconstruct" what agency management would have done if the agency had not violated law or its agreement with the exclusive representative. <span class="Italic">See FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 106-07 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>)). Although <span class="Italic">BEP </span>and its "prongs" will no longer govern disposition of exceptions alleging that an award is contrary to management rights, it remains appropriate, for the reasons discussed below, to inquire whether an award enforces a provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) or an applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties negotiated National Reasonable Accommodation Procedures (the agreement), which provide for a National Reasonable Accommodation Coordinator (national coordinator) and local coordinators who process employees' reasonable accommodation requests. Under the agreement, the national coordinator may not delegate the duty of reviewing medical information to a local coordinator without the affected employee's approval. The agreement was submitted for Agency-head review under &#x00A7; 7114 of the Statute. However, as the Agency did not complete the review within the thirty days allotted by &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3) of the Statute, the agreement went into effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the national coordinator transferred medical files to local coordinators in violation of the agreement.&#x2003;The parties did not resolve the grievance, and it was submitted to arbitration. The Arbitrator adopted the Union's formulation of the issue for resolution: "Whether the Agency violated the negotiated [agreement] by its [national coordinator] transferring confidential medical information of bargaining unit employees to a [local coordinator]? If so, what is the appropriate remedy?"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that, in negotiating the agreement, the parties had "voluntarily engaged in an appropriate arrangement...." (footnote omitted). The Arbitrator also stated that the parties had reached agreement on a permissive subject of bargaining. In addition, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency could not declare the agreement unlawful because the Agency head did not timely disapprove the agreement.<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the agreement by transferring medical files from the national coordinator to a local coordinator. Accordingly, the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and directed that the employees' files be returned to the national coordinator for processing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions of the Parties </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agency's Exceptions </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it may challenge the legality of the agreement even though the Agency-head review was untimely. The Agency also argues that the award is contrary to its right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. In this regard, the Agency contends that: (1) it determined that medical review should be performed by a local coordinator; (2) this determination is consistent with its right to assign work; and (3) any limitation on that right is unenforceable.<span class="Italic"> </span>Moreover, the Agency contends that the matter of delegating duties to local coordinators does not involve the "method and means" of performing work under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Finally, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator's finding that the parties reached an agreement on an appropriate arrangement is based on a nonfact.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Union's Opposition </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, as the Agency-head review was untimely, the Agency may not challenge the agreement in this proceeding. The Union also contends that it is not unlawful to engage in collective bargaining on proposals that limit management's statutory rights, including the right to assign work, if an agency so chooses. In this case, the Union contends that the Agency elected to negotiate with the Union on the roles of the coordinators involved in the processing of requests for reasonable accommodations. The Union also argues that the agreement concerns the method and means of providing reasonable accommodations, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), and an appropriate arrangement, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Finally, with respect to the Agency's nonfact exception, the Union states that the agreement constitutes an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency may challenge enforceability of the agreement. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3) of the Statute provides that, if an agency head does not approve or disapprove a collective bargaining agreement within thirty days after the date of its execution, then the agreement "shall take effect and shall be binding on the agency and the exclusive representative <span class="Italic">subject to the provisions of [the Statute]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.</span>" [5] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Accord Point Mugu Joint Council of NAGE, Local R12-33 &#x0026; NFFE, Local 1374</span>, 8 FLRA 389, 389 (1982). Because the Agency's disapproval was served on the Union more than thirty days after the agreement was executed, the agreement as negotiated and executed by the parties became effective and binding on the thirty-first day after execution--but did so "subject...to" the Statute and any applicable law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;This statutory language is one indication that, as discussed in more detail below, management rights may not be waived as part of the bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these principles, and with long-standing precedent, an agency may challenge the validity of a provision in an appropriate proceeding, such as this one. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 390; <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1858</span>, 4 FLRA 361, 362 (1980) (even after untimely disapproval, provisions found to violate "the Statute or any other applicable law, rule or regulation" are "deemed void and unenforceable[ ]"). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute charges the Authority with setting aside arbitration awards if they are "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1). There is no dispute that &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute constitutes a "law[ ]" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Marshals Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 708 F.2d 1417, 1421 n.5 (9th Cir. 1983) ("The management rights section of the [Statute] is a law affecting conditions of employment[ ]"). Thus, an arbitration award that is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 must be set aside. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 57 FLRA 158, 162 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City I</span>) ("management rights cannot be waived[ ]"), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 110 (2002) (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Armendariz concurring; then-Member Pope concurring as to result) (<span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City II</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Wash. Plate Printers Union, Local No. 2, I.P.D.E.U.</span>, 31 FLRA 1250, 1255-57 (1988)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the Agency may challenge the enforceability of the agreement--as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator in his award--on the basis of &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We agree with our concurring colleague that the statutory scheme, which permits an agency to challenge an agreement provision, raises concerns regarding the efficient conduct of collective bargaining. However, as these concerns arise from the Statute itself, it is up to Congress to address them. <span class="Italic">See Headquarters, NASA, Wash., D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 601, 619 (1995) ("Should Congress disagree with our conclusion, it can amend the laws in accordance with its policy objectives."), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 120 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 527 U.S. 229 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a party contends that an award is contrary to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted right. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard &#x0026; Intermediate Maint. Facility, Bremerton, Wash.</span>, 62 FLRA 4, 5 (2007). If the award affects the right, then, under the applicable legal framework, the Authority examines, as relevant here, whether the award provides a remedy for a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.[7] <span class="Italic">See FDIC, </span>65 FLRA at 104-05; <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., </span>37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990). In this regard, &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute provides that "<span class="Italic">[s]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">ubject to subsection (b)</span>..., nothing in this chapter shall affect" the exercise of management rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a) (emphasis added).[8] Accordingly, if an arbitrator's award affects a management right, then the award is contrary to law unless it enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;If an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, then the Authority may also consider whether the award enforces an "applicable law." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 63 FLRA 383, 385 (2009). As there is no claim that an applicable law is involved here, we do not discuss the matter further.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Further, Chairman Pope notes the Supreme Court's instruction that the words "nothing in this chapter" means "nothing in the entire" Statute, including grievance arbitration under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922, 928 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award affects the Agency's right to assign work. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work <span id="page_2008"></span>assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 558 (1999) (citation omitted). In addition, precluding the assignment of particular functions to particular individuals or positions affects the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 181-82 (1994) (Member Armendariz dissenting as to other matters).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the parties' agreement, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, the Agency may not assign to local coordinators certain of the processing functions for some employees' reasonable-accommodation requests, without the employees' prior consent. Thus, the award affects management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The Union claims, and the Arbitrator concluded, that the parties agreed to an appropriate arrangement for employees seeking reasonable accommodations. Applying <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review to the Arbitrator's legal conclusion, we assess whether, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, the parties' agreement is enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The agreement is enforceable because it was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Authority assesses whether it ameliorates the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Penitentiary, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 57 FLRA 406, 410 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Pen.</span>). Here, the agreement, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, limits the officials who may access the medical information of employees seeking reasonable accommodations, unless an employee consents to greater information sharing. By requiring the Agency to seek an employee's permission before transferring medical files from the national coordinator to a local coordinator, the agreement ensures that an employee's medical information is kept confidential to the greatest extent practicable. In this regard, the Authority has previously recognized:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[E]mployees have significant privacy interests in their medical records. Medical records, by their very nature, contain sensitive information about employees' medical history, and could reveal highly personal data about employees' physical, emotional, and mental conditions.... [T]he release of medical records...without the consent of the employees[ ] would result in a clear invasion of the employees' personal privacy[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1020</span>, 47 FLRA 258, 268 (1993). Accordingly, the agreement, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, ameliorates the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of management's right to assign the work of reviewing medical files.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the agreement is not an arrangement because the award does not enforce a provision that is tailored to benefit employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.&#x2003;However, because an arbitration award necessarily applies an agreement provision to actual, aggrieved parties, arbitration awards are inherently tailored to adversely affected employees, and the Authority does not conduct a tailoring analysis in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Pen.</span>, 57 FLRA at 410 n.5 (tailoring is part of the determination as to whether an arrangement is within the <span class="Italic">duty to bargain</span>, not whether "an agreed-upon [provision,] incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement[,] is <span class="Italic">enforceable </span>as negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)"). Therefore, the Agency's assertion provides no basis for finding that the award does not enforce an arrangement.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;We note that, in some arbitration decisions, the Authority has referenced tailoring in determining whether a provision is enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, St. Cloud VA Med. Ctr., St. Cloud, Minn.</span>, 62 FLRA 508, 510-11 (2008); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office</span>, 60 FLRA 839, 842 (2005); <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 60 FLRA 576, 579 (2005) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring; then-Member Pope dissenting as to other matters). However, the <span class="Italic">dicta</span> in these cases merely recognized that awards necessarily tailor relief to the harms suffered by adversely affected employees; none of the decisions set aside an award for failing to satisfy a tailoring analysis. <span class="Italic">Cf. NTEU, Chapter 207</span>, 60 FLRA 731, 735 (2005) ("<span class="Italic">As applied to the grievant</span>, [the provision] was a <span class="Italic">properly tailored arrangement </span>that did not excessively interfere with management's rights." (Emphases added.)). Insofar as these decisions may be interpreted as requiring a tailoring analysis, they will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's current standard for reviewing arbitral enforcement of provisions allegedly negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority determines whether an arrangement is "appropriate" by applying an excessive interference test. <span class="Italic">See BOP, Oklahoma City II</span>, 58 FLRA at 110. A provision excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the burdens on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 111. This is consistent with the test that the Authority applies in the negotiability context. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Indep. Labor, Local 7</span>, 64 FLRA 1194, 1197 (2010) (<span class="Italic">NAIL</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case provides an opportunity for the Authority to reexamine whether "excessive interference" is the appropriate standard to use in proceedings reviewing arbitration awards. On reexamination, we find, for the following reasons, that it is more appropriate to assess whether a contract provision, as interpreted and applied by an arbitrator, "abrogates"--i.e., waives--management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. In so doing, we return to a standard adopted by the Authority twenty years ago. In particular, in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>), the Authority established abrogation as the standard to be used in the arbitration context. The Authority acknowledged that the abrogation standard differed from the excessive interference standard that the Authority applies in the negotiability context. In deciding that a different framework was warranted in reviewing arbitration awards, the Authority stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We expect that, as part of their negotiation process in reaching agreement on the provision, including it in their collective bargaining agreement, and subjecting the agreement to agency head review for legal sufficiency under [&#x00A7;] 7114(c) of the Statute, the parties will have assessed the effect of the provision on management's rights and the benefits to employees from the provision....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In our view, [the abrogation] approach to cases...more fully carries out the purposes of the Statute because it recognizes the fundamental differences under the Statute between the process for negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement and the process for enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement. The issue and determination of whether an arbitration award is deficient under [&#x00A7;] 7122(a)(1) is fundamentally different from the issue and determination of the extent of the duty to bargain under [&#x00A7;] 7117 of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314-15.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority acknowledged in <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>that there is an outer limit to what the parties may permissibly negotiate. In this regard, the Authority stated that "management rights are not waivable[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 316. However, the Authority found that "enforcement of an arrangement negotiated by the parties that does not abrogate management's rights does not involve a question of waiver." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Thus, the Authority found that if, as interpreted and applied by an arbitrator, an arrangement did not abrogate a management right, then the arrangement was appropriate--i.e., enforceable--and an arbitration award enforcing the provision would not be set aside by the Authority as contrary to &#x00A7; 7106. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 317.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City II</span>, 58 FLRA at 110, the Authority reversed <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. However, the majority in <span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City II </span>lacked a common rationale for doing so. In this regard, Chairman Cabaniss relied primarily on a finding that the Statute does not permit the use of one &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) standard in the negotiability context and a different standard in the arbitration context. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 113. Member Armendariz, by contrast, relied primarily on a finding that the Authority had not found an award to be deficient on abrogation grounds and, thus, application of the test had "effectively render[ed] the test meaningless and remove[ed] all of its utility." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 115.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the rationale in <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>more persuasive than the separate rationales in <span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City II</span>. In so finding, we begin with the plain wording of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, N. Cent. Civilian Pers. Operation Ctr., Rock Island, Ill.</span>, 59 FLRA 296, 301 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). In this regard, neither &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) nor any other provision of the Statute defines the standard to be used in determining whether an award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 and, as a result, contrary to law under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1). Thus, the Statute does not expressly preclude the Authority from distinguishing between the standards used to determine whether a matter is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and the standard used to determine whether an award is contrary to law under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as discussed in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the negotiability and arbitration contexts are different in ways that warrant different analyses. In the negotiability context, where parties disagree over whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), it is necessary that <span class="Italic">the Authority balance </span>the competing burdens on management's rights against the benefits provided employees. <span class="Italic">See NAIL</span>, 64 FLRA at 1197. By contrast, in the arbitration context, bargaining has concluded and it is reasonable to conclude that the <span class="Italic">parties have balanced </span>the burdens and benefits themselves. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City I</span>, 57 FLRA at 162:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">parties should assess during bargaining the effect of the provision on management's rights and the benefits to employees from the provision. In other words, employers and unions should determine, through the collective bargaining process, what provisions best fit their working conditions and what arrangements are "appropriate." Thus, [the abrogation standard] reflects a justifiable reluctance on the part of the Authority to substitute its judgment on the wisdom of bargaining, or the merits of particular terms, for that of the parties who have reached agreement on the contract provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2009"></span>Moreover, it is beyond dispute that many matters that are not within the duty to bargain are nevertheless not contrary to law. For example, an agency has no statutory duty to bargain over a matter encompassed by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Nevertheless, once agreement has been reached over such a matter, it may not be disapproved by an agency head under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3) and is fully enforceable in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C., </span>56 FLRA 393, 395 (2000). Likewise, although there is no duty to bargain over matters that do not concern conditions of employment, agreements reached on those matters are fully enforceable. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3302</span>, 52 FLRA 677, 680-83 (1996). Thus, the Statute recognizes that agency management is permitted to agree to a broader range of matters than those strictly within its duty to bargain. No basis is provided to conclude that the situation is any different when management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are involved. Accordingly, short of waiver, agency management is permitted to agree to proposals affecting its management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, deference to parties' bargaining choices is consistent with the statutory "policies of: (1) promoting collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements; and (2) enabling parties to rely on the agreements that they reach, once they have reached them." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 156, 158 (2009) (Member Beck dissenting). Particularly after over thirty years' experience under the Statute, it is proper and reasonable to respect the choices and agreements made by the parties at the bargaining table.[10]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;We therefore find the parties' agreement to a particular provision a relevant consideration in assessing whether the provision, as construed and applied by an arbitrator, constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). However, because management rights may not be waived in collective bargaining, we are not able to join our concurring colleague in finding that the parties' agreement should be treated as a binding concession by the agency that the provision is a permissible limitation on management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See </span>Concurring Opinion at 12. Nevertheless, as stated previously, we agree with the concurrence that by permitting an agency to challenge a provision after agreement, the statutory scheme raises concerns regarding the efficient conduct of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, in resolving exceptions to arbitration awards involving contract provisions alleged to be enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we will assess whether the arrangement abrogates--i.e., waives--management rights. We will no longer apply an excessive-interference standard, and <span class="Italic">BOP, Oklahoma City II </span>and other Authority decisions that have applied that standard in arbitration will no longer be followed.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We note that our analysis calls into question whether abrogation also should be the standard applied in negotiability cases involving contract provisions (where agreement has been reached and subsequently disapproved), rather than proposals. <span class="Italic">See BOP, Oklahoma City I</span>, 57 FLRA at 162 ("it appears appropriate to reexamine at the first opportunity the application of the excessive interference standard in cases where a provision has been disapproved under &#x00A7; 7114(c)"). However, as that issue is not raised here, we leave it for another day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the abrogation standard here, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, the agreement limits the officials who may access the medical information of employees seeking reasonable accommodations, unless an employee consents to greater information sharing. Specifically, the agreement ensures that, upon an employee's request, only the national coordinator will have access to the employee's full medical file, unless the employee thereafter consents to further dissemination. However, the Agency is incorrect in asserting that, under the agreement, local coordinators cannot assist in developing reasonable accommodations. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that, although there are "limit[s]" on the national coordinator's ability to share confidential medical information, the national coordinator is permitted to share with local coordinators or supervisors "the 'functional limitation' an employee faces, if the information is needed to make a decision" regarding a reasonable-accommodation request. Moreover, the agreement limits the national coordinator's ability to disclose certain employee medical information only where an employee requests such protection. Thus, the agreement will not necessarily preclude disclosure of employee medical records to local coordinators in all cases. The agreed-upon arrangement preserves the Agency's "right to request, obtain[,] and evaluate medical information in order to make a determination whether the employee qualifies for a [reasonable accommodation]."<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we find that the agreement does not abrogate the Agency's right to assign work. Thus, the agreement is enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Because we have found that the award properly enforces an appropriate arrangement, it is unnecessary to address the award's alternative finding that the agreement resulted from negotiations on a permissive subject of bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)--namely, the methods or means of performing work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is not based on a nonfact.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's finding that the parties reached an agreement on an appropriate arrangement is based on a nonfact. An arbitrator's conclusion that is based on an interpretation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement does not constitute a fact that can be challenged as a nonfact. <span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 50 FLRA 88, 92 (1995). In finding that provisions of the parties' agreement constitute an appropriate arrangement, the Arbitrator interpreted and applied the language of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See </span>Award at 14 ("The grievance is sustained...[because the] Agency[ ]...violated the [agreement]...."). Thus, the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement as an appropriate arrangement cannot be challenged as a nonfact. Therefore, we deny the Agency's nonfact exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Member Beck, Concurring:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I join Chairman Pope and Member DuBester in concluding that the Agency's exceptions should be denied. I also applaud my colleagues' move to abandon the "excessive interference" standard for assessing whether a contract provision that is being enforced by an arbitrator violates management's rights. Where I break ranks with my colleagues, however, is at their belief that we should engage in <span class="Italic">any </span>assessment of whether a contract provision that is being enforced by an arbitrator violates management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The design of our Statute indicates that Congress intended for the evaluation of whether a given contract proposal impermissibly interferes with management rights to occur at the collective bargaining stage of the parties' labor relations--not at the much later stage where the proposal has been adopted by the parties as a binding contract provision and arbitration about that provision has occurred. Once a proposal has been agreed to and has become a binding contract provision, the time for arguments about management's rights has passed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Statute sets forth, at &#x00A7; 7106(a), certain critical management functions that are reserved to agency management (e.g., making determinations about budget, internal security, and the assignment of work). These are collectively known as "management rights." At the same time, at &#x00A7; 7106(b), the Statute unequivocally provides that an agency may agree to limitations on these management rights. The Statute expressly makes the management rights outlined in &#x00A7; 7106(a) "subject to" limitations that are negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b). Further, &#x00A7; 7106(b) tells us that "nothing" about &#x00A7; 7106(a) shall preclude the parties from negotiating limitations on management rights as described in &#x00A7; 7106(b). Reading &#x00A7; 7106 as a whole, one must conclude that Congress deemed the preservation of management rights to be important, and that it deemed the parties' freedom to negotiate limitations on these rights to be at least as important.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our Statute also makes clear as crystal that management need not agree to impermissible limitations on its &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights. When confronted with a collective bargaining proposal that, if implemented and enforced, would unduly infringe on management rights, agency negotiators may declare such a proposal to be non-negotiable. Whether the proposal is negotiable--that is, whether it is or is not a permissible limitation on management rights--then becomes a question to be resolved by the Authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E), 7117(c). In addition, even if agency negotiators fail to raise negotiability objections during bargaining and tentatively agree to a union's proposal, the proposal may still be rejected as a result of agency head review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply put, our Statute provides Federal agencies with ample opportunity to challenge a contract proposal based on its perceived interference with &#x00A7; 7106(a) management rights <span class="Italic">before </span>such a proposal becomes a binding contract provision. Agencies are well aware that, if they do not reject a proposal at the bargaining table or through the mechanism of agency head review, the proposal "shall take effect and shall be binding." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I presume that Federal agencies do not heedlessly agree to include in their collective bargaining agreements provisions that, if enforced in a reasonably foreseeable fashion, would impermissibly interfere with their management rights. As my colleagues correctly assert, once bargaining has taken place and a particular contract provision has been adopted, "it is reasonable to conclude that the <span class="Italic">parties have balanced </span>the burdens and benefits themselves." Majority at 8 (emphasis in original). By agreeing to include in its collective bargaining agreement a provision that affects the management rights described in &#x00A7; 7106(a), the agency concedes that the provision is a permissible limitation on those rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, once a contractual dispute has progressed to arbitration and the arbitrator has enforced a contract provision that was accepted <span id="page_2010"></span>by the agency as a permissible limitation on its management rights, the pertinent question is not whether the provision itself is an appropriate arrangement nor whether it excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right. Rather, at that point, the question is simply whether the remedy directed by the arbitrator enforces the provision in a reasonable and reasonably foreseeable fashion--in other words, whether the remedy draws its essence from the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">My colleagues note that, even after a proposal has been agreed to and has become a binding contractual provision, it remains "subject to the provisions of [the Statute]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3). Therefore, they conclude, "an arbitration award that is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 must be set aside." I agree with this proposition. When an arbitral remedy affecting management rights is not properly derived from the contract provision that is being enforced, it "imposes a constraint on management rights that was not agreed to by the parties" and will be set aside. <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 107 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 107 n.6. Thus, we ensure that a contract provision remains "subject to" the Statute by vacating an arbitral remedy that impermissibly interferes with management rights protected by &#x00A7; 7106(a) because it strays from the permissible limitation on management rights that the agency agreed to pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I join in my colleagues' stated desire to show "deference to the parties bargaining choices" and I concur that "it is proper and reasonable to respect the choices and agreements made by the parties at the bargaining table." However, enabling parties, after the fact, to challenge as illegal contract provisions to which they voluntarily agreed does not reflect such deference and respect. And it profoundly undermines a principal goal of our Statute, which is "to provide the parties to [a collective bargaining] agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 59 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To allow an agency to challenge the propriety of a given proposal under &#x00A7; 7106 <span class="Italic">during </span>collective bargaining is consistent with Congress' mandate that our Statute "be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b). To allow an agency to mount a challenge under &#x00A7; 7106 <span class="Italic">after </span>the agency has agreed to the provision and <span class="Italic">after </span>an arbitrator has issued an award enforcing that provision can hardly be considered effective or efficient.</p>

When evaluating exceptions asserting that an award is contrary to a governing agency rule or regulation, the Authority will determine whether the award is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The point of the decisions starting with the 1988 <span class="Italic">BEP</span> decision was that if management rights are violated, the arbitration award will be set aside as contrary to law, with two significant exceptions. First, as explained in <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> an arbitration award will be sustained if it provides a remedy for a violation of applicable law in accordance with 5 USC 7106(a)(2) (requiring that management officials act "in accordance with applicable laws"). Second, when appropriate arrangements (or procedural) bargaining leads to clauses that are negotiable despite their interference with management rights, arbitrators may issue awards that enforce those provisions. The amount of interference with management rights tolerated by FLRA varied. Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 317 (1990), the question was whether the contractual provision, as applied by the arbitrator, abrogated the exercise of a management right. Under more recent guidance, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 111, 115-17 (2002), the determining factor was whether the contract provision, as applied, excessively interferes with the management right. Starting in 2010, FLRA returned to an abrogation standard of review, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a>, 113-20 (2010), and then switched back to an excessive interference standard in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018). When an arbitrator directed a remedy for a violation of "applicable law" or a negotiated arrangement or procedure, the remedy was then examined. According to the analysis of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v53/53-021.html">53 FLRA 146</a>, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>), under Prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test, FLRA considered whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. If the award provided that remedy, the Authority would find that the award satisfied prong I of the framework and it then addressed Prong II. Under Prong II, FLRA considered whether the arbitrator's remedy reflected a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. If the remedy reflected that reconstruction, FLRA determined that the award satisfied prong II. Under the more recent analysis of <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-020.html">65 FLRA 102</a> (2010), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">BEP</span> Prong II was dropped; now, when an arbitrator finds that a contract provision was violated, the arbitrator is free to construct a remedy that is "reasonably related to the negotiated provisions at issue and the harm being remedied." The 2018 decisions earlier discussed suggest an element of "proportionality." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a>, 398-406 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The arbitrator need not attempt to reconstruct what management would have done had the contract not been violated.</p>
<p class="noindent">To be found deficient on the basis of management rights exceptions, there should be a reasonably apparent and direct violation of the right claimed by the agency. That an arbitrator finds management not to have adhered to a contract provision, resulting in a remedy for an employee, does not mean that management's rights have been violated because management will then be required to change its organization, budget, or the number and types of personnel it employs in order to avoid future violations of the contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Southeast Region and NTEU Chap. 6</span>, 46 FLRA 572, 576 (1992). Assuming a violation of a management right, the union's opposition to the exceptions filed by the agency should demonstrate to FLRA that the disputed contract clause is a negotiable procedure or appropriate arrangement. If the union offers no opposition to the exceptions, and if no similar clause has been construed through its prior decisions, FLRA may find that the award violates management rights, e.g., the right to assign work, and set aside the award because the disputed clause has not been demonstrated to be a negotiable procedure or arrangement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Southeastern Program Serv. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2206</span>, 55 FLRA 320, 322 (1999). If, under earlier law, management argued that an award excessively interfered with its right to assign work, negating the union's argument that the award enforced an appropriate contractual arrangement, management was to show how its right to assign work was specifically burdened.<span class="Italic"> See DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 61 FLRA 113, 116 (2005); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Beaumont and AFGE Local 1010</span>, 62 FLRA 100 (2007) (management demonstrated award excessively interfered with right to assign work by requiring that management amend employee's position description every time it wished to assign duty not already contained in position description; burden on management outweighed benefit to grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1990, many FLRA decisions, some discussed in the sections that follow, set aside awards that directly or indirectly enforced contract clauses in a manner that excessively interfered with management rights. Examples include: <span class="Italic">VAMC, Birmingham and AFGE Local 2207</span>, 34 FLRA 335, 341 (1990) (award that precluded management from assigning overtime work to part-time employees before work was offered for full-time workers); <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, AFLC Hq., AFLC/DPCE and AFGE Council 214</span>, 32 FLRA 261, 266 (1988) (contract provisions cannot be enforced that preclude management from assigning work by precluding reassignment of employees); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 23 FLRA 369, 371 (1986) (awarding overtime to an employee: it impeded management's right to determine qualifications necessary to perform work); <span class="Italic">Southwestern Power Admin. and IBEW Local 1002</span>, 22 FLRA 475, 477 (1986) (award in derogation of right to assign work when it precluded management from assigning unit work to supervisors); <span class="Italic">Defense Contract Admin.
