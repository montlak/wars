<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-283"><span class="space">5.</span> Burden of Proof</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2015 the Board added a regulation to define burdens of proof in USERRA cases and other appeals, 5 CFR 1201.57 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.57 <span class="Italic">Establishing jurisdiction in appeals not covered by &#x00A7; 1201.56; burden and degree of proof; scope of review.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicability</span>. This section applies to the following types of appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An individual right of action (IRA) appeal under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. 1221;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A request for corrective action under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA), 5 U.S.C. 3330a(d);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A request for corrective action under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4324, in which the appellant alleges discrimination or retaliation in violation of 38 U.S.C. 4311; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;An appeal under 5 CFR 353.304, in which an appellant alleges a failure to restore, improper restoration of, or failure to return following a leave of absence (denial of restoration appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters that must be supported by nonfrivolous allegations</span>. Except for proving exhaustion of a required statutory complaint process and standing to appeal (paragraphs (c)(1) and (3) of this section), in order to establish jurisdiction, an appellant who initiates an appeal covered by this section must make nonfrivolous allegations (as defined in &#x00A7; 1201.4(s)) with regard to the substantive jurisdictional elements applicable to the particular type of appeal he or she has initiated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters that must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence</span>. An appellant who initiates an appeal covered by this section has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence (as defined in &#x00A7; 1201.4(q)), on the following matters:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;When applicable, exhaustion of a statutory complaint process that is preliminary to an appeal to the Board;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Timeliness of an appeal under 5 CFR 1201.22;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Standing to appeal, when disputed by the agency or questioned by the Board. (An appellant has "standing" when he or she falls within the class of persons who may file an appeal under the law applicable to the appeal.); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The merits of an appeal, if the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction and was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Scope of the appeal</span>. Appeals covered by this section are limited in scope. With the exception of denial of restoration appeals, the Board will not consider matters described at 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2) in an appeal covered by this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Notice of jurisdictional, timeliness, and merits elements</span>. The administrative judge will provide notice to the parties of the specific jurisdictional, timeliness, and merits elements that apply in a particular appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional information</span>. For additional information on IRA appeals, the reader should consult 5 CFR part 1209. For additional information on VEOA appeals, the reader should consult 5 CFR part 1208, subparts A &#x0026; C. For additional information on USERRA appeals, the reader should consult 5 CFR part 1208, subparts A and B.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;For additional information on denial of restoration appeals, the reader should consult 5 CFR part 353, subparts A and C.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA encompasses discrimination claims--those involving assertions that military service led to denial of an employment benefit--and reemployment claims--those involving assertions that statutory reemployment rights were violated. A case may include both assertions of discrimination and denial of reemployment rights. The discrimination claim involves a tie between military service and the loss of an employment benefit--a motivational analysis. The distinction in burdens of proof for the these cases was explained, <span class="Italic">Rassenfoss v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RASSENFOSS_DAVID_O_CH_4324_13_0386_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1074162.pdf">121 MSPR 512</a>, 517 &#x00B6; 10, 2014 MSPB 68 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that, in addition to a discrimination claim, the appellant raised a reemployment claim under USERRA. A reemployment claim arises under USERRA when an employee claims that an agency has not met its obligations under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 following his absence from civilian employment to perform uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Clavin</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 5. Unlike discrimination cases, an individual's rights under USERRA's reemployment provisions do not depend on the motivation for an agency's action (or inaction), and the agency bears the burden of proving that it met its statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 6. Although the administrative judge concluded that the record did not support a finding that the agency violated the anti-discrimination provisions of USERRA, she did not address the question of whether the agency met its burden to prove that it met its reemployment obligations under USERRA. Rather, she stated that the Board has jurisdiction over appeals of any person alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of prior military service and that the appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that his military service was a substantial and motivating factor in the agency's decision to deny him a benefit of employment. Thus, she appears to have analyzed only whether the appellant met his burden to establish his discrimination claim.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the burden of proof in cases involving alleged violations of that provision differs from those in cases involving alleged violations of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311. In a USERRA appeal arising under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311, the appellant bears the burden of proving that his uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the action that he claims was retaliatory or otherwise improper; if he meets that burden, the agency can avoid liability by showing that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the appellant's performance of uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Wyatt v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While not raised by the appellant in his petition for review, we find that the administrative judge applied, in part, the wrong legal standard to the appellant's claims of discrimination and retaliation under USERRA. First, the administrative judge should not have applied the traditional burdens of proof and production under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as applied by the Board in <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, for analyzing discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. Instead, the administrative judge should have applied the "but for" legal standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, in considering the appellant's claim that the agency retaliated against him for filing two prior Board USERRA complaints, the administrative judge improperly applied the four-pronged test set forth in <span class="Italic">Warren</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, the appellant must establish that he engaged in protected activity; the accused officials knew of the protected activity; the actions under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 804 F.2d at 656.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be established by direct evidence or may be reasonably inferred from a variety of factors, including proximity in time between the employee's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the employee's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain employees compared to other employees with similar work records or offenses. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA standard for retaliation claims is set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(b) and 4311(c)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c) An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited...(2) under subsection (b), if the person's (A) action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (D) exercise of a right provided for in this chapter, is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person's enforcement action...or exercise of a right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these standards to the factual findings of the administrative judge as set forth in the initial decision, we find that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving, by preponderant evidence, that his military status was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to deny him "spot leave" or in its decision to deny him use of official agency time for volunteer work at the DOD. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013. Even if the appellant had met his initial burden, however, the evidence shows that the agency has met its burden of showing that it would have taken the same two actions for a valid reason, irrespective of the appellant's military status. As the administrative judge found, the testimony of the appellant's first- and second-line supervisors shows that his request for "spot leave" was, in actuality, a request that he be permitted to work through his lunch period and leave 1/2 hour early with no charge to leave. The testimony further established that agency policy provides that all administrative employees, including the appellant, are required to take 1/2 hour lunches at a fixed time between the hours of 11:00 <span class="small">A.M.</span> and 1:00 <span class="small">P.M.</span>, and are not permitted to work through their lunch period to leave early. Thus, the fact that the appellant was requesting leave in anticipation of his military duties was immaterial to the agency's action, as his position did not provide for the schedule modification that he was seeking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's supervisor further testified that he informed the appellant that he was free to participate in the DOD's ombudsman program, but that he would be not be permitted to use official agency time since the program was not under the agency's control and was not related to aviation safety or education. Despite the appellant's arguments that he was treated disparately in both of these situations, he failed to identify any similarly situated non-military employee who had been given the same benefits he claimed to have been denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant failed to meet his initial burden of proving that his prior USERRA activity was a motivating factor in any of the alleged actions enumerated in his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013. While the appellant did establish that his supervisors had some knowledge of his prior appeal, as the administrative judge noted, there is simply no evidence in the record that would demonstrate any motivation for either of them to engage in any retaliatory behavior against the appellant. The 2000 Board USERRA complaint, which concerned the correction of the calculation of the appellant's military and annual leave, was filed and settled while the appellant was working in Kansas City, and the appellant has not demonstrated that his supervisors, who work in St. Louis, had anything to do with the appeal. The appellant has suggested no legal basis from which to conclude that any of the alleged actions were a result of his prior USERRA Board complaints. In our view, his allegations amount to mere disagreement with agency policy concerning, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, workplace operations, employee training opportunities, compensation for "off-duty" travel, and the workday schedule of an administrative employee. The mere fact that those disagreements occurred after he had filed a USERRA complaint, and involved two supervisors who had some general knowledge of his prior case, is not sufficient to show that the USERRA activity was a motivating factor in the agency's actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a jurisdictional nutshell, <span class="Italic">Lee v. DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 256, 261-62 &#x00B6; 9 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may establish jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal by showing: (1) performance of duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) an allegation of a loss of a benefit of employment; and (3) an allegation that the benefit was lost due to the performance of duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">E.g., Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252 &#x00B6; 10 (2004).[5] An allegation that an employer took or failed to take certain actions based on an individual's military status or obligations in violation of USERRA constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation entitling the appellant to Board consideration of his claim. <span class="Italic">Id.; Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 9 (1999).<span class="Italic"></span> In their appeals, the appellants have submitted evidence and argument showing, and the agencies do not dispute, that they have performed duty in the uniformed service of the United States. The appellants also allege that they have lost a benefit of employment, i.e., military leave under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6323(a), due to their performance of that service, thus causing them to use annual leave, sick leave, or LWOP to perform military service. Therefore, we find that the Board has USERRA jurisdiction over these appeals. <span class="Italic">See Butterbaugh</span>, 336 F.3d at 1334-36; <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 490 &#x00B6; 7 (2002), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 336 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The formulation above is not a universal test for USERRA jurisdiction, but instead is simply the most appropriate way to state the jurisdictional elements relevant to the specific facts alleged by the appellants herein. Failure to meet element (1) above would not be a basis for dismissal when, for example, a person who had never performed uniformed service brought a USERRA appeal claiming retaliation by a federal employer for assisting someone else in exercising USERRA rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(b), 4324(b). Furthermore, elements (2) and (3) above describe just one kind of USERRA claim. There are many others, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, claims for denial of initial employment, denial of reemployment, denial of promotion, or denial of retention in employment, because of past uniformed service or a present obligation to perform such service, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), as well as claims of "discrimination in employment" or "adverse employment action" for exercising a USERRA right or assisting someone in exercising a USERRA right, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While this case was pending on review before the Board, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a precedential decision that construed the statutory burden of proving discrimination in employment on the basis of military service under USERRA, as set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit specifically rejected the use of the Title VII <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis in USERRA cases, finding that Congress in 1994 had adopted the "but-for" test as the standard of proof of discrimination or retaliation under USERRA and had cited, in the legislative history of USERRA, the procedures and allocations of burdens of proof for actions under the National Labor Relations Act as discussed by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Transportation Management Corp.,</span> 462 U.S. 393, 401, 103 S. Ct. 2469, 76 L. Ed.2d 667 (1983), <span class="Italic">modified by Office of Workers' Compensation v. Greenwich Collieries,</span> 512 U.S. 267, 114 S. Ct. 2251, 129 L.

The Federal Circuit noted that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Transportation Management</span> had adopted and approved the National Labor Relations Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Wright Line</span>, 251 NLRB 1083, 1089 (1980), <span class="Italic">enforced,</span> 662 F.2d 899 (1st Cir. 1981), and the Federal Circuit specifically applied this precedent to USERRA claims. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, "an employee making a USERRA claim of discrimination...bear[s] the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was a 'substantial or motivating factor' in the adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1013 (citation omitted). "If this requirement is met, the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that an employee may prove discriminatory motive or intent by either direct or circumstantial (indirect) evidence. <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1014. But, "[w]hen the employee has met this burden, the burden shifts to the employer to prove...that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced the employer to take the same adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In sum, under the "but-for" test, "in USERRA actions there must be an initial showing by the employee that military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action, upon which the agency must prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the action would have been taken despite the protected status." * <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_475"></span>[*]&#x2003;The Board previously held that if an appellant supports his claim indirectly by showing that an agency's discriminatory intent could be inferred from relevant circumstantial evidence, the AJ should apply analogous burdens of proof and production under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for analyzing discrimination claims based on circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 MSPR 1 &#x00B6; 13 (1999); <span class="Italic">Jasper v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 MSPR 367, 371 (1997); <span class="Italic">Duncan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record evidence regarding the appellant's USERRA claim raises some concern as to whether the administrative judge properly determined that the appellant failed to establish that his reserve obligation was a motivating factor in the agency's decision to stop processing his application. If the Board were to credit the appellant's version of the events, it is at least arguable that the appellant's unrebutted sworn statements regarding the agency recruiting official's actions upon learning of the appellant's ongoing obligations in the military reserves were sufficient to meet the appellant's burden of proving that his military status was a substantial or motivating factor in his nonselection. <span class="Italic">See Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 (1986) (a declaration subscribed as true under penalty of perjury, if uncontested, proves the facts it asserts); <span class="Italic">see also Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from such circumstantial evidence as temporal proximity between the appellant's military activity and the adverse employment action, inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the individual's military activity, and disparate treatment of certain individuals compared to others with similar work records).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The ultimate qualifications of an individual seeking a promotion are not determinative of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under USERRA. The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established if the appellant demonstrates that military service was a motivating or substantial factor in the agency action. The agency then must show that it would have taken the same action despite the appellant's protected status. The qualifications for the position sought relate to the agency's defensive case. <span class="Italic">See Becwar v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 115 MSPR 689, 693-94 &#x00B6; 7, 2011 MSPB 34 (2011). <span class="Italic">Becker v. VA</span>, 373 Fed. Appx. 54, 57-58 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employer engages in the conduct proscribed under &#x00A7; 4311(a) if the performance of service "is a motivating factor in the employer's action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1). In addition, an employer may not discriminate in employment against an employee because such employee "has taken action to enforce a protection afforded any person under [the USERRA]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 4311(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA claims are analyzed under a burden-shifting mechanism, where an employee making a claim under the Act "bears the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 571 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The employer, however, does not violate the Act if it can show "that the action would have been taken in the absence of such...service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1), (c)(2)(D); <span class="Italic">see also Erickson,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364 ("If the employee makes that <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the employer can avoid liability by demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that it would have taken the same action without regard to the employee's military service."). In other words, an employer only violates &#x00A7; 4311 "if it would not have taken the adverse employment action but for the employee's military service." <span class="Italic">Erickson,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364. Becker's claim against the Department of Veterans Affairs does not provide sufficient evidence to meet his initial burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, there is no evidence presented that Becker's military service was "a motivating factor" in the agency's decision. The Board relied on the agency's submission of declarations from the interviewing panel that all seven candidates were asked the same seven questions and evaluated under the same scale of 0-5. Also, each panel member declared that Becker's military service was not a factor in the panel's decision. Becker has presented no evidence disputing the panel members' declarations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, there is insufficient evidence that the DVA's decision not to offer the position to Becker was based on Becker's prior actions under the USERRA. Although during an EEO investigation an investigator discovered that the head of the Human Resources office notified management about Becker's actions, the Board did not find any evidence that this information was communicated to the members of the interviewing panel. Rather, the panel members' declarations indicated that Becker's prior actions were not considered in their decision making process. Becker, therefore, has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service or prior USERRA actions were a motivating factor in the agency's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Becker did not meet his "initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that his military service [or prior USERRA actions] was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action," we need not address whether the agency would have taken the same action regardless of Becker's service. <span class="Italic">See Erickson,</span> 571 F.3d at 1364.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence that neither Becker's military service nor his prior USERRA actions were "motivating factor[s]" in the agency's decision, this court affirms.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Mr. Kitts did not make an initial showing that his military status or obligations were at least a motivating or substantial factor in the Agency's decision to terminate him. As set out above, the Board found that the Agency's decision to terminate Mr. Kitts was made because Mr. Kitts lied on his employment application, and hid critical information while employed with the Agency. Furthermore, though Mr. Kitts advised the Agency that he may be mobilized on January 22, 2003, and then that he had received mobilization orders on January 24, 2003, this was after the decision had been made to remove him, and his January 24th email was not received until after his removal letter had been mailed. Thus, this court discerns that substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the decision to remove Mr. Kitts was made without his military status or obligations having any impact upon the decision to remove him.</p>
