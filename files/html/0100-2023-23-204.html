<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-199"><span class="space">b.</span> Good Faith Required; Bad Faith</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Parties should do what they can to ensure that contract obligations are met, <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 600, 602 (1982) (concerning an employment contract rather than a settlement agreement):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Every contract implies good faith and fair dealing between the parties to it, and a [duty] of cooperation on the part of both parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Voege v. American Sumatra Tobacco Corporation</span>, 241 F. Supp. 369 (D. Del. 1965). Contracts impose on the parties thereto a duty to do everything reasonably necessary to facilitate performance....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing a government contract dispute, <span class="Italic">Metcalf Constr. Co. v. United States</span>, 742 F.3d 984, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and enforcement." Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 205 (1981) ("Restatement"), quoted in <span class="Italic">Alabama v. North Carolina</span>, 120 S. Ct. 2295, 2312 (2010). Failure to fulfill that duty constitutes a breach of contract, as does failure to fulfill a duty "imposed by a promise stated in the agreement." Restatement &#x00A7; 235. We have long applied those principles to contracts with the federal government. <span class="Italic">E.g., Precision Pine &#x0026; Timber, Inc. v. United States</span>, 596 F.3d 817, 828 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Malone v. United States</span>, 849 F.2d 1441, 1445-46 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Identifying some acts as breaches of the duty, like "[s]ubterfuges and evasions," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1445, may require little reference to the particular contract. In general, though, "what that duty entails depends in part on what that contract promises (or disclaims)." <span class="Italic">Precision Pine</span>, 596 F.3d at 830. That is evident from repeated formulations that capture the duty's focus on "faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party" (Restatement &#x00A7; 205 cmt. a), which obviously depend on the contract's allocation of benefits and risks. "The covenant of good faith and fair dealing...imposes obligations on both contracting parties that include the duty not to interfere with the other party's <span class="Italic">performance</span> and not to act so as to destroy the <span class="Italic">reasonable expectations</span> of the other party regarding the <span class="Italic">fruits of the contract</span>." <span class="Italic">Centex Corp. v. United States</span>, 395 F.3d 1283, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (emphases added). "Both the duty not to hinder and the duty to cooperate are aspects of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing." <span class="Italic">Precision Pine</span>, 596 F.3d at 820 n.1. What is promised or disclaimed in a contract helps define what constitutes "lack of diligence and interference with or failure to cooperate in the other party's performance." <span class="Italic">Malone</span>, 849 F.2d at 1445. In short, while the implied duty exists because it is rarely possible to anticipate in contract language every possible action or omission by a party that undermines the bargain, the nature of that bargain is central to keeping the duty focused on "honoring the reasonable expectations created by the autonomous expressions of the contracting parties." <span class="Italic">Tymshare, Inc. v. Covell</span>, 727 F.2d 1145, 1152 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (per Scalia, J.).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation to implement a settlement term is not necessarily fully satisfied the moment it technically and facially places the employee in the position identified in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall v.

To establish a breach of the settlement agreement based on breach of its term requiring the parties to cooperate and communicate in good faith, it is the appellant's burden to show that the agency took retaliatory/harassing actions that, under the totality of the circumstances, amounted to an unjustified and substantial deprivation of rights as an incumbent of his position. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 324-25.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Among other things, the appellant asserts that the settlement agreement did not require him to submit back pay forms to the agency and that, if the forms were relevant to the case, the agency should have mailed them to his address of record, which it failed to do. Contrary to his assertions, the appellant was expressly required to cooperate in good faith to implement and to abide by the terms of the agreement, and therefore was implicitly obligated to submit the back pay forms necessary for the agency to process his back pay disbursement to enable the agency to make payment within 8 weeks of receiving the executed agreement. The record evidence demonstrates that, although the forms were delivered on February 9, 2011, to the appellant's Post Office Box--the address the appellant listed on his PS Form 8038--the appellant failed to return the completed forms until May 13, 2011. Further, it is undisputed that the agency issued payment within one month of receiving the completed forms from the appellant. Thus, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's own breach of the settlement agreement resulted in the agency's delay in paying back pay, and that the agency paid the appellant back pay in compliance with the terms of the agreement.</p>

Because the Claims Court's judgment was not based on the government undermining any specific promise of the 2007 agreement, we conclude that the judgment for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be sustained.</p>

Dep't of Transp.</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 321 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.2d 1023, 1023 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (table); <span class="Italic">Cook v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 671 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Good faith does not equate to perfection or even zealous pursuit of the goals of a settlement, as <span class="Italic">Greene v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 164, 168-69 (1998), explained, concerning a dispute over the adequacy of a medical document an appellant was required to produce under a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement, the agency promises to rescind and expunge the appellant's removal, "subject to the appellant meeting the above enumerated conditions of this agreement." In other words, if any of the enumerated conditions does not occur, the agency is not bound to reinstate the appellant<span class="Italic">. See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 224(d) (1979) (conditions may be cumulative so that performance will not become due unless all of them occur). The agency argues that the appellant failed to meet the conditions set forth in the first and second paragraphs of the agreement. Under paragraph 1, the appellant was required to produce medical certification from his physician that, with the use of a respirator or comparable device, the appellant would be able to safely perform the full duties of a mail processor. The certification was required to be produced "within 30 days after signing the agreement or within a timeframe mutually agreed to by the parties." Under paragraph 2, the appellant was required to produce certification from his physician that, with the use of a respirator or comparable device, the appellant would not sustain any injury in the performance of his duties as a mail processor. We agree that the appellant did not fulfill these prerequisites.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not submit any medical certification within 30 days after signing the agreement. The agreement was executed on May 30, 1997 and the first report by Dr. Margolis was dated July 31, 1997. There is no evidence that the parties agreed to an extension. The appellant argues that he was unable to comply within 30 days because the agency acted in bad faith by not arranging a convenient time for Dr. Margolis to visit the work site. In addition, the appellant objects that "the Postal Service never informed Appellant that he was in breach of the 30 day timeframe and the Appellant always acted with the expectation that the Postal Service was awaiting the test results from Dr. Margolis as was Appellant."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that implicit in any settlement agreement, as under other contracts, is a requirement that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "Good faith performance or enforcement of a contract emphasizes faithfulness to an agreed common purpose and consistency with the justified expectations of the other party; it excludes a variety of types of conduct characterized as involving 'bad faith' because they violate community standards of decency, fairness or reasonableness." Restatement (Second) of Contracts, &#x00A7; 205 cmt. a (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency could have been more cooperative in assisting the appellant's physician, we do not believe that its actions fall within the range of conduct characterized as "bad faith."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Allen v. VA</span>, 651 Fed. Appx. 972, 978-79 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), implied that, although a party must abide by a settlement in good faith, to prove a breach a party must prove, not just allege, bad faith by the counterparty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, the interpretation of which is a matter of law reviewed by this court <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 142 F.3d at 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Whether a settlement agreement has been breached is a factual finding, which we review for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev</span>., 124 F.3d 1439, 1441-42 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Every contract contains an implied covenant that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Link v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Thus, a party breaches its obligation of good faith and fair dealing by acting in bad faith with respect to a settlement term. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "Bad faith" is not simply bad judgment or negligence but instead implies conscious wrongdoing because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity. <span class="Italic">See Silva v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 268, 272 (1993) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without any citation to evidence in the record, Mr. Allen argues "[t]he [a]gency's 'bad faith' is embedded in the fact that Agency Office of Resolution Management employees are still angry and humiliated that it had to resolve [his] appeal of his wrongful termination based on fabricated charges of misconduct by allowing him to be reinstated, resign, give him a 'clean record,' and access to employment related benefits that he was entitled to claim and receive, rather than end his employment based on fabricated charges of misconduct." The record on appeal, however, shows that Mr. Allen only made allegations that isolated actions of incorrect and/or delayed processing of benefits claims were purposeful; he did not support those bare allegations with any actual evidence of conscious wrongdoing. Although Mr. Allen argues the administrative judge failed to properly consider all material and relevant facts, he does not identify the specific facts of dishonest purpose that he believes the administrative judge overlooked. Accordingly, Mr. Allen has not carried his burden of demonstrating error in the administrative judge's failure to find bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Good faith as a condition of settlement, even if explicitly stated in an agreement, will not be interpreted to require substantively more than the agreement expressly provides. <span class="Italic">Slattery v. DOJ</span>, 590 F.3d 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2010), determined that a requirement of good faith commitment to consider an appellant for vacancies did not require the agency to withhold from selecting officials unfavorable information about the appellant, when that condition was not expressly stated in a last chance settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant seeks to set an agreement aside, or to pursue a specific enforcement remedy, on the strength of an allegation that the agency has not implemented the agreement in good faith, the appellant will need to provide specific examples of the agency's misconduct, as <span class="Italic">Timberlake v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 520, 524-25 (1998), pointed out:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's general allegation that the agency has harassed him by denying him rights and privileges to which he is entitled must be considered an allegation of the agency's breach of the good faith provision implicit in every agreement. <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 68 MSPR 314, 324-25 (1995). To establish such a breach, the appellant must show that the agency's proven retaliatory or harassing actions, under the totality of the circumstances, amounted to an unjustified and substantial deprivation of his rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By failing to set forth any specific acts the agency allegedly committed in connection with his claim of harassment, the appellant has wholly failed to meet his burden. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 326-29. As such, he has not shown that the administrative judge erred in rejecting this claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations of breach by agency bad faith are considered on the basis of the language of the agreement and the existence or severity of the problems encountered by the appellant. The Federal Circuit analyzed a series of allegations relating to bad faith implementation of an agreement in <span class="Italic">Gard v. Dept. of Education</span>, 180 Fed. Appx. 921, 921-23 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gard and the DOE executed a settlement agreement on May 20, 2002 to resolve his whistleblower reprisal claims that were pending before the Board. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Gard agreed to withdraw his pending appeal, and, with certain exceptions, forbear from filing any lawsuits against the DOE for any circumstances relating to his employment arising on or before the date of the agreement. In return, the DOE agreed not to propose or implement an adverse action against Mr. Gard for any employment related circumstance known to the DOE at the time of the agreement. The DOE also agreed to allow Mr. Gard to stay at his current position, to not reassign Mr. Gard without his approval for six months after recording the settlement agreement, and to award him a one-step pay increase. The DOE complied with all the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December of 2004, Mr. Gard filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement. He alleged that the DOE did not implement the settlement agreement in good faith, and therefore, was not in compliance with the terms of the agreement. Mr. Gard specifically claimed that the DOE violated the agreement by (1) giving him few meaningful work assignments; (2) creating a hostile work environment; (3) denying a request to attend a training class; and (4) refusing to allow him to work on his lawsuits against the DOE at home on official government time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a settlement agreement, like any other contract, there is a requirement that the parties fulfill their respective contractual obligations in good faith. <span class="Italic">Link v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Thus, <span id="Page_5075"></span>a party may breach a settlement agreement by acting in bad faith with respect to a settlement term. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mr. Gard needs to establish that the DOE breached the settlement agreement by showing that its actions constituted bad faith noncompliance with the terms. <span class="Italic">See Kuykendall v. Dep't of Veterans</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 314, 323 (1995). Mr. Gard fails to establish this breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gard agrees that the DOE met each of its obligations expressed in the settlement agreement. Nevertheless, he claims that the DOE merely returned him to his position, and did not honor the underlying, implied contract terms of providing meaningful work assignments and a non-hostile working environment. <span class="Italic">See Id.</span> (construing...a settlement term as obligating the agency merely to technically and facially reinstate the appellant would be unreasonable). Additionally, he claims that after returning to work, the DOE breached the settlement agreement by acting in bad faith in denying a request to attend a training class and refusing to allow him to work on his lawsuits against the DOE at home on official government time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his complaint to the Board, Mr. Gard cites several occasions in which his current supervisor, Mr. Mueller, did not give him meaningful work assignments. "A mere showing of some frictions, misunderstandings, or unpleasantness between the appellant and other employees or managers" is not sufficient to meet the burden to establish that the DOE acted in bad faith with respect to the agreement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 325. Mr. Gard alleges some complaints regarding the quality of his current assignments, but he mostly cites unpleasant interactions with Mr. Mueller. Mr. Gard, however, fails to make a connection between his current assignments, the friction with Mr. Mueller and the terms of the settlement agreement. Without this connection, the AJ was unable to find that the DOE acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Gard also fails to support his claim that the DOE is creating a hostile work environment as a breach of the settlement agreement. Mr. Gard only points to one limited encounter in which he was reprimanded by Mr. Mueller to support his claim. Mr. Gard, however, failed to produce evidence illustrating a pattern of such behavior dating back to the settlement agreement implementation. Thus, Mr. Gard fails to show how this one encounter demonstrates that the DOE provided a hostile work environment and acted in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Mr. Gard's claim that the DOE acted in bad faith because it denied his training request is equally lacking. First, there is no term in the settlement agreement requiring the DOE to provide any training. Second, Mr. Gard has attended several training classes since the settlement agreement was implemented. Third, Mr. Mueller did not deny Mr. Gard's training request, but asked that he take a similar class offered by a different class provider, Management Concepts. Mr. Gard was not able to take the Management Concepts class and asked again to take the class with ESI, a different class provider. Mr. Mueller denied the request. The denial of a single request, which was not a term of the settlement agreement, is not a reflection of the DOE's bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Gard's claim, that the DOE's refusal to allow him to work on his lawsuits against the DOE at home on official government time does not support his claim of bad faith. Mr. Gard provided no evidence to the Board that indicated he and his employer had such an arrangement. Moreover, this requested accommodation does not appear in the settlement agreement, and the DOE is not required to allow such absences from work. Thus, the DOE's denial of his request was not in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bernard v. USDA</span>, DE-0752-11-0222-C-1 (NP 1/22/2014) (vacated and remanded, <span class="Italic">Bernard v. USDA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3083.Opinion.6-9-2015.1.PDF">788 F.3d 1365</a> (Fed. Cir. 2015)) (difficulties experienced by the appellant following a settlement that called for his reassignment: "Absent evidence that the appellant was treated differently from other employees, the fact that the appellant's new managers were apparently more stringent in complying with the regulations does not prove an improper intent to violate the terms of the settlement agreement.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As settlement is a bilateral process, obstructions to settlements may also be created by the appellant. If the appellant breaches his agreement and then complains of noncompliance, the breach, if directly related to the compliance problem, can justify the agency's failure to honor the pertinent part of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Dept. of Army</span>, 107 Fed. Appx. 899, 901 (Fed.

USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 526, 529-30 (1986) (reassignment was justified by the appellant's disruptive conduct and breach of a provision of a settlement agreement that implicitly required the appellant to undergo a course of therapy). If the agency cannot fulfill its obligations without information or cooperation from the appellant, the agency will not be faulted when the appellant's objectives are not met through the settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conerly v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 182, 185 (1994) (settlement obliged agency to assist appellant in applying for disability retirement, but appellant did not submit medical documentation); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v.

DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 59 (2005), for the concluding Board opinion). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-201.html#sec16-196">Mutual Breach; 'Clean Hands.'</a>"]</p>
