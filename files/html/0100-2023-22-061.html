<p class="Body-Text">The basic determinants for application of the "knew or should have known" standard to fee petitions in retirement cases were explained in <span class="Italic">Biscaha v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 500, 504 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A determination that an award is warranted under this category requires an evaluation of the record before OPM at the time the reconsideration decision was made. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farrero v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 35 MSPR 630, 633 (1987). If it is found that OPM was negligent in processing the application, or that it lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, then it can be concluded that it knew or should have known that it could not prevail. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Emond v. OPM</span>, DC-831M-12-0383-A-1 (NP 8/4/2022) (overpayment: "the Board considers whether OPM was negligent in processing the application, lacked a reasonable or supportable explanation for its position, or ignored clear, unrebutted evidence that the appellant satisfied the criteria for a benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 544, 548 (1996)."); <span class="Italic">Gammill v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 279, 282 (1987) ("If OPM is found to be negligent in its processing of an application, or to have lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its denial of the application, then it can be concluded that OPM 'knew or should have known' that it could not prevail on the merits of its decision to deny disability benefits[.] "); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Francois v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 191, 194 (1994) (same as <span class="Italic">Gammill</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An earlier decision providing some guidance concerning application of the "knew or should have known" standard in retirement appeals is <span class="Italic">Simmons v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 559, 561-62 (1986), on a return trip to the Board after the Federal Circuit reversed the Board's earlier decision that fees were unavailable in retirement cases. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. MSPB</span>, 768 F.2d 323 (Fed. Cir. 1985). On remand the Board noted OPM's treatment of the application for retirement benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon receipt of appellant's application, OPM did not solicit any medical evidence of its own or have appellant examined by a staff physician. It concluded, on the basis of the record submitted by appellant, that total disability was not shown. Appellant thereupon petitioned OPM for reconsideration of its decision. In support of her petition, appellant submitted additional uncontroverted medical evidence....&#8197;OPM, again without producing any countervailing medical evidence, denied appellant's request for reconsideration.... OPM relied upon a statement made by appellant's supervisor to support its denial upon reconsideration of appellant's application. In that statement, which was based on observations of the appellant's ability prior to her second surgery, the supervisor said that the appellant "was able to perform all WG-01 duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant appealed OPM's reconsideration decision denying her disability retirement to the Board's Washington, D.C., Regional Office. She produced further medical evidence....&#8197;[A]n initial decision...sustained OPM's denial....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant filed a petition for judicial review....&#8197;[W]hile the court proceeding was pending, GSA separated appellant from the federal service because of her physical inability to perform the full duties of her position....&#8197;The court found that appellant's removal was "at odds with, if not patently inconsistent with the denial of petitioner's disability retirement application simply on the ground that she has continued to perform her duties." <span class="Italic">Simmons v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 684 F.2d 1033 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The court directed that the case be remanded to the Board for further evidentiary development.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the remand the appellant was awarded disability retirement benefits by the Board. She then filed for counsel fees. This request was denied by the AJ, who decided that there was no bad faith by OPM and that OPM did not know nor should it have known that it would not prevail. On PFR the Board reversed, 31 MSPR at 565-66:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories to appellant's case, the Board finds that the agency "knew or should have known that it could not prevail on the merits" of an appeal when it issued the reconsideration decision in her case....&#8197;The Board finds that in light of the uncontroverted medical evidence in the record establishing appellant's disability, the supervisor's statement was not entitled to the dispositive weight given it by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we recognize that it is the appellant, rather than the agency, who initiates the proceedings and who submits most of the record evidence in an employee-initiated application for disability retirement, it remains true that OPM's assessment of the evidence, which determines the employee's receipt or non-receipt of the benefit sought, may be a decision which OPM knew or should have known would not be sustained on appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Given the uncontroverted medical evidence provided to it by appellant, we find that OPM should have known that it could not prevail on an appeal from the denial of the appellant's disability retirement application based solely on a single, unsubstantiated, uncorroborated, and unexplained supervisor's statement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board added to the <span class="Italic">Simmons</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Kent v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 361, 366-67 (1987) (discussed earlier concerning the "clearly without merit" entitlement standard):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Simmons</span>, the Board recognized that, while it is the appellant who initiates the proceedings and who generally submits most of the record evidence in an employee-initiated application for disability retirement, <span id="Page_4591"></span>OPM's reconsideration decision may be a decision that OPM knew or should have known would not be sustained on appeal to the Board. In those cases, a fee award would be warranted under category five. A determination that an award is warranted under this category requires an evaluation of the record before OPM at the time the reconsideration decision was made. Consequently, we are concerned with the nature and the weight of evidence provided by an appellant to OPM to establish his entitlement to a retirement annuity, as well as OPM's evaluation of that evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...If it is found that the agency was negligent in the processing of the application, or that it lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, then it can be concluded that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If new evidence is introduced before the Board in a retirement case that differs from, but does not materially add to, the information available to OPM at the time of its reconsideration decision, OPM may be charged with actual or constructive knowledge that it could not prevail on the merits. Fees will then be awarded if the medical evidence is reasonably clear. <span class="Italic">Feller v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 437, 441 (1989) (physician and the appellant testified but their evidence basically repeated the information already before OPM); <span class="Italic">Reves v.

[t]he evidence submitted on appeal did not add materially to the statements in the record before OPM at the time of its reconsideration decision[.] "). Refer to <span class="Italic">Obremski v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 554, 557 (1986), discussed earlier concerning the application of the "clearly without merit" standard to retirement cases, for comparable results when OPM applies the wrong legal standard to record evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If evidence dispositive of a retirement appeal--whether the appellant's time for establishing a survivor annuity was equitably tolled through misleading advice from OPM--is resolved in the appellant's favor through credibility analysis at the MSPB hearing, fees are not awarded on the basis that OPM knew or should have known it would not prevail in the appeal, <span class="Italic">Willis v. OPM,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210429149">853 Fed. Appx. 662</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, "[f]ees are warranted in the interest of justice when OPM knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits at the time it issued its reconsideration decision." <span class="Italic">Kent v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 33 M.S.P.R. 361, 366 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 15, 1987). Here, Mr. Willis might be entitled to fees if he "produced evidence that was so compelling that reasonable minds could not differ as to his eligibility for an annuity and OPM's continued refusal to approve a disability retirement annuity for the appellant prolonged the adjudication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 369.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Willis argues that the MSPB's finding that OPM did not have evidence supporting equitable tolling prior to its denial of reconsideration in April 2019 is erroneous. In support, Mr. Willis points to language from the October 4, 2018 supplement to his request for reconsideration and his December 2017 and January 2018 submissions to OPM. He argues that these correspondences prove he made multiple attempts to inform OPM that it misled him prior to its April 2019 reconsideration denial. We disagree. The question is not whether he informed OPM that it had misled him, but whether he provided conclusive evidence before the denial of reconsideration that he had been misled such that equitable tolling must apply. But the evidence shows that Mr. Willis did not inform OPM until his August 2019 affidavit. The AJ found that "the appellant's entire argument for equitable tolling rested upon the credibility of [the statement in his affidavit]--an issue which both parties agreed would be resolved through the hearing process."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Willis further contends that it became clear during the hearing that he was entitled to the benefits and OPM needlessly prolonged the proceedings since his August 2019 affidavit and pre-hearing submissions clarified that the misleading call occurred in March 2009 and that he and his wife would testify to that timing. According to Mr. Willis, the information should have made clear by August 2019 that OPM would not prevail at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded. As the MSPB noted, Mr. Willis's equitable tolling argument rested on the credibility of his and Mrs. Willis's hearing testimony. The AJ himself "did not know ahead of time whether this testimony would be credible." The MSPB ultimately concluded that OPM, relying on the same record on which the AJ relied, "neither knew, nor could have known, how these questions of credibility would be resolved until the hearing ended." Further, OPM "could not be expected to surmise from the record as it stood before the hearing that its position was clearly without merit, since that determination required weighing the credibility of testimony [OPM] had not yet heard." As such, OPM was justified in thinking it had a meritorious position prior to the October 2019 hearing. The MSPB's decision is therefore supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were denied under the "knew or should have known" standard to a retirement appellant whose adverse OPM determination resulted from his failure to provide detailed information concerning his current medical condition and employment. OPM reversed its own decision once the appeal was underway and the appellant supplied more specific information to bolster his annuity appeal. <span class="Italic">Smith v.

OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 131, 133-34 (1988) (fees denied: the reconsideration decision was not faulty; under the alternative standard, the appellant presented persuasive but not compelling evidence for the first time at the hearing showing why he should have been permitted to redeposit retirement contributions); <span class="Italic">Myrick v.

OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 479, 484-85 (1988) (fees denied under both standards: OPM's result was correct at the reconsideration level; testimony produced at the hearing revealed why the appellant's condition prevented him from performing his old job but not the job he later assumed; no fees were incurred after the hearing, so no determination was necessary as to the "compelling evidence" standard); <span class="Italic">Beech v.

<p class="Body-Text">An example of a fee award in a successful challenge to OPM's denial of waiver of retirement overpayments is <span class="Italic">Parker v. OPM</span>, 75 MSPR 688, 692 (1997), granting a fee application when it was clear that OPM failed to apply properly its own policy guidelines governing overpayment waivers to the information before it (or the information that it should have obtained) at the time it issued its reconsideration decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the "knew or should have known" standard, the Board must evaluate the record that OPM had before it when it issued its reconsideration decision. If the Board finds that OPM was negligent in processing the waiver application, that it lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, or that it ignored clear, unrebutted evidence that the appellant satisfied the criteria for the benefit, the Board can conclude that OPM knew or should have known, that it could not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fleming v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 MSPR 37, 40 (1994). In this respect, the Board is concerned both with the nature and weight of the evidence that the appellant provided to OPM to support her application, and with OPM's evaluation of that evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Madera v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 MSPR 310, 312 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Pacheco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 MSPR 129, 132 (1995), citing <span class="Italic">Belcher v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 362, 366 (1988) (reasoning in disability retirement appeals equally applicable in all retirement-related appeals).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duke v. OPM</span>, 78 MSPR 578, 581-84, 586-87 (1998), reaffirmed that an award of fees is appropriate if hearing testimony is cumulative, not dispositive, and if OPM's records supported disability retirement or if OPM could have satisfied itself as to retirement eligibility with minimal inquiry:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination that an award is warranted under the "knew or should have known" category requires an evaluation of the record before OPM at the time its final decision was made. <span class="Italic">See Kent</span>, 33 MSPR at 367. In determining whether an award is merited under this category, the Board considers whether OPM was negligent in processing a retirement application, lacked a reasonable and supportable explanation for its position, or ignored clear, unrebutted evidence that the appellant satisfied the criteria for a retirement benefit. <span class="Italic">Fleming v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 MSPR 37, 40 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying the appellant's application for attorney fees under the "knew or should have known" category, the administrative judge stated that the critical factor in her decision to reverse OPM's final decision was evidence not available to OPM at the time it made its final decision. According to the administrative judge, this evidence consisted of additional evidence of the appellant's treatment for depression and anxiety throughout her physical illness, her testimony as to the severity of her mental condition and its effect on her ability to perform the duties of her position, her observation of the appellant's demeanor and the severity of the appellant's condition during her testimony, and the record of the appellant's medications. This evidence and testimony, the AJ found, showed for the first time that the appellant's psychological condition prevented her from performing <span id="Page_4593"></span>the essential duties of her position. While we agree with the AJ that this evidence, when considered with the remainder of the record before OPM, clearly establishes the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement, we also agree with the appellant that, except for the administrative judge's observation of the appellant's demeanor and condition during the hearing, all of this evidence either was part of the record before OPM or was readily available to OPM through minimal inquiry at the time OPM issued its final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her application for disability retirement benefits, the appellant stated that she takes "various medications," and that she was "not sure there is any position available where [she] [can] work alone away from people under medication." At the time OPM made its final decision denying the appellant's application for benefits, it had before it these statements in the appellant's application, an April 18, 1996 letter from Dr. Blake, a psychiatrist, who evaluated the appellant for purposes of her application for social security disability benefits, a July 1, 1996 letter from Dr. Marple, the appellant's primary care provider from March 1994, through April 1996, Dr. Marple's medical records for that period of time, and a July 1996 letter from Dr. Chelf, a psychiatrist who treated the appellant from September 29, 1995, through February 19, 1996. In these respective documents, Drs. Marple and Chelf set forth the numerous heavy medications they had prescribed for the appellant; these medications were confirmed by Dr. Blake's April 1996 letter, in which he reported the appellant's account of her current and past medications. Consequently, the same information about the appellant's medications that was provided by the record of the appellant's medications submitted for the first time during the appellate process is found in these medical records, albeit not in the same convenient list format. All OPM had to do to evaluate the appellant's claim concerning the disabling effects of the medication she was taking for her psychological condition was to read and evaluate the medical records as a whole. This OPM apparently did not do as there is no mention of the appellant's medications or the effect of these medications on her ability to perform the essential duties of her position in OPM's final decision. Thus, contrary to the administrative judge, the record of the appellant's medications was evidence available to OPM at the time it made its final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, if OPM believed that the appellant's statements in her disability retirement application or the medical records submitted were ambiguous or insufficient as to the appellant's medications and the extent she was disabled by these medications, it had a duty to apprise the appellant of this so that she could address it with additional evidence. <span class="Italic">See Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 MSPR 619, 626 (1996) (OPM's failure to advise the employee, prior to its final decision, that her evidence as to the expected duration of her disability was insufficient was a factor in the Board's determination that OPM knew or should have known that its decision would not be upheld on appeal). Here, there is no evidence that OPM ever contacted the appellant after it received her application for disability retirement benefits to inform her that her evidence was insufficient or to otherwise obtain additional information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the administrative judge considered and relied upon the appellant's testimony during the hearing in finding that the appellant suffers from a disabling psychological condition, does not alter the fact that OPM, based on the evidence before it, also should have concluded that the appellant suffers from a disabling psychological condition. The administrative judge stated that the appellant's testimony was the critical factor in reversing OPM's decision because it described, for the first time, the degree to which the appellant's illness affected all aspects of her daily life, the demanding and complex nature of her job duties, and the interrelation of her present condition and the long-term physical illness which had been resolved. Like the record of the appellant's medications, however, the appellant's testimony on these matters was available to OPM at the time it made its decision. <span class="Italic">See Mansfield v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 MSPR 602, 607 (1997) (the employee's testimony was available to OPM at the time it issued its final decision). If OPM had additional questions concerning the degree to which the appellant's condition affected all aspects of her daily life, the nature of her job duties, and the interrelation of her present condition and the long-term physical illness, it was required to apprise the appellant of this so that she could address it with additional evidence. <span class="Italic">See Mullins-Howard,</span> 71 MSPR at 626. Having failed to do this, OPM cannot now claim that the evidence before it at the time of its final decision was insufficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these medical records, as well as the position description, the April 24, 1996 SSA decision, the appellant's own account of the effect of her psychological condition and the medication to control this condition on her ability to function, and the evidence of the appellant's deteriorating attendance, performance, and conduct at work in the past two years, all of which were available to OPM at the time it made its final decision, we find that Dr. Chelf's March 19, 1997 letter was merely cumulative, not dispositive, evidence of the appellant's disability<span class="Italic">. See Francis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 43, 46 (1987) (attorney fees warranted under the "knew or should have known" standard despite the submission of new medical evidence during the hearing because the medical evidence submitted to OPM was uncontroverted); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 371, 375 (1987) (same where the medical evidence submitted to OPM was overwhelming). For the same reason, we find that the demeanor evidence and the administrative judge's personal observation of the appellant's condition during the hearing were cumulative, not dispositive, evidence. That is, even without Dr. Chelf's letter and the opportunity to observe the appellant's demeanor and psychological condition at the hearing, OPM knew or should have known, based on all of the evidence that either was part of the record before OPM or was readily available to OPM through minimal inquiry, that the appellant's condition precluded her from performing the essential duties of her position<span class="Italic">. See Francis</span>, 36 MSPR at 46; <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 33 MSPR at 375-76.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees will not be awarded if OPM legitimately seeks clarification of ambiguous or incomplete information submitted from the appellant and then allows the case to proceed to the point of an initial decision, <span class="Italic">Stewart v. OPM</span>, 70 MSPR 544, 548-49, 550-51 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the knew or should have known standard, the Board must evaluate the record that OPM had before it when it issued its reconsideration decision.

<p class="Body-Text">If information supplied by the appellant ought to put OPM on notice that a disability claim would qualify for approval if further explained, fees will be awarded under the "knew or should have known" criterion if the retirement appeal is granted by the Board on the basis of information that OPM should have clarified on its own initiative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v.
