<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-183"><span class="space">9.</span> Search</h4>
<p class="noindent">Proposals that limited searches of employees' property to only those situations involving reasonable cause to believe that the employee attempted to steal something, and proposals that called on management to agree not to conduct unannounced searches of employees, interfered with management's right to determine internal security practices. <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU and Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB</span>, 16 FLRA 361, 361-62 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1214 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Training Ctr.</span>, 49 FLRA 725, 729 (1994) (denying negotiability of proposals that precluded agency from conducting unannounced inspections of unit employees and their vehicles at gates of agency installation absent probable cause). A proposal interfered with management's right to determine its internal security practices because it prohibited body or clothing searches unless authorized by warrant or incidental to an arrest. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 21 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 18 FLRA 405, 405-06 (1985). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that precluded searches of cars, trucks, or other personal property of employees unless "this action can be proven to the Union President, before the action takes place." The proposal interfered with the agency's internal security practices by conditioning the management right to determine those practices on the approval of the union. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Dept. of Military Affairs, Illinois Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 35 FLRA 740, 750-51 (1990). <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-22 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Air Defense Artillery Ctr.</span>, 45 FLRA 949, 953-70 (1992), considered nonnegotiable, because of impairment of internal security, and inappropriate as arrangements, proposals regulating the conditions of gate inspections, requiring advance notice of gate inspections, requiring that the union to be given written instructions and schedules relating to inspections, mandating an opportunity be given to the union to have a representative on official time at gate inspections, and allowing the union to provide a notice of rights to employees subject to inspections. FLRA allowed as negotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-22</span> a proposal that employees not suffer loss of pay or leave or be disciplined for not reporting to work on time as a result of the delay involved in gate inspections; nonnegotiable as inconsistent with government-wide regulations was a proposal that required payment of overtime if an employee's tour of duty is delayed due to a gate inspection.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that modified the location of searches conducted by the agency of employees' personal effects was outside the duty to bargain. It involved the agency internal security practices. <span class="Italic">FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard</span>, 12 FLRA 361, 361-62 (1983). Proposals were nonnegotiable, as intrusions into agency security practices, that precluded searches or inspections of persons and property on or leaving agency premises. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-6 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Eustis</span>, 29 FLRA 966, 967-68 (1987). For the same reason a proposal precluding drug-detection dogs was nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">OPEIU, Local 268 and Dept. of Energy</span>, 31 FLRA 9, 11 (1988). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-512.html#sec6-513">Office and Desk Use; Privacy</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-14-513.html#sec6-514">Search of Offices, Furniture</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 28 and Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 47 FLRA 873, 877-80 (1993), was Proposal 1, mandating that "[p]urses and/or Pocket books [sic] will not be inspected unless there is reason to believe an unauthorized possession or theft has taken place (<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, observed in action or an unusually large bulge)." FLRA declined to impose on the agency constitutional protections governing searches:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, and operations against internal and external risks.... An agency's right to determine its internal security practices also includes the right to determine the investigative techniques the agency will use to achieve its internal security objectives.... Where the agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the practice or investigative technique designed to implement that goal, a proposal that directly interferes with the agency's practice or investigative technique conflicts with the agency's right under section 7106(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that in order to deter pilferage, or theft, of commissary store items, it must retain the ability to conduct unannounced random inspections of personal hand-carried items as the employees exit the commissary. According to the Agency, these inspections are necessary to ensure control of store merchandise until it is purchased and properly removed from commissary store premises. We find that the Agency has established that its policy of conducting unannounced random inspections of employees' hand-carried items is <span id="page_750"></span>linked to the stated purpose of avoiding theft at the commissary store. Consequently, the policy of unannounced random inspections of hand-carried items constitutes an internal security practice under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. For the following reasons, we find that Proposal 1 directly interferes with the exercise of that management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that Proposal 1 is designed to protect the constitutional guarantee of freedom from an unreasonable search and is intended to limit inspections of employee purses and pocketbooks to circumstances where the Agency has "reason to believe" or "reasonable suspicion[ ]" that theft has occurred. The Union maintains, in this connection, that Proposal 1 incorporates into the parties' collective bargaining agreement the reasonableness standard for searches of Government employees established by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Ortega</span> [<span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. 709 (1987)]. In that case, the Supreme Court held that where a search of a Government employee is conducted pursuant to an investigation of work-related misconduct, a public employer may intrude on the constitutionally protected privacy interest of Government employees under the Fourth Amendment based on a standard of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 725-26. Based on the language of the proposal and the Union's stated intent, which is consistent with that language, it is clear that the proposal seeks to require compliance with a constitutional standard of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Fort McPherson</span>, in which a similar proposal was found negotiable based, in part, on its consistency with <span class="Italic">Ortega</span>, we issued a decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Department of Education Council of AFGE Locals and U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1071 (1990), (<span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>)...In <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, we found that a proposal requiring an agency to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute in accordance with "external legal limitations (that is, the United States Constitution, applicable laws, rules and regulations)," directly interfered with management's rights under that section. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1076. In this case, the proposal would essentially require the Agency to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) by conducting searches of purses and pocketbooks in accordance with a constitutional standard of reasonableness. As such, Proposal 1 would impermissibly subject the exercise of management's rights to an external legal limitation. Accordingly, we conclude, for the reasons more fully set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, that Proposal 1 directly interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find, contrary to the Union's assertion, that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement.... Applying <span class="Italic">KANG</span> [21 FLRA 24 (1986)], we find that, even assuming Proposal 1 is intended as an arrangement for employees who may be adversely affected by management's decision to conduct unannounced random searches of personal hand-carried items, the proposal would excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we find that the proposal would afford certain benefits to employees. In particular, the proposal would reduce the potential for the invasion of an employee's privacy by an unannounced random inspection of purses and pocketbooks. In addition, the proposal would reduce the likelihood that employees would be disciplined as a result of being discovered with stolen commissary property following an inspection. We note, in this regard, that the Agency's directive permits the imposition of disciplinary action if an employee is discovered with stolen commissary property in his or her possession. On the other hand, the proposal would significantly affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Foremost is the fact that the Agency would be unable to conduct random inspections. As stated earlier, the Agency's policy of unannounced random inspections of personal hand-carried items is necessary to prevent theft and to ensure control of store merchandise until it is purchased. As further explained by the Agency, many of the items sold at commissaries are easily concealed in hand-carried items, such as purses. By preventing the inspection of purses and pocketbooks unless there is reason to believe that an unauthorized possession or theft has occurred, the proposal would eliminate the random selection of employees for inspections. As such, the proposal would seriously impair the Agency's ability to detect the pilfering of small and easily concealable store merchandise and, thereby, to safeguard its property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, on balance, we conclude that the proposal's imposition of severe limitations on the Agency's authority to conduct unannounced random searches of personal hand-carried items outweighs the benefits afforded employees by the proposal. Accordingly, Proposal 1 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Also nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 28 and Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 47 FLRA 873, 880, 882 (1993), was Proposal 2, that "[t]he Union shall be given the opportunity to witness compliance of each spot check conducted on bargaining unit employees." The proposal interfered with the right of the agency to determine its internal security practices, and the benefit to employees was outweighed by the increased likelihood that information regarding the inspections would be inadvertently disclosed to employees, negating the deterrent effect of the inspections.</p>
<p class="noindent">A decision addressing the negotiability of search-related proposals involving employees working at a prison, <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 919 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth</span>, 42 FLRA 1295, 1296 (1991), injected a "special circumstances" consideration into the negotiability formula. Under review was Provision 1:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 6.&#x2003;Section E. Recognizing the Employer's legal rights to search the personal property of any employee when such property is on the grounds of the Federal Reservation, such search shall be conducted in accordance with current laws and regulations. <span class="Italic">Such search will be witnessed by the employee owner of searched property and/or that employee's representative of his/her choice</span>. [Only the emphasized portion of this provision was in dispute].</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was nonnegotiable, 42 FLRA at 1298-301:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the right to determine internal security practices includes an agency's right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its operations, personnel and physical property against internal or external risks.... An agency's right to determine its internal security practices also includes the right to determine the investigative techniques the agency will use to achieve its internal security objectives.... Where an agency shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the practice or investigative technique designed to implement that goal, a proposal that directly interferes with the agency's practice or investigative technique conflicts with the agency's right under section 7106(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency asserts that it must, in some circumstances, engage in an unannounced search of employee property that is on its premises. The Agency contends that in some circumstances the Agency must ascertain whether the employee's property contains contraband without the employee's knowledge so that further investigation of the matter will not be compromised.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously held that proposals requiring that an employee's desk, file cabinets, or lockers not be searched unless the employee is present do not directly interfere with management's right to determine its internal security procedures, but, rather, constitute procedures that are negotiable under section 7106(b)(2)<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1759 and Department of Defense, Department of the Army, Headquarters, Fort McPherson, Georgia</span>, 29 FLRA 261 (1987) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and NTEU Chapter 61 and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Albany District, New York</span>, 7 FLRA 304 (1981) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Albany District</span>). However, it should be noted that in finding that the proposal at issue in <span class="Italic">IRS, Albany District</span> was negotiable, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Agency...adduces no other relevant information that would support a finding that the proposal necessarily would preclude achieving the objectives of the internal security practice in question. Hence, in the absence of a showing that the Union's proposal could not be implemented consistent with law and regulation in a manner which would allow the Agency to achieve its legitimate internal security objectives, it is concluded that the proposal is within the duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">7 FLRA at 307.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, information presented by the Agency supports a conclusion that requiring the Agency to notify an employee, in every instance, of the Agency's intention to search the employee's property for contraband would interfere with the Agency's ability to achieve its legitimate internal security objective of investigating the supply of contraband to inmates. Thus, the circumstances presented in this case warrant an exception to the conclusion generally reached in previous cases that proposals requiring that employees be present when their lockers, desks, and other property are searched are procedural and do not directly interfere with an agency's management right to determine its internal security practices. We conclude that in the circumstances presented in this case, the disputed portion of this provision directly interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This conclusion is consistent with the Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, Connecticut</span>, 29 FLRA 990, 1014 (1987)...that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A Federal correctional facility is different from general office space. The Agency has special security concerns not routinely present <span id="page_751"></span>in other work locations. At a correctional facility, internal security practices are of paramount importance, and the need to ensure that no unauthorized weapons or contraband are present is critical.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">IRS, Jacksonville District</span>, 23 FLRA 876 (1986). In that decision, the Authority stated that requiring union representation when the agency was monitoring employee telephone conversations with taxpayers would not comport with the surreptitious nature of the agency's surveillance activities and would unduly interfere with management's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute to determine internal security practices. The Authority noted "[i]t would produce the anomalous prohibition that agencies could not engage in unannounced surveillance of allegedly dishonest employees as an investigative technique without first informing the employee of what was being done and providing an opportunity to request representation."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the decision in <span class="Italic">FCI, Danbury</span> suggests that a proposal permitting employees to be present when their personal property is searched is in all instances a "procedure which does not interfere with management's ability to protect its personnel and property," it will no longer be followed. 29 FLRA at 1015. Rather, in determining whether such notice is procedural, we will take into account any special circumstances that are revealed to us in the record concerning the relationship between notifying employees of searches and an agency's ability to achieve its legitimate internal security objectives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that where such an issue exists, the burden is on the parties to create a record upon which the Authority can make a negotiability determination.... A party failing to meet this burden acts at its peril....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The nature of this provision and the thrust of the Union's statements concerning the intent of the provision suggest that it is intended as an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to determine internal security practices. However, the record does not permit a determination of whether this provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">But in the context of operation of a penitentiary, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 171 and DOJ, FCI El Reno,</span> 64 FLRA 275, 276-78 (2009), resolved as negotiable a proposal permitting the presence of a union representative during searches conducted of employees' property under defined circumstances:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Where a reasonable expectation of privacy exist[s] and there is reasonable suspicion, searches of employee[s'] personal property within their assigned/work stations by management or a representative of the employer will have a union representative present, absent an overriding exigency. The Union representative will be designated by the Union President or his designee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Establish an Expectation of Privacy That Does Not Already Exist at the Agency's Facilities.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the proposal assumes that employees have an expectation of privacy that does not exist under the Agency's current rules. However, the Agency's own rules regarding searches at its facilities refute its contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, 28 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.10 makes it clear that the rules regarding searches of non-inmates apply to all persons, and the Agency acknowledges that the rules apply to non-visitors as well as non-inmates. Thus, the rules apply to employees. Further, &#x00A7; 511.15(a)(2) and &#x00A7; 511.17 indicate that non-inmates have the right to refuse a search by leaving Agency grounds instead of submitting to a search. Therefore, a non-inmate does not automatically surrender his or her expectation of privacy when entering the prison, and even if a non-inmate is selected for a random search, he or she can preserve his or her privacy rights by electing to vacate the premises. Of course. if an employee makes such an election, then other personnel issues--including those related to absence without--leave may arise. Nevertheless, the Agency's rule provides employees with a reasonable expectation of privacy, even if that expectation must be balanced against the consequences of acting on it. Although &#x00A7; 511.15(a) addresses random searches, the ability to refuse a reasonable-suspicion search by electing non-entry or departure from the Agency facility is set forth in &#x00A7; 511.17 of the rules. Put simply, under the Agency's own published rules, all non-inmates, including employees, have a reasonable expectation of privacy by virtue of their ability to leave the facility rather than submit to a search.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the proposal applies only to reasonable-suspicion searches. In other words, under the proposal, the presence of a Union representative is not required at every search of an employee's personal property; only reasonable-suspicion searches are covered. Section 511.15(b) of the Agency's rules addresses reasonable-suspicion searches and provides that reasonable suspicion exists if a staff member knows of facts and circumstances that warrant rational inferences that a non-inmate may be engaged in, attempting, or about to engage in, criminal or other prohibited activity. That is, such searches necessitate facts and circumstances warranting rational inferences of illegal activity by someone in the bargaining unit. There is no basis for finding that the proposal is inconsistent with these rules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, the proposal does not establish an expectation of privacy that the Agency does not already recognize, and the Agency's privacy-related arguments do not provide a basis for finding the proposal outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Is Not Contrary to Management's Right to Determine Internal Security</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Federal Prison Council 33,</span> 51 FLRA 1112, 1115 (1996). When management shows a link or reasonable connection between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and the investigative technique designed to implement that objective, a proposal that conflicts with the technique affects management's right. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Locals R14-22 and R14-89, </span>45 FLRA 949, 960 (1992);<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 2143, </span>48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993). In deciding whether a proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices, the Authority does not examine the merit of the practices adopted by an agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that Federal correctional facilities are different from other types of facilities and that, at a correctional facility, internal security practices are of paramount importance and there is a critical need to prevent the introduction of unauthorized weapons and contraband into the facility. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals, Local 919, </span>42 FLRA 1295, 1300 (1991)<span class="Italic"> (AFGE, Local 919). </span>Accordingly, the Authority has held that proposals that address how an agency is to conduct reasonable-suspicion searches of employees' personal property within the workplace affect management's right to determine internal security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 919, </span>42 FLRA at 1300; <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661, </span>29 FLRA 990, 1015 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, even if a proposal affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the proposal is within the duty to bargain if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1156, </span>63 FLRA 340, 341 (2009). To determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, the Authority applies the test set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986) <span class="Italic">(KANG). </span>Under this test, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 31. In this regard, the Authority considers whether the proposal is "tailored" to compensate or benefit employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1687, </span>52 FLRA 521, 523 (1996). If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See KANG, </span>21 FLRA at 31. In making this determination, the Authority balances the proposal's benefits to employees against its burdens on management.<span class="Italic"> See NTEU, </span>62 FLRA 267, 272 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal would permit employees to have Union representation, under certain circumstances, when they are searched by management pursuant to management's exercise of its right to determine internal security practices. As such, it is tailored to benefit only employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of that management right, and we find that it is an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the arrangement is "appropriate," or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights, the Union cites <span class="Italic">El Reno, </span>59 FLRA 536. In <span class="Italic">El Reno,</span> the Authority found that an award enforcing a provision similar to the proposal here did not excessively interfere with management's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 538. Specifically, the Authority found that by ensuring both the "integrity" of searches and the "authenticity of any findings," the provision at issue afforded "significant" benefits to employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, noting that the provision permitted searches without representation in an "overriding exigency" and that there was no indication how this wording would be applied in future cases, the Authority rejected the agency's contention that, on its face, the provision was not enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 539.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the provision in <span class="Italic">El Reno,</span> the proposal here permits reasonable-suspicion searches without Union representation when there is an overriding exigency. Also like the provision in<span class="Italic"> El Reno,</span> the proposal would afford employees significant benefits. Although the Agency claims that the proposal is nonnegotiable on its face, the effect and benefits of this proposal are indistinguishable from the effects and benefits of the provision at issue in <span class="Italic">El Reno.</span> Thus, <span class="Italic">El Reno</span> supports a conclusion that the proposal is within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See KANG, </span>21 FLRA 24 (1986); <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>62 FLRA 267 (2007), <span class="Italic">rem'd on other grounds,</span> 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_752"></span>We reject the Agency's argument that application of this proposal would obligate it "to wait, no matter how many hours or days it may take, for a Union representative to arrive prior to a search, unless there is an overriding exigency." As the Union states, there are approximately twenty union representatives employed at the facility, some of whom are present on every shift. Further, other than the Agency's unsupported assertion of undue delay, the Agency does not explain why a Union representative's attendance at searches where overriding exigencies do not exist would excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's right to determine internal security practices and, thus, constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Accordingly, it is within the duty to bargain.</p>
