<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-92"><span class="space">a.</span> Reassignments Across Organizational Lines</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An early Board decision announced that federal policy called for the utilization, through reassignment, of disabled employees who cannot continue in their positions because of illness or injury. If no position existed within the employee's qualifications, the (now defunct) FPM called for referral of the employee's situation to the agency personnel office for consideration of retraining if basic requirements for other positions were met. Efforts at reassignment of a disabled employee were to extend to coordination with the personnel offices of other federal establishments in the same geographical area, if the employee qualified for no positions in the employing area of the agency. The Board, however, lacked appellate jurisdiction based on a claim of failure to provide proper reassignment consideration in lieu of disability retirement. The employee could pursue the matter through a grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 4, 7, 6 MSPB 619 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without mentioning the seemingly contrary authority that follows, <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Dept. of Energy,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SANCHEZ_SIGIEFREDO_DE_0752_10_0137_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_667166.pdf">117 MSPR 155</a>, 161-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19, 2011 MSPB 95 (2011), determined as to an indefinite suspension of an employee who was allegedly unable to hold a certification required for his position, that the accommodative option of reassignment was not limited to the branch or office that employed the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues in his petition for review that the administrative judge incorrectly found that he was not entitled to reasonable accommodation because she based her decision entirely on whether he could perform the essential duties of the position from which he was removed. Although the administrative judge correctly noted that reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position, her discussion of whether the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability omitted any discussion of the appellant's qualifications for any positions other than the one from which the agency removed him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was entitled to be considered for reassignment to a vacant position for which he was otherwise qualified as a form of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(9); <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center,</span> 156 F.3d 1284, 1301-05 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 (2010); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(ii). Enforcement guidance issued by the EEOC instructs in pertinent part that reassignment to a vacant position is a form of reasonable accommodation that "must be provided to an employee who, because of a disability, can no longer perform the essential functions of his/her current position, with or without reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can show that it would be an undue hardship." <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Reassignment</span>, available at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>]. An appropriate position would be one for which the appellant was qualified by skill, experience, and education and which was equivalent in terms of pay, status, and other relevant factors. 29 C.F.R. part 1630 Appendix, &#x00A7; 1630.2(o); <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance, Reassignment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the record reflects that the agency may have had appropriate positions to which it could have reassigned the appellant as a reasonable accommodation, but the agency failed to engage in the interactive process to find the appellant such an accommodation. Once an appellant has requested accommodation, the employer must engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 15. The appellant requested reassignment to a non-HRP position as a reasonable accommodation, and despite the fact that positions were allegedly available for his reassignment, neither his supervisor nor the Human Resources employee assigned to the appellant's case made any attempt to find him one. Those individuals' testimony that they did not believe they had the authority to reassign the appellant, and that they did not refer the matter to someone who had such authority, supports the appellant's allegation. Thus, the record reflects that the agency failed to engage in the interactive process in order to identify a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 16.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We are cognizant that, while geographical location is a consideration in determining an appropriate reassignment under the Rehabilitation Act, the reassignment obligation under the Act is not necessarily limited by the local commuting area. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii).

OPM's intent to provide restoration rights only in the local commuting area is also clear from its explanation for adding the limiting phrase in issuing the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McQueen v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 534-36 (1992), considered whether an agency must consider reassigning a disabled employee from one major organizational component of an agency to another, e.g., from INS to another DOJ agency. In a decision that would undergo some modification in <span class="Italic">Hurst v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 282 (1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">McQueen</span> decided that in most cases, the agency has no requirement to do so because of a presumed undue administrative burden that would accompany the interorganizational reassignment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We note that 29 USC 791(b), from which the necessity for providing reasonable accommodation is derived, imposes an obligation on each department, agency, and instrumentality in the executive branch to take affirmative action on behalf of handicapped applicants and employees. The section of the Act setting forth definitions contains no definition of agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 706. However, the implementing regulations, which were promulgated by the former Civil Service Commission and adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, specify that they apply to executive agencies as defined in 5 USC 105. <span class="Italic">See</span> [29 CFR 1614.103(b)(2)].Section 105 provides that for the purpose of that title, "executive agency" means an executive department, a government corporation, and an independent establishment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hancock v. Egger</span>, 848 F.2d 87 (6th Cir. 1988), a case involving the issue of the proper party defendant in a civil rights suit, the court construed executive agency in section 105 to exclude the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The court carefully explained why the IRS could not be considered any of the entities listed in section 105, that is, an executive department, a government corporation or an independent establishment, and in so doing, stated that the IRS is clearly <span class="Italic">a part</span> of an executive department. <span class="Italic">Hancock</span>, 848 F.2d at 89. Thus, component parts of agencies will not themselves be considered agencies. The <span class="Italic">Hancock</span> ruling is consistent with the ruling of other circuits which have held that the head of a component part of a department, agency or unit is not the proper party defendant under 29 USC 794a(a)(1) and 42 USC 2000e-16(c). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Long</span>, 861 F.2d 1346 (5th Cir. 1988) (commander of the Army and Air Force Exchange Service not the appropriate defendant). Therefore, we conclude that the Department of Justice is the "agency" that constitutes the outer limits of the appellant's potential right to accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency was not obligated to consider the appellant for vacant positions outside INS, the administrative judge noted that the appellant had not identified specific positions outside INS. However, in <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378 n.5, the Board found that, to satisfy the requirement to articulate a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t suffices for an employee to set out her educational background and skills qualifying her for consideration for reassignment to another position, since the agency is in a better position to match the employee's capabilities with available jobs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 55, 63 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is not required to consider every possible reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 691, 693 n.3 (1988). However, while an agency's duty to accommodate an employee's handicap is not unlimited, there must be a reasonable attempt to accommodate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPB 626, 7 MSPR 13, 17 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 23 MSPR 682, 686 (1984). In this case, the record indicates that the agency did not consider the appellant for any positions in the Department of Justice that were outside INS. Therefore, we must now decide whether its failure to do so is a violation of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is not required to provide accommodation if it establishes that to do so would create an undue hardship, an undue administrative <span id="Page_3509"></span>or financial burden, or would result in a substantial modification of job requirements, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378; <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. In general, each component part of an agency has a mission that is separate and independent of the other component parts of the agency, a separate and independent appointing authority, a separate and independent budget allocation, and a separate and independent full-time equivalency allocation. Therefore, requiring an agency to consider reassignment of a qualified handicapped employee to any and all of its component parts, in most instances, will impose a severe administrative burden upon the agency involved. Thus, we hold that there is a rebuttable presumption that accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee by reassignment from one component part of an agency to another component part would create an undue administrative burden upon the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 379.[3] Of course, an appellant may still show that an agency's articulated reason was merely a pretext for handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 168 n.4 (1988); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 155 (1988). Thus, even if the appellant has not rebutted the presumption of undue burden, an agency may still want to submit evidence of undue burden, rather than simply rely on the presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3] We note that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued a final rule on handling discrimination charges. In doing so, it recognized the argument advanced by some agencies and by the Office of Personnel Management that it is impractical and extremely difficult to reassign employees from one agency component to another. Thus, it revised 29 CFR 1614.203(g) to require reassignment only to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority unless the agency can demonstrate that the reassignment would impose undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Final Rule on Handling Discrimination Charges, 43 Daily Lab. Rel. Rep. (BNA) at F-10 and F-38 (Mar. 4, 1992). Although this rule does not become effective until October 1, 1992, and therefore is not binding on this case, the limited scope of reassignment set out in revised 29 CFR 1614.203(g) further evidences the reasonableness of the Board's position in this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the issue of whether reassignment to a position outside INS would impose an undue burden on the agency was not the focus of the parties' arguments because, of course, they were unaware of the Board's holding in this case. Thus, we find it appropriate to remand this case to allow the parties to present additional argument and evidence on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McQueen</span> was extended in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 537, 541-44 (1992): within a military entity, "a single military department, and not the Department of Defense," should define the limits of an employee's potential right to accommodation. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Navy looked for possible reassignments for the appellant within his department, in accordance with internal regulations, and, finding none, looked to other departments within his activity. The question then surfaced as to whether the Navy was obliged to look for positions to accommodate the appellant outside his shipyard. The Board ducked the issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recently considered the issue of what organizational unit within an agency represents the outermost limit with regard to the agency's obligation to consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation for a qualified handicapped employee. In <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Department of Justice,</span> 53 MSPR 530, 534-535 (1992), the Board held that the Department of Justice, and not its component part, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, constituted the outer limits of the appellant's potential right to accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board reasoned that: (1) The implementing regulations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 specify at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.701(b) that they apply to executive agencies as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 105; (2) "Executive agency" means an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment; and (3) pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 101, the Department of Justice is an Executive department.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 101 of Title 5 USC, however, lists as an Executive Department the Department of Defense and not specifically the Department of the Navy or any of the other military departments. This would suggest a broad right of reassignment throughout the Department of Defense. The Board has recently found, however, that the military departments were intended to function, at least with regard to personnel matters, with the independence that generally characterizes executive departments outside the Department of Defense, rather than the limited kind of independence that generally characterizes organizations within those departments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy,</span> 53 MSPR 545 (1992), the Board considered whether service in one military department was creditable toward completion of a probationary period in another military department. To resolve this issue, the Board examined the 1949 legislation that redesignated as military departments the departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, formerly executive departments. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Security Act Amendments of 1949, Pub. L. 81-216, &#x00A7; 4, 63 Stat. 578. The Board noted Congress' statement that, while the amendments were designed to integrate the policies and procedures for the departments, agencies, and functions of the Government relating to national security, they were not intended to merge the military departments, which would be separately administered by their respective Secretaries under the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2 and 4; <span class="Italic">Francis,</span> at 550. The Board further noted that, in the Senate Report accompanying the legislation, Congress referred to the removal of the military departments from the list of executive departments, and to the addition of the Department of Defense in their place, as a "[t]echnical change," and indicated its "inten[tion] to emphasize the adherence to the three department principle...by insuring that each of the three military departments shall be administered as departments and not merged into one administrative grouping." S. Rep. No. 366, 81st Cong., 1st Sess. (1949), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1949 USCCS 1771, 1776-77. The Board found, therefore, that, based on the statute's legislative history, the military departments are to be regarded as separate agencies for purposes related to the appointment and employment of civilian personnel, and that service in one military department is not creditable toward completion of a probationary period in another. <span class="Italic">Francis</span>, at 551.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this same analysis supports the position that a single military department, and not the Department of Defense, should define the limits of an employee's potential right to accommodation. Decisions of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency exclusively charged with interpreting the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations, <span class="Italic">Ignacio v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 30 MSPR 471, 485 (Spec. Pan. 1986), are in accord; that is to say, EEOC does not require one military department to consider positions in other military departments with regard to a qualified handicapped employee's right to reassignment as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roberson v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03900079 (Oct. 30, 1990); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03890111 (July 30, 1990); <span class="Italic">Guillot v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03890008 (Jan. 5, 1990); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03870172 (Mar. 24, 1989). An administrative agency's interpretation of an act with whose implementation it is charged is generally entitled to great deference unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the act. <span class="Italic">Bost v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 MSPR 310, 314 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, based on the above, we find that the Department of the Navy is the "agency" that constitutes the outer limits of the appellant's right to accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act. On the other hand, to the extent that the agency's internal regulation would purport to narrow the scope of reassignment under these circumstances, such a regulation cannot override an agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding our holding above, an agency is not required to provide accommodation if it establishes that to do so would create an undue hardship, an undue administrative or financial burden, or would result in a substantial modification of job requirements. <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378; <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 153 (1988). In <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, the Board stated that because, in general, the mission, appointing authority, budget allocation, and full-time equivalency allocation of each component part of an agency is separate and independent from the other component parts of the agency, it would impose a severe administrative burden upon an agency to require that it consider reassignment of a qualified handicapped employee to any and all of its component parts. <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, at 535. Accordingly, the Board held that there is a rebuttable presumption that accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee by reassignment from one component part of an agency to another component part would create an undue administrative burden upon the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 535-536.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record shows that the agency did not consider the appellant for any positions in the Department of the Navy outside of the Shipyard. However, the issue of whether reassignment to a position outside the Shipyard would impose an undue burden on the agency was not the focus of the parties' arguments because, of course, they were unaware of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>. Thus, we find it appropriate to remand this case to allow the parties to present additional argument and evidence on this issue. In this regard, we note that an appellant may still show that an agency's articulated reason was merely a pretext for handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 168 n.4 (1988); <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 155. Thus, even if the appellant has not rebutted the presumption of undue burden, an agency may still want to submit evidence of undue burden, rather than simply rely on the presumption.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant preserved this issue, the Board decided long ago that an agency is not obligated to extend beyond itself its search for a vacant position to which an employee in need of an accommodation could be assigned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown v.

West</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03970024, 1997 EEOPUB LEXIS 1397, at *24 (1997) ("when an agency has reasonably considered reassignment, it is not required to consider reassignment ad infinitum")....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board narrowed the duty of accommodation through reassignment in <span class="Italic">Gumper v. DOJ</span>, 55 MSPR 173, 176-78 (1992), allowing agencies to limit reassignment searches to the commuting area of the appellant's position. The Board added a few comments concerning proof and disproof of the rebuttable presumption of burden arising out of a reassignment among component parts of an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the parties agreed that the appellant was a handicapped person. The administrative judge did not specifically determine whether the appellant was a qualified handicapped employee. However, we find from the record below that the appellant was a qualified handicapped employee because he articulated a reasonable accommodation of reassignment and the agency offered to reassign him to a GS-6 Law Enforcement Communications Assistant position, thus acknowledging his status as a qualified handicapped employee. Under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, an agency has a duty to accommodate a qualified handicapped employee, unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would create an undue hardship, such as an undue administrative or financial burden, or would require a substantial modification of job requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 378 (1988). Reassignment to a vacant position that the appellant can perform with or without accommodation may be a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency attempted to reassign the appellant by searching for a vacant position for which the appellant qualified within the same commuting area and served by the same appointing authority of the agency. Agency witness Ellen De La Cruz, a Personnel Management Specialist, testified that she searched for a vacant position within the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol, a component of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which in turn is a component of the Department of Justice. She did not expand her search beyond the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol because she believed that Office of Personnel Management regulations at 5 CFR 844.102 and agency regulations required no more. Her search revealed one position for which the appellant qualified and that was within his medical restrictions. Accordingly, the agency offered the appellant the position of GS-6 Law Enforcement Communications Assistant, with retained pay. The appellant declined the reassignment. The administrative judge, after considering the testimony and evidence, determined that the agency met its obligation to accommodate the appellant's handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that the agency did not search thoroughly and beyond the San Diego sector for a position at his grade level. Since the administrative judge issued his remand initial decision, we have held that an agency's obligation to accommodate a qualified handicapped employee by reassignment potentially encompasses the entire agency<span class="Italic">. McQueen v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 533-35 (1992) (the Department of Justice, and not merely its component part, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, constituted the outer limits of the appellants potential right to accommodation). Thus, in this appeal, the scope of the agency's obligation to accommodate the appellant potentially encompasses not just the Border Patrol and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but the Department of Justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold in this appeal that an agency's obligation to accommodate by reassignment is limited to a search for a vacant position located within the commuting area to which a qualified handicapped employee is presently assigned. In deciding the issue of the scope of an agency's duty to accommodate by reassignment in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, we were guided by Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) revised regulations that become effective October 1, 1992. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 536 n.3. The EEOC, which is the agency exclusively charged with interpreting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, has revised its regulations to provide that "an agency shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority..." 57 Fed. Reg. 12,652 (1992) (to be codified at 29 CFR 1614.203(g)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 536 n.3. Although this regulation does not become effective until October 1, 1992, and therefore is not binding in this appeal, the limited scope of reassignment set out in revised 29 CFR 1614.203(g) further evidences the reasonableness of the Board's position in this matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 536 n.3; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 537, 543 (1992). Thus, we find in this appeal that the agency need not search beyond the commuting area for a vacant position to which the appellant can be reassigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, as noted above, an agency is not required to provide accommodation if it establishes that such accommodation would create an undue hardship, such as an undue administrative or financial burden, or would require a substantial modification of job requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 53 MSPR at 543-44; <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 535; <span class="Italic">Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378. Requiring an agency to consider reassignment of a qualified handicapped employee to any and all of its component parts, in most instances, will impose a severe administrative burden upon the agency involved, giving rise to a rebuttable presumption that such an accommodation would create an undue administrative burden. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 53 MSPR at 544; <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 535-36.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presumption of an undue burden is based on our finding that, in general, each component part of an agency has a mission that is separate and independent of the other component parts of the agency, a separate and independent appointing authority, a separate and independent budget allocation, and a separate and independent full-time equivalency allocation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 53 MSPR at 544; <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 535-36. Agency witness De La Cruz testified that the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol had its own appointing authority. Nevertheless, that evidence alone is not sufficient to establish that the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol constitutes a component part of the agency, so as to give rise to the presumption that reassigning the appellant outside that component part would place an undue burden on the agency. Moreover, the appellant has not had an opportunity to rebut any presumption of undue burden that may arise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we remand this appeal to the regional office. With the parameters cited above as a guide, the administrative judge shall afford the parties an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the issue of whether a rebuttable presumption exists, including a further hearing if requested by the appellant. The administrative judge shall also afford the appellant an opportunity to rebut the presumption that reassigning the appellant from one component part of the agency to another component part would create an undue administrative burden upon the agency by showing that the agency's articulated reason is merely a pretext for handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 53 MSPR at 544; <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, 53 MSPR at 536. Of course, the agency may also submit evidence on this issue, rather than simply rely on a presumption of an undue burden.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Citing guidance from EEOC, the Board confirmed its retreat from the position that agencies have a responsibility to reassign across organizational lines served by separate appointing authorities within a given commuting area, <span class="Italic">Hurst v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 281-82 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the agency was required to place him at the Base, an agency component within the same commuting area, but served by a separate appointing authority. The agency responds that it has no obligation to seek placement beyond a single appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several recent Board decisions found that an agency may be required to seek reassignment of a qualified handicapped employee from one component of an agency to another within the same commuting area, but that such a reassignment raises a rebuttable presumption of undue burden upon the agency. <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 535-36 (1992); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 537, 543-44 (1992); <span class="Italic">Gumper v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 173, 177-78 (1992). In these cases, the Board cited to revised Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulations, not then effective, which provided that "an agency shall offer to reassign the [handicapped] individual to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority."...&#8197;The Board interpreted the EEOC's limitation on the scope of reassignment as consistent with its own position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, the EEOC, interpreting its own regulations, found that the Board in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span> had erred both in holding that a handicapped appellant's accommodation rights may extend beyond parts of an agency served by the same appointing authority, and in shifting the burden of proof in such instances to the appellant. <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Reno</span>, EEOC No. 03930006 (May 26, 1993). However, because the EEOC ultimately concurred in the result reached by the Board in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, the Board did not have occasion to address this split in authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In taking up the issue here, we make reference to the general principle that the Board lacks authority to disagree with a decision of the EEOC which rests upon an interpretation of discrimination law, and which is not so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law....&#8197;We find, moreover, that the EEOC decision, in defining the scope of accommodation an agency must extend to a handicapped employee, clearly rests upon an interpretation of discrimination law....&#8197;Further, that decision, as well as the EEOC's implementing regulation to the same effect, are not so unreasonable as to represent a violation of civil service law. Thus, although we are not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, bound by the EEOC's decision in <span id="Page_3511"></span><span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, for these reasons we find it appropriate to defer to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the Shipyard and the Base are served by separate appointing authorities. We therefore find that the agency was not required to seek placement of the appellant beyond the Shipyard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sapp v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 189, 195 (1997) (comparing the agency's placement obligations to disabled employees with their obligations to employees entitled to restoration following partial recovery from a compensable illness or injury).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Barth v. Gelb</span>, 2 F.3d 1180, 1182-90 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the District of Columbia Circuit considered in a claim of disability discrimination by an employee of the Voice of America who sought a reassignment from his position at the Washington Headquarters of VOA into the Foreign Service component of VOA that maintained overseas radio relay stations. In the course of the discussion, the circuit analyzed the burden of proof in disability discrimination cases, particularly regarding undue hardship claims, and the court concluded that the plaintiff was not entitled to accommodation for his medical condition through a reassignment that would alter the agency's method of rotating personnel among its relay stations. The court also expressed its approval of distinctions in treatment of accommodation claims by employees and applicants for employment (or applicants for reassignment into different components of an agency):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Donald Barth, a severe diabetic, appeals a judgment in favor of his employer, the Voice of America, on his claim that the VOA illegally discriminated on the basis of handicap by failing to clear him for service at the VOA's overseas radio relay stations....&#8197;Mr. Barth's principal challenge is directed to the court's allocation to him of the ultimate burden of proof on that issue. Because a claim of undue burden is an affirmative defense in actions under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, we find that the burden of proving it should have been placed on the VOA. But because we also find that this error was harmless, we affirm the district court's judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Donald Barth is a Washington-based computer specialist and employee of the VOA who decided he wanted a change in assignments and a chance to see the world. Accordingly, in 1988, he applied for admittance into the permanent Foreign Service, out of which engineering positions at the VOA's twelve overseas radio relay stations are staffed. Mr. Barth passed all requirements for admittance into the Service, except that he failed a State Department medical clearance examination designed to assess his availability for worldwide service. Mr. Barth suffers from an advanced and degenerative form of diabetes requiring the care of a skilled endocrinologist to control the diabetes, plus an array of other specialists (in ophthalmology, for example) to control its complications. The State Department found that Mr. Barth could not serve worldwide, but only in locations with advanced medical facilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the denial of the medical clearance, Mr. Barth requested a medical waiver from the VOA. His particular suggestion was that the VOA grant a limited waiver restricting his assignments to posts with suitable medical facilities. After protracted deliberations, the VOA denied Mr. Barth's waiver request without a written statement of reasons. Upon exhausting his administrative remedies, Mr. Barth brought suit under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 USC 701-796i (1988), asking the court to order his assignment to a suitable overseas relay station position and to award him backpay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Barth's principal claim is that he was improperly assigned the burden of proving that the requested accommodation would not constitute an undue hardship....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 governs employee claims of handicap discrimination against the Federal Government. Its basic tenet is that the Government must take reasonable affirmative steps to accommodate the handicapped, except where undue hardship would result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As originally enacted, section 501 of the Act simply spurred governmental efforts to employ the handicapped through such measures as affirmative action plans and review committees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 791. Section 504 of the Act prohibited discrimination against the handicapped by recipients of federal funds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. 794.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, however, Congress decided that stronger measures were needed on behalf of persons subjected to handicap discrimination by government agencies; and it enacted several provisions to supply them. Among these was section 505(a)(1), 29 USC 794a(a)(1), which allows private litigants to enforce rights under section 501 in suits employing the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16)." That section appears in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is entitled "Equal Employment Opportunity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, Congress expanded section 504 to cover federal agencies as well as recipients of federal funds and revised it to require the promulgation of regulations "to carry out" the amendments. <span class="Italic">See</span> Rehabilitation, Comprehensive Services, and Developmental Disabilities Amendments of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-602, 119, 92 Stat. 2955, 2982 (1978). Congress also added section 505(a)(2), 29 USC 794a(a)(2), which provides that the "remedies, procedures, and rights" set forth in Title VI ("Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs") of the Civil Rights Act be available in connection with complaints under section 504. Because these statutes are duplicative, some courts have limited claims against the Government as employer to actions brought under section 501, while others have allowed litigants to proceed under either provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Milbert v. Koop</span>, 830 F.2d 354, 357 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (collecting cases). We have "strongly suggest[ed] " that litigants proceed under section 501, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 357; and Mr. Barth has complied with this suggestion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A principal issue under the Act is whether the rights Congress so clearly enacted are to be enforced through the adaptation of civil rights law or through the promulgation of administrative regulations. In light of section 505(a)(1)'s terse command that the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act" be made available in connection with complaints brought under section 501, it would seem reasonable for courts to look to the body of law developed under Title VII for guidance in enforcing comparable rights protected under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Milbert</span>, 830 F.2d at 356 (section 501 "incorporate[s] " Title VII provisions); <span class="Italic">Judd v. Billington</span>, 863 F.2d 103, 105 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 717 of the Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000e-16, prohibits discrimination in Federal employment on the basis of "race, color, religion, sex or national origin." Under section 2000e-16, the closest analogy to discrimination on the basis of handicap is discrimination on the basis of religion. Whereas race, color, sex, and national origin are nearly always irrelevant to an employee's ability to perform a federal job, handicaps, like religious beliefs, are of a great variety and are often relevant to an employee's job performance. Under Title VII, employers may not discriminate on the basis of religion, which is defined to include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to reasonably accommodate to an employee's or prospective employee's religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct of the employer's business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. 2000e(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An alternative, but related, source of authority defining the rights of the handicapped under sections 501 and 504 are the regulations promulgated, respectively, by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") and the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"). These regulations, which are substantially identical, are codified at 29 CFR 1613.704 (1992) and 45 CFR 84.12 (1992) respectively. Each is entitled "Reasonable accommodation" and, as is clear from their references to undue hardship, each is modeled on Title VII's prohibition of religious discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations promulgated under section 501, with which we are here concerned, contain the following relevant provisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1613.702 Definitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Handicapped person</span> is defined...as one who...[h]as a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Qualified handicapped person</span> means with respect to employment, a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1613.704 Reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;An agency shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to: (1) Making facilities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, and (2) job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the agency in question, factors to be considered include: (1) The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the composition and structure of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and the cost of the accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3512"></span>29 CFR 1613.702, 1613.704. These regulations have remained unchanged since before the adoption of the Rehabilitation Act's 1978 amendments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A court's allocation of the burdens of proof in a federal agency handicap discrimination case will be determined in part by whether the court looks to Title VII case law or to the EEOC regulations for guidance. The EEOC regulations direct that "[A]n agency shall make reasonable accommodation [for qualified handicapped persons] unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program." 29 CFR 1613.704(a). This rule apparently calls for a two-part approach in which plaintiffs bear their usual burden of showing a breach of duty--namely, that they are qualified handicapped persons who have been denied reasonable accommodations for their handicaps--but in which agencies may "demonstrate," as an affirmative defense, that fulfilling this duty would impose "undue hardships" on their programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 505(a)(1), on the other hand, states, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 USC 2000e-16)...shall be available, with respect to any complaint under section 791 of this title, to any employee or applicant for employment aggrieved by the final disposition of such complaint....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 USC 794a(a)(1). Section 717 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Yet, although religious discrimination is a closer analog to handicap discrimination than either race or sex discrimination, courts focusing on this language have tended to look to the allocations of the burdens of proof developed for Title VII race and sex discrimination complaints in shaping rules under the Rehabilitation Act....&#8197;Thus, courts allocating burdens of proof under the Rehabilitation Act have been prone to adapt and employ the familiar principles of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> as elaborated by <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Burdine</span> places on the plaintiff an initial burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. If the plaintiff establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden shifts to the defendant, which must then produce evidence of an articulable non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action. If the defendant produces such a reason, the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the reason was pretextual and that intentional discrimination had in fact occurred. <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. at 252-56, 101 S. Ct. at 1093-95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The allocation of the burdens of production in the first two steps is designed to "sharpen the inquiry" into an "elusive" fact--an employer's discriminatory motivation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255 n.8, 101 S. Ct. at 1094 n.8. Because of the difficulties inherent in establishing such motivation, the Supreme Court placed only a modest initial burden on a Title VII plaintiff; namely, that he establish that although qualified for an available position, he was "rejected under circumstances which give rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1094. Once this burden is met, it becomes necessary for the employer to produce admissible evidence of legitimate reasons for the plaintiff's rejection, thus "fram[ing] the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 255-56, 101 S. Ct. at 1094-95. Such a demonstration having been made, it remains the plaintiff's ultimate burden to show that he was in fact the victim of intentional discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 253, 101 S. Ct. at 1093-94; <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2748-49, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). In short, the requirement of only a minimal <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing strips the defendant of the ability to remain silent as to its motive while recognizing the plaintiff's ultimate obligation to prove that motive's illegality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual bringing an action under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, however, may face a quite different situation from that faced by plaintiffs charging racial discrimination under Title VII. Unlike a person's race, an employer may legitimately take a handicap into consideration in determining whether an applicant or employee is qualified for a particular position. Thus, while an agency would never admit to basing an employment decision on race, agencies frequently acknowledge that they have taken a person's handicap into consideration. Under such circumstances, the ultimate purpose of <span class="Italic">Burdine's</span> requirements is typically achieved from the outset. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. New York University</span>, 666 F.2d 761, 776 (2d Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is apparent, then, that the <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> test is not equally applicable to all cases brought under section 501. To illustrate this point, we describe three of the various categories of handicap discrimination cases that may be brought under that section. The first is one in which the employing agency asserts that it refused a job application, or denied an employee a promotion or discharged him, for reasons unrelated to the person's handicap....&#8197;A second category involves suits in which the employer challenges a plaintiff's claim that he is a "qualified handicapped person" who, with "reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question." 29 CFR 1613.702(f). In these cases, the agency will usually contend that no reasonable accommodation is available. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Treadwell v. Alexander</span>, 707 F.2d 473, 476, 478 (11th Cir. 1983) (agency permitted to refuse employment to a person capable of walking only one mile per day when its job requirements include the ability to walk six hours per day and stand for another hour)...&#8197;In a third category we have those cases, such as the one before us, in which the employing agency offers the affirmative defense of "undue hardship on the operation of its program." 29 CFR 1613.704(a). This last may at times merge with the second, however, as indicated by the regulation's reference to "the nature and the cost" of a proposed accommodation as an example of "undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 1613.704(c)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first of these categories involves the sort of inquiry into subjective facts--the employing agency's true motivation--that the <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> three-step approach was designed to address. But in the last two categories, the fact that the plaintiff's handicap was taken into explicit account in the agency's employment or personnel decision is acknowledged. These cases deal with objective claims that may be tested through the application of traditional burdens of proof. In the second category, for example, a plaintiff must establish that (a) he is handicapped but, (b) with reasonable accommodation (which he must describe), he is (c) able to perform "the essential functions" of the position he holds or seeks. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.702(f); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. 1613.704(a), (b). As in the usual case, it would then be up to the employing agency to refute that evidence. The burden, however, remains with the plaintiff to prove his case by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the third category, the agency invokes the affirmative defense of "undue hardship," an inquiry for which the regulations provide three factors for consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The overall size of the agency's program with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities and size of budget; (2) the type of agency operation, including the composition and structure of the agency's work force; and (3) the nature and the cost of the accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR 1613.704(c). In such a case (as in any other in which an affirmative defense is raised) the agency has the burden of proving the undue hardship....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general matter, a reasonable accommodation is one employing a <span class="Italic">method of accommodation</span> that is reasonable in the run of cases, whereas the undue hardship inquiry focuses on the hardships imposed by the plaintiff's preferred accommodation in the context of the particular agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1613.704(b) (listing various reasonable methods of accommodation as examples of "reasonable accommodation"); 29 CFR 1613.704(c) (listing considerations bearing on undue hardship by reference to the hardship imposed on "the agency in question"). As noted earlier, a grey area will arise where a proposed accommodation is so costly or of such a nature that it would impose an undue burden on the employer's operations. Thus, an accommodation would be both unreasonable and impose an undue burden "if it either imposes undue financial and administrative burdens on [an agency] or requires a fundamental alteration in the nature of [its] program...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the issue has been joined in a manner that places us squarely within the third category described above. Therefore, the district court erred in two respects on the question of burdens of proof: Because the VOA acknowledged that it had refused Mr. Barth's application on account of his handicap, the court should not have invoked the <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> three-step scheme; and, more to the point, it wrongly assigned the burden of persuasion on the undue hardship issue to Mr. Barth instead of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VOA does not claim that limiting Mr. Barth's overseas assignments to posts at which adequate medical facilities are available would be unreasonable in the abstract. Rather, it asserts that the requested accommodation would result in undue hardship as a result of considerations peculiar to its operation; essentially, its need for flexibility in the difficult task of rotating a small number of radio engineering specialists among twelve far-flung relay stations, most of them "hardship posts," while trying to maintain the efficiency of its operation. The VOA notes that its non-hardship posts, the only ones at which Mr. Barth would be eligible to serve, function as short-term havens for its specialists. Yet, given the "thin staffing" of VOA posts, every transfer from, say, Liberia to Munich, Germany, implies the need for another transfer in the opposite direction. Mr. Barth, however, would be medically disqualified for such transfers, thereby imposing additional burdens on the remaining engineers. For these and other operational reasons, the VOA maintains that its staffing problems would be greatly compounded by admitting someone into the Service who from the outset had Mr. Barth's serious limitations on assignability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The accommodation Mr. Barth seeks is assignment to one of three or four "non-hardship" posts in the VOA radio relay system. As the VOA admits that it restricts the assignments of certain of its current radio specialists for medical and family reasons, there can be no claim that such an accommodation would mark a "fundamental alteration" in the nature <span id="Page_3513"></span>of the VOA's program. The agency argues instead that permanently assigning Mr. Barth to non-hardship postings would impose, in these particular circumstances, undue hardship on the VOA. This is an affirmative defense that the VOA had the burden of proving. The issue to be resolved, then, is whether it has met that burden. But because the district court erred in assigning the ultimate burden of proof to Mr. Barth, we must also decide whether that error was harmless....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Barth does not claim that the Government failed to produce evidence of undue hardship. Therefore, the only conceivable prejudice from the district court's error is the possibility that its misallocation of the ultimate burden of proof affected the outcome of the case. For this to occur, the evidence presented would have to be in sufficient balance so that the outcome would depend on who had the burden....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the district court examined the administrative record and concluded that the VOA's decision that Mr. Barth's handicap could not be reasonably accommodated "was proper and consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act." The court observed that "[t]he thin staffing at each post required flexibility of assignment, put a premium on workers not subject to serious health risks, and offered few options for initial assignment of Mr. Barth." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It found that "at the time he sought waiver Mr. Barth could function only at three or four posts." <span class="Italic">Id</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our examination of the records satisfies us that the VOA introduced sufficient evidence to support a claim of undue hardship by virtue of the loss of essential operational flexibility that would have resulted from an attempt to accommodate Mr. Barth's medical needs. And because Mr. Barth does not challenge the district court's findings of fact, we must accept those findings as true. Viewing the evidence through the lens of those findings, we conclude that it was not so closely balanced that the court's error in assigning the burden of persuasion to Mr. Barth would have affected the outcome.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Barth asserts...that the court erred in allowing the VOA to refuse to offer an accommodation to an applicant for employment that it has extended to current employees. Mr. Barth notes that the VOA has made special accommodations for employees who have incurred medical problems while on duty overseas or whose children have particular educational needs. From this, he argues that (1) if such limitations on the assignment of an existing employee do not create an undue hardship, similar restrictions on the assignment of an applicant will not do so; and (2) if the VOA restricts the assignments of a current employee for medical or family reasons, it must be equally willing to restrict the assignment of a handicapped applicant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These arguments overlook the benefits that agencies derive from accommodating the special needs of existing employees, which they do not gain from serving those of applicants. A willingness to accommodate incumbent employees increases the likelihood that they--and their knowhow--will be retained by the employing agency. It will also contribute to employee morale and, presumably, to productivity. Thus there is economic logic as well as moral truth behind the intuition that distinguishes between "family" and "stranger" and the level of obligation owed to each....&#8197;Mr. Barth may knock at the door, but he is not family, and his handicap does not give him the right to be treated as such. An agency is entitled both to take the measure of the burden imposed by an accommodation net of its benefits and to take account of the duty of care, whether legal or not, that is owed employees who develop problems while on the job. Accordingly, we decline to find that the disparate treatment Mr. Barth complains of constitutes handicap discrimination within the meaning of the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his second claim of legal error, Mr. Barth argues that the district court improperly accepted "speculative assertions of impaired management flexibility and employee morale." He contends that an agency "must establish 'undue hardship' through objective evidence, not mere supposition, of the actual impact of any proposed accommodation on specific aspects of its program." He supports this argument with statements from Title VII religious discrimination cases....&#8197;We, however, find nothing in these cases more remarkable than the proposition that evidence becomes less persuasive as it becomes more speculative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Barth also contends that even if the VOA had offered admissible evidence of an adverse effect on employee morale, it was inappropriate to take that factor into account. For support, he relies on cases holding, for example, that racial animus may not be used to defend race-based policies or practices....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument, however, confuses animus against the handicapped with the morale effects of a particular means of accommodating them. Consider an extreme example: An agency is asked to accommodate an employee with extra-sensitive eyes by moving operations underground. It seems clear that in considering this request, the agency could not properly take into account the other workers' animus against the handicapped or their resentment over the handicapped's protected legal status. But this does not mean the agency must ignore the probable effects of subterranean working conditions on the morale of other employees, however pure of heart.</p>
