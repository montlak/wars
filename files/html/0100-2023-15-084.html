<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-84"><span class="space">e.</span> Reassignment to Nonsensitive Position; Mitigation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Egan</span> suggested that the Board could determine "whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible." <span class="Italic">Griffin v. DMA</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1989), considered whether an agency is required to search for an alternate position that does not require a clearance when it decides to revoke or deny a clearance necessary for an employee's current position. Construing the phrase in the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> that "the Board may determine...whether transfer is feasible," the court found no duty to locate alternate positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We see this passage as recognition of a Board role in reviewing the feasibility of transfer to a nonsensitive position if that substantive right is available from some other source, such as a statute or regulation....&#8197;Absent that, the Board has no authority to inquire into the feasibility of transfer to alternative positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The case law is clear that, if...[an] employee cannot do his job, he can be fired, and the employer is not required to assign him to alternative employment."...&#8197;Even under the Rehabilitation Act of 1978...where there is a duty to reasonably accommodate handicapped employees, the employer is not required to "find another job for an employee who is not qualified for the job he or she was doing...[unless there are] alternative employment opportunities reasonably available under the employer's existing policies."...&#8197;That means that if the Defense Mapping Agency had an "existing policy," manifested by regulation, to transfer applicants who unsuccessfully seek a security clearance to nonsensitive positions if available, it could be held to that policy and the Board could review its efforts. In the absence of this policy, the Board has no role.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 584, 589 &#x00B6; 8, 2014 MSPB 74 (2014), involving a removal based on inability to hold a noncritical sensitive position, applied the line of decisions to a mitigation argument:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court held that the Board does not have authority to review the substance of a security clearance determination, contrary to what is required generally in other adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530-31. The Court held that, in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 based on the denial of a security clearance, the Board has authority to review only whether: (1) an executive branch employer determined that the employee's position required a security clearance; (2) the clearance was denied or revoked; (3) the employee was provided with the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513; and (4) transfer to a non-sensitive position was feasible when another source, such as a statute or regulation, provides the employee a substantive right to such reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d at 1151 (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530); <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 14 n.5 (2014). The Court ruled that "[n]othing in the [statute enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513]...direct[ed] or empower[ed] the Board to go further." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530. Our review is therefore limited to the issues set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zadzielski v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 464 Fed. Appx. 902, 904 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP) (Navy had no policy requiring assignment of an employee to a nonsensitive position in lieu of an indefinite suspension based on suspension of a required clearance); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 235, 238 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP) ("To the extent that Ms. Phillips is arguing that she should have been reassigned to a position that did not require a security clearance, the Board's review of the penalty imposed upon her was limited to considering whether the Air Force has a formal policy requiring reassignment, and if so, whether there is a position to which she could have been reassigned. <span class="Italic">Blagaich v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, under the Supreme Court's decision in Egan, the feasibility of reassignment under these circumstances is not entirely within management's discretion but is subject to review by the Board. 108 S.

We find that the Board cannot uphold an employee's removal as "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service" unless the agency shows the employee could not feasibly be reassigned to work for which a clearance is not required. It is the agency's burden, as part of its case in chief, to show it could not reassign appellant to a nonsensitive position within the facility where he was employed because there were no available nonsensitive positions for which appellant was qualified.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the remand proceedings in <span class="Italic">Van Duzer,</span> the case returned to the Board on PFR, and the Board used that opportunity to square its analysis with the intervening <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> decision from its reviewing court, <span class="Italic">Van Duzer v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant also reiterates his contentions that the agency improperly imposed the security clearance requirement on his position, even though we held in our prior decision on review that the imposition of such a requirement is not within the Board's review authority. <span class="Italic">See VanDuzer,</span> 39 MSPR at 204 &#x0026; n.4.

<p class="Block-Quote2">To the extent that the appellant argues that he could have been accommodated in his position by controlling his access to secure areas, we also find that such accommodation is precluded by the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Griffin v.

Cir. 1989), which we follow in this decision below to find that the Board does not have the authority to review agency efforts to reassign an employee who had not maintained his security clearance, unless agency regulations afford that employee such right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, since our August 15, 1988 remand decision, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has ruled in <span class="Italic">Griffin v.</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency,</span> 864 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1989), that such reassignment efforts are not necessarily required. The court noted that "whether there is an <span id="Page_2549"></span>obligation for the government to search out alternative employment for federal employees hired for positions requiring a security clearance who fail to get it was not an issue in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>" and that the Supreme Court would not, in its view, "[have] so casually created a new substantive requirement never thought to exist before." <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1580.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit explained that, in stating that the Board "may determine...whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible," the Supreme Court was simply recognizing "the Board['s] role in reviewing the feasibility of transfer to a nonsensitive position if that substantive right is available from some other source, such as a statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1580, citing <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Department of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1989).[2] The Federal Circuit further held in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 864 F.2d at 1580, that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513 created no such general right, however, and noted that it was unaware of any other such statutory requirement. The Federal Circuit concluded that, since there was no showing of an existing agency policy to reassign employees to alternative positions where feasible as manifested by regulation, the Board's inquiry was over once it determined that the employee had failed to obtain a security clearance and that he had received the procedural protections of section 7513. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1581.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Lyles,</span> 864 F.2d at 1583, the Federal Circuit held that, in order to show harmful procedural error based on an agency regulation giving the employee the right to be considered for another position, the employee must show that transfer was feasible where the agency has unsuccessfully conducted a search to find a vacant alternate position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Skees v. Department of the Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578, the Federal Circuit further held that, in the absence of such an agency regulation, the Board may not review the efforts that the agency does undertake.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant does not claim that the agency regulations give him a right to be considered for vacant nonsensitive positions.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lyles v. Dept. of Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583-84 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...When one is hired for a position he is expected to meet the requirements of that position. If he does not, he may be dismissed unless additional rights are available from some other source. Here Army Regulation 690-1 gave Lyles the right to be considered for another position.

The Army must abide by its own regulation, even if it is more rigorous than necessary....&#8197;And the Board, according to <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, may review the Army's efforts under this regulation to reposition Lyles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on this provision, Lyles alleges the Army committed harmful procedural error in not transferring him to a nonsensitive position....&#8197;The Board found that the Army conducted a search to find a vacant nonsensitive position and reported that none was available. It was then up to Lyles to show that transfer was feasible....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lyles presented a civilian personnel newsletter announcing open nonsensitive positions. The closing dates for applying for those positions, however, were before the date his removal was proposed, and there is no evidence he was qualified for them in any event....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moody v. DOD</span>, 247 Fed. Appx. 207, 208-09 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), concluded that there was no basis for reversal of a security clearance when an agency assigned the appellant nonsensitive duties pending a decision on her clearance revocation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Moody argues that the eleven-month delay between the revocation of her security clearance and the notification of her proposed suspension violated 5 C.F.R. Pt. 752 and DFAS 1426.1. Ms. Moody also contends that DFAS "set a preceden[t] when it allowed [her] to work over a year in a non-sensitive position even though [there] was no statute or regulation to substantiate [her] placement into a position other than the position [she] was hired for." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Ms. Moody argues that the eleven-month delay between the revocation of her security clearance and the notification of her proposed suspension violated 5 C.F.R. Pt. 752 and DFAS 1426.1, nothing in those regulations sets a rigid timetable for the government to initiate an adverse action. At best, DFAS 1426.1 merely requires disciplinary actions to be taken "promptly." However, Ms. Moody's indefinite suspension, although an adverse action, was not disciplinary in nature. Moreover, Ms. Moody has failed to demonstrate that the delay adversely affected her ability to defend herself, or otherwise affected the decision to indefinitely suspend her. Accordingly, her contention that the eleven-month delay between the revocation of her security clearance and the notification of her proposed suspension prejudiced her or violated the law is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DFAS also did not "set a preceden[t] when it allowed [her] to work over a year in a non-sensitive position." Simply put, the DFAS's effort to find Ms. Moody non-sensitive work following the revocation of her security clearance does not prevent it from subsequently suspending her for losing her security clearance or give her any vested interest in her interim duties. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578-79 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("We do not subscribe to the view that when [an agency], whether through benevolence or self-interest, tries to keep an employee who loses his security clearance aboard in another capacity, it thereby opens itself up to administrative and judicial second-guessing.").</p>

The Board did, however, give effect to a regulation obliging the agency to "make every effort" to reassign an employee who loses a security clearance.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further has found that an agency's adverse action based on the loss of a security clearance promotes the efficiency of the service because such a loss of access is "fatal to the job entitlement" and that the traditional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors penalty analysis generally does not apply. <span class="Italic">Munoz v.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, moreover, has reaffirmed that the Board may consider whether the employee could be reassigned to another position only when a "substantive right [to be transferred] is available from some other source, such as a statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 793 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2550"></span>We have considered the appellant's primary argument on review that the Board should exercise its mitigation authority under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> to impose some lesser, alternative penalty, and we find this argument is foreclosed by both our decisions and those of the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consistently has held that the Board "does not have the authority to review the feasibility of [a] reassignment in the absence of an additional agency regulation or policy statement providing for such transfer" in adverse action appeals based on the suspension or revocation of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Biggers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 745 F.3d 1360, 1362 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In response to similar arguments the appellant previously asserted in connection with her indefinite suspension, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's finding that it should not apply a traditional <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors penalty analysis to an adverse action involving either the suspension or revocation of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Ryan</span>, 793 F.3d at 1372-73; <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10. It would be wholly inconsistent for the Board to depart from these precedential decisions in this case and examine the reasonableness of the agency's removal penalty under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Ryan</span>, 793 F.3d at 1372 (explaining why the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors do not apply to the Board's review of a nondisciplinary adverse action involving a security clearance determination); <span class="Italic">see also Munoz</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the appellant's claim that she has a due process right to be considered for a lesser penalty, such as a reassignment. Specifically, we disagree with the appellant's suggestion that the Board has held that "there is a constitutional due process requirement for the agency to consider the several alternatives to a clearance-based removal." Instead, the Board has found that an appellant has a limited due process right to invoking the discretion of a deciding official who has the authority to select from alternative penalties, to the extent such alternatives are permitted, feasible, and within management's purview. <span class="Italic">See Putnam v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 8 (2014); <span class="Italic">see also Massey v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 226, &#x00B6; 4 (2013) (noting that the "root requirement" of due process is the opportunity to be heard (quoting <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 534 (1985)). The Board has never found that an appellant enjoys a substantive due process right to receive an alternative, lesser penalty. The nature of the Board's review of the reasonableness of an agency-imposed penalty derives from the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and is not a matter of constitutional right. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>, 793 F.3d at 1372 ("<span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, however, addressed the question of whether the [Board's] statutory authority 'includes authority to modify or reduce a penalty imposed on an employee by an agency's adverse action'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 313)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant, through counsel, presented a detailed oral reply to the deciding official in which she advocated for a reassignment in lieu of removal. The deciding official, moreover, testified at the hearing that she possessed the authority to reassign the appellant and that she considered the appellant's request but that she declined to exercise her authority under the facts of this case. We fully concur with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard was honored. <span class="Italic">See Putnam</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 532, &#x00B6; 12 (explaining that due process does not require a deciding official to have unfettered discretion to take any action she believes is appropriate).</p>
