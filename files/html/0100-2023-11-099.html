<p class="noindent">In conjunction with a grievance about arbitrary treatment, the union requested a recommendation from one management official to another concerning an employee's request for conversion to part-time employment. The information could be withheld, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union Local 6</span>, 26 FLRA 108, 112 (1987) <span id="Page_349"></span>(vacated and remanded, <span class="Italic">NLRB Union Local 6 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 483, 486-87 (D.C. Cir. 1988); on further review, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]ccess to internal management discussions and deliberations by a union or an employee results in a prohibited impact on management's decision making...concerning the exercise of a management right under section 7106. Information requested under 7114(b)(4) can be furnished only "to the extent not prohibited by law." Here we find that the information requested would improperly interject the Union into and give it access to management's internal decision making process involving decisions to take actions under section 7106. Specifically, we find that (1) the decision to deny the work schedule change is encompassed by management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B), and (2) the Regional Director's internal management recommendation was part of management's deliberative process. Accordingly, we conclude that disclosure of the details of that recommendation is "prohibited by law" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union was not entitled to documentation containing recommendations, concurrences, or opinions of supervisors or managers concerning disciplinary actions taken against unit employees and denials of employees' leave requests. As in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 26 FLRA 108 (1987), release of the disputed information interjected the union into, and gave it access to, management's internal decisionmaking process involving decisions to take certain actions under &#x00A7; 7106. The recommendations, concurrences, or opinions of supervisors or managers concerning those decisions were part of the management deliberative process. Release of the information was "prohibited by law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv., Nat'l Capitol Region, Park Police and Police Ass'n of Dist. of Columbia</span>, 26 FLRA 441, 443 (1987), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB Union Local 6 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 483, 487 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">post, following further remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>. As an exception to the "deliberative process" shield, management must turn over to the union memoranda that contain essentially factual statements. Apparently the recitation of facts does not reveal managerial deliberative processes. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv. and Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees, MEBA</span>, 30 FLRA 127, 142 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NLRB Union Local 6 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 483, 486 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (following further remand, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">The portion of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) relied upon by the Authority makes it inapplicable to data the disclosure of which is "prohibited by law." For it to be inapplicable under the reasoning and for the refusal to make disclosure to be proper by that reasoning, there must be something somewhere in its law that forbids that data's disclosure. Section 7106 does not contain that "something" and, therefore, cannot support the authority's decision. Section 7106 by any reading does not prohibit the disclosure of anything. All it does is reserve to management the authority to act in certain areas. Nothing in &#x00A7; 7106 prohibits management from disclosing any or all of the data relied upon or accumulated by it in acting within those areas. Indeed, &#x00A7; 7106(b) makes it plain that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--(1) at the election of the agency..." on many of the matters contained within the reservation....&#8197;The interpretation the Authority gives to this section is simply not a reasonable one and, indeed, is not an interpretation at all, but rather is a rewriting of the section....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Past decisions applying the "prohibited by law" exemption to the disclosure requirement have dealt with its interpretation in light of other sources of law, in fact, rendering the disclosure of certain information unlawful. Typically, this is focused on the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act...and the Privacy Act....&#8197;This would appear from the plain language of the involved statutes to be what Congress intended. Nothing in &#x00A7; 7114, &#x00A7; 7106 or in the legislative history of either suggest that disclosure of any of the data sought here is "prohibited by law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It may well be that the management rights section relied on by the Authority does render the documents sought nondisclosable under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) as the agencies argued at the administrative level. It may be that the documents are not disclosable under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) as the agencies also argued. However, as to these subjects, we express no opinion. The FLRA did not base its decision on those arguments, and we cannot affirm an agency on a basis which the agency did not consider....</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand, FLRA sent the <span class="Italic">NLRB Union</span> and the companion <span class="Italic">Park Police</span> cases back to the regional director for development of the record. <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union Local 6</span>, 32 FLRA 305, 307 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv., Nat'l Capital Region and Police Ass'n of Dist. of Columbia</span>, 32 FLRA 308, 310 (1988).

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Union is entitled to information which enables it to realistically assess the strengths or weaknesses of the employee's position....&#8197;There is no requirement that information requested under section 7114(b)(4)...actually be used in a grievance, however. The union may decide not to file a grievance after it obtains and evaluates the information. Moreover, an agency's contention that the union is aware of the information contained in a requested document does not relieve an agency of its obligation to furnish the requested document....&#8197;Further, an agency's contention that it did not rely on requested information as a basis for its action does not relieve an agency of its obligation to furnish the requested information....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Union requested a copy of the Regional Director's recommendation concerning the employee's request for part-time employment in order to evaluate the merits of a prospective grievance. The Judge noted that there were allegations that the Regional Director was hostile towards part-time schedules for attorneys. The Judge further noted that, in making decisions on matters which affect a regional office, the Respondent's Washington D.C. office relies on and utilizes the report and recommendation of the Regional Director. The Judge concluded that the Regional Director's memorandum was necessary for the Union to determine whether other considerations, which were not included in the Respondent's written decision to the employee, may have influenced the decision. In these circumstances, we conclude that the Regional Director's recommendation was necessary for the Union to fully know and understand the basis underlying the Respondent's position on the employee's request and to determine the most appropriate course of action to take in the matter....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority further stated that section 7114(b)(4)(C):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">does not exempt from disclosure guidance, advice, or counsel to management officials concerning the conditions of employment of a bargaining unit employee, for example: the personnel, policies and practices and other matters affecting the employee's working conditions that are not specifically related to the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing interpretation of section 7114(b)(4)(C) to the facts and circumstances in this case, we conclude that the disputed recommendations, concurrences, and opinions of managers and supervisors do not constitute guidance, advice, or counsel relating to "collective bargaining" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. In so doing, we reject the Judge's conclusion that the requested documents related to collective bargaining because they concerned discipline and sick leave and involved actual or potential grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the recommendations, concurrences and opinions of the managers and supervisors were not made in a context where the Respondent and the Union were engaged in actual bargaining. Moreover, the disputed documents were not guidance, advice, or counsel to management concerning the processing of the four grievances. Rather, the recommendations of the managers and supervisors were made prior to the filing of the grievances, when management was considering whether to take disciplinary action against two bargaining unit employees and whether to grant or deny the sick leave requests of two other bargaining unit employees. Therefore, we conclude that the recommendations, concurrences, and opinions of the managers and supervisors, withheld by the Respondent, do not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management relating to collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find, contrary to the Judge, that the requested documents were necessary for the Union to process the employees' grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute the exclusive representative is entitled to information that is necessary to enable it to carry out effectively its representational responsibilities, including information which will assist it in the investigation, evaluation, and processing of a grievance....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union requested the Respondent to provide it with all information pertaining to the disciplinary actions and sick leave requests of the grievants.

<p class="noindent">FLRA again considered the disclosure of internal disciplinary documentation in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 38 FLRA 965, 971-72 (1990) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

A "concurrence sheet" for proposed discipline was at issue. The concurrence sheet and the disciplinary file were circulated by management through various offices, including personnel and agency counsel (the Authority noted that the particular document did not contain comments of counsel), for their comments and signatures. Comments of the respondents were significant in the determination of whether discipline would be imposed and, if so, with what severity. FLRA determined that the concurrence sheet should have been provided to the union that requested it during the processing of a grievance. The document did not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials relating to collective bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the Respondent circulated a draft of a proposed disciplinary action to be taken against a unit employee, covered by a coordination sheet, which designated supervisors and management officials for review, comments, and concurrence. All the designated officials signed the coordination sheet without comment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board</span>, 38 FLRA No. 48, slip op. at 17-18 (1990) (<span class="Italic">NLRB</span>), the Authority held that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">section 7114(b)(4)(C) exempts from disclosure to the exclusive representative information which contains guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management officials relating specifically to the collective bargaining process, such as: (1) courses of action agency management should take in negotiations with the union; (2) how a provision of the collective bargaining agreement should be interpreted and applied; (3) how a grievance or an unfair labor practice charge should be handled; and (4) other labor-management interactions which have an impact on the union's status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority further stated that section 7114(b)(4)(C)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">does not exempt from disclosure guidance, advice, or counsel to management officials concerning the conditions of employment of a bargaining unit employee, for example: the personnel, policies and practices and other matters affecting the employee's working conditions that are not specifically related to the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing interpretation of section 7114(b)(4)(C) to the facts and circumstances in this case, we conclude that the discipline coordination sheet does not constitute guidance, advice, or counsel relating to "collective bargaining" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. In so concluding, we specifically reject the Judge's statements which imply that the discipline coordination sheet would be exempt from disclosure under section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute if it contained comments or statements of managers and supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the coordination sheet sought by the Union pertains to a disciplinary action taken against a bargaining unit employee. The concurrences of the management officials and supervisors were not made in a context where the Agency and the Union were engaged in actual bargaining. Moreover, the concurrences of the supervisors and management officials do not pertain to the processing of the employee's grievance or to an unfair labor practice charge. Consistent with <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, therefore, we conclude that the requested discipline coordination sheet does not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management relating to collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once again into the breach, FLRA decided that supervisory recommendations concerning a proposed adverse action were subject to statutory disclosure. FLRA provided additional analysis of the interplay of FOIA and &#x00A7; 7114, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 40 FLRA 1070, 1080-82 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute limits an agency's duty to furnish data "to the extent not prohibited by law[.]" In order for the "prohibited by law" provision of section 7114(b)(4) to apply, "there must be something somewhere in the law that forbids that data's disclosure." <span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 6</span>, 842 F.2d at 486.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FOIA Exemption 5 provides that the FOIA does not apply to matters that are:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]nter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have interpreted Exemption 5 as incorporating the governmental deliberative process privilege, which protects advice, recommendations, and opinions that are part of the deliberative, consultative, decision-making process of government. <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Sears, Roebuck and Company</span>, 421 U.S. 132, 150-154 (1975); <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink</span>, 410 U.S. 73, 85-91 (1973).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that neither FOIA Exemption 5 nor the privilege it incorporates prohibits the disclosure of the requested documents.&#x2003;The Authority has previously determined that the FOIA does not prohibit release of data; rather, it permits agencies to invoke certain exceptions to withhold data falling within those exceptions. <span class="Italic">Department of the Army Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina</span>, 26 FLRA 407, 412-13 (1987). Thus, neither FOIA Exemption 5 nor the governmental deliberative process privilege it incorporates prohibits <span id="Page_351"></span>by law the disclosure of the documents in this case under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that FOIA Exemption 5 and the governmental deliberative process privilege are applicable to section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, we conclude that statutory provision and the privilege it incorporates do not forbid the release of documents in the circumstances of this case. Thus, in our view, FOIA Exemption 5 does not forbid the disclosure of data, as in this case, that was part of a deliberative process in an agency personnel decision. Rather, based on a review of court decisions, we conclude that FOIA Exemption 5 is intended to apply only to data that was part of the deliberative process in the formulation of agency policy. In this regard, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Coastal States Gas Corp.</span> that FOIA Exemption 5 and the governmental deliberative process privilege protect against premature disclosure of proposed "policies before they have been finally formulated[.]" 617 F.2d at 866. Further, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Sears</span> stated, with respect to FOIA Exemption 5, that "frank discussion of legal or policy matters in writing might be inhibited if the discussion were made public, and that the decisions and policies formulated would be the poorer as a result." 421 U.S. at 150 (citation omitted)....&#8197;The clear tenor of these cases is that the privilege protects documents prepared in the formulation of policy on behalf of an agency and not the type of personnel action at issue herein.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Respondent that <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> support the conclusion that FOIA Exemption 5 and the governmental deliberative process privilege apply to documents that were part of the deliberative process in an agency personnel decision. Admittedly, in footnote 6 of <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, the court states, without explanation, "that [FOIA] Exemption 5 protects the "deliberative process" involved "in making personnel decisions[.]" 632 F. Supp. at 1277 n.6. In support of this statement, the court cites to <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>. The documents barred from disclosure in <span class="Italic">Ryan</span>, however, were characterized by the court as part of the deliberative process in the formulation of policy regarding the Attorney General's evaluation of selection processes for Federal district court judges. 617 F.2d at 791. They did not concern individual agency personnel matters. Similarly, although not expressly characterized as such by the court, the SF-52s, the documents barred from disclosure in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, were intertwined with the Agency's policy-making process. Thus, the Court describes the SF-52s in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By analogy the Population Division's decision in the instant case to initiate the personnel process by an SF-52 requesting that a position be filled is, in essence, a decision to make more decisions with respect to such essential matters as whether the position is needed at all, at what cost and from whose budget, what the successful applicant will be expected to do, and to whom he or she will report, as well as who should be chosen to fill it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">632 F.&#x2003;Supp. at 1277. In contrast, the documents at issue in this case concern only one personnel action regarding one employee that has no reasonably foreseeable effect on the overall policy direction of the Agency. Therefore, we find that <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> and <span class="Italic">Ryan</span> do not support the conclusion that FOIA Exemption 5 and the governmental deliberative process privilege protect from disclosure documents written to assist an agency in making individual personnel decisions. Accordingly, we conclude that the documents sought in this case are not prohibited by law from disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU, supra</span>, rejected management's contention that the recommendations were exempt from disclosure because they constituted collective bargaining guidance, advice, or counsel, 40 FLRA at 1085:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e conclude that the disputed documents do not constitute guidance, advice, or counsel relating to collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute. In so doing, we reject the Respondent's claim that the requested documents fall within the ambit of section 7114(b)(4)(c) because they "reflect assessment of the incidents, deliberations or thought processes, and recommendations concerning appropriate management action."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record reveals that the requested documents created by Respondent contains facts, supervisors' assessments and a discussion of some of the mitigating factors sought by the Union....&#8197;These assessments and discussions were not made in a context involving any type of negotiations between the parties. Moreover, the assessments and discussions of supervisors were made prior to the filing of a grievance, when management was considering disciplinary action against an employee. Therefore, the disputed documents could not be considered guidance, advice, or counsel to management concerning the processing of a grievance. Rather, they involved a typical personnel matter affecting an individual employee's working conditions, a matter specifically not exempted from disclosure in NLRB. Accordingly, we conclude that the requested documents do not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management relating to collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union was to demonstrate that information concerning recommendations as to penalties is "necessary" before disclosure is compelled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 10</span>, 32 FLRA 237, 240 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reentered the information exchange on the subject of "necessity" in early 1992 with its decision involving the <span class="Italic">Park Service</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, and <span class="Italic">Local 6, NLRB Union</span> cases, conveniently consolidated under <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523, 525-34 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The court accepted FLRA's basic approaches but required FLRA to engage in a particularized need analysis of "necessity" for the information. The cases were returned to FLRA with an opinion written for the court by Judge Edwards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In all three cases before the court, the unions sought to compel agency management officials to disclose information pertaining to employee grievances. For example, the unions requested documents embodying recommendations that subordinate agency officials had provided their superiors regarding possible actions to be taken against agency employees. The agencies refused to provide the requested information, and unfair labor practice proceedings ensued. The agencies claimed that, because the documents included information on "guidance, advice, counsel, or training" for management, they need not be disclosed under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). The FLRA, however, construed &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) to exempt only "guidance, advice, counsel, or training" relating to the <span class="Italic">process</span> of collective bargaining. Because the Authority found that the requested documents did not fall within the prescribed category, the agencies were ordered to "cease and desist" from nondisclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We uphold the FLRA's construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). In suggesting that the subsection exempts <span class="Italic">all</span> information relating to guidance, advice, counsel or training, petitioners render meaningless the phrase "relating to collective bargaining" in &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). The plain terms of the statute indicate that Congress did not intend a blanket exemption for all such information. Even if the statute is arguably ambiguous, however, the FLRA's interpretation is reasonable and thus entitled to deference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials that is not covered by the FLRA's construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) must be disclosed under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) <span class="Italic">if</span> the information is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining." However, in construing subsection (b)(4)(B), the FLRA erred in failing to recognize that "necessary" is not the same as "relevant." Agencies have an important interest in deliberating over employee actions; thus, this interest cannot be ignored in the application of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). In any case in which information is sought under subsection (b)(4)(B), there must be a particularized showing of need for information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" provided for management officials if such information is not otherwise exempt under subsection (b)(4)(C). Because the FLRA failed to give full consideration to the limiting language of subsection (b)(4)(B), we remand for further consideration of this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I. &#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The instant petition consolidates three different cases in which the agencies took action against particular employees, and the union requested information about the employees for pending or prospective grievance procedures. In each case, the agency asserted that the information sought was exempt from disclosure as "guidance," "advice" or "counsel," because it concerned a supervisor's recommendation of action, rather than the agency's final decision. The FLRA ordered disclosure, and the agencies then petitioned for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 6 Case</span>, <span class="Italic">No. 91-1044</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the National Labor Relations Board ("Local 6") case, a lawyer employed by the NLRB asked for a part-time work schedule. Her Regional Director wrote a memorandum to the Board's Assistant and Associate General Counsels, discussing the issue and providing his recommendation. The Assistant General Counsel wrote back to deny part-time employment, and this letter was released to the employee. The union filed a grievance over the denial. Before filing, and again during the grievance procedure, the union requested the Regional Director's memorandum. The NLRB refused, and an unfair labor practice proceeding ensued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA initially decided that disclosure was "prohibited by law" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). The Authority viewed the applicable "law" to be the "management rights" provision under section 7106 of the FSLMRS. This decision was vacated and remanded in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 6 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 483 (D.C. Cir. 1988), in which the court held that "[s]ection 7106 by any reading does not prohibit the disclosure of anything."...&#8197;The court left open the question of the significance of sections 7114(b)(4)(B) and (C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the FLRA returned the case to an administrative law judge ("ALJ"). The ALJ found that the Regional Director's memorandum was "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining," under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). He reasoned:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">While certain factors considered by the Regional Director were made known to the employee, the Union has no way of knowing whether <span id="Page_352"></span>other considerations may have influenced his recommendation and were included in his memorandum to Washington. The record reflects that other staff employees had worked part-time, and a claim was made that [the Regional Director] evinced hostility toward part-time employment by the legal profession. A contention that a unit employee was not permitted to engage in such employment, while others were granted such option, would make necessary the divulgence [of] the Director's recommendation to permit the Union to evaluate management's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 6</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 527, 534 (1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On review by the FLRA, the Authority agreed "that the Regional Director's recommendation was necessary for the Union to fully know and understand the basis underlying the Respondent's position on the employee's request and to determine the most appropriate course of action to take in the matter." <span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 6</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 506, 517 (1990) ("Local 6"). The Authority also held that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) was not coextensive with &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the FLRA reasoned that "collective bargaining means the <span class="Italic">process</span> wherein the agency and the exclusive representative are engaged in the performance of their mutual obligation to bargain," including contract negotiation and administration. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 519. Thus, "section 7114(b)(4)(C) exempts from disclosure to the exclusive representative 'guidance, advice, counsel or training for management officials relating to' the collective bargaining process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 520. Paradigmatically, the FLRA ruled, exempted texts were those including information on:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;courses of action agency management should take in negotiations with the union; (2) how a provision of the collective bargaining agreement should be interpreted and applied; (3) how a grievance or an unfair labor practice charge should be handled; and (4) other labor-management interactions which have an impact on the union's status as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 522-23. Under this view, the FLRA found that the entire memorandum authored by the Regional Director must be furnished to the union, because the "recommendation was not guidance, advice, or counsel to management concerning the handling of a grievance or unfair labor practice charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 523.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NLRB did not dispute that the memorandum was "normally maintained by the agency in the regular course of business," under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(A), or "reasonably available" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). Nor did the agency contend that disclosing the memorandum was "prohibited by law." Thus, the FLRA ordered disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">National Park Service Case</span>, <span class="Italic">No. 91-1087</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Park Service case involves four different United States Park Police employees.&#x2003;Two were denied sick leave; two were disciplined. The union filed grievances and requested information, including various intra-agency recommendations that Park Service officials provided, apparently as part of the established agency process for disciplinary actions and sick leaves. The requests were refused.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA initially decided that the Park Service had not committed an unfair labor practice, because disclosure was "prohibited by law" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106 (1988), the "management rights" provision. This court vacated and remanded, in the same decision that remanded the Local 6 case. <span class="Italic">NLRB Union, Local 6 v. FLRA</span>, 842 F.2d 483 (D.C. Cir. 1988). As with that case, the FLRA further remanded to an administrative law judge. This time, however, the ALJ decided that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) did not cover the requested information:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">If management takes, or proposes to take, any action against a bargaining unit employee..., the Union...only needs to know what action is going to be taken together with the factual basis and rationale for the decision....&#8197;Knowledge as to which lower level supervisor recommended or concurred in any action is neither necessary nor relevant to the full understanding and discussion of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Police Ass'n of the District of Columbia</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1041, 1054 (1989). The ALJ also found the information to be exempt under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1050-53. The FLRA reversed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority first applied the interpretation of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) formulated in <span class="Italic">Local 6</span>. "[T]he disputed documents were not guidance, advice, or counsel to management concerning the processing of the four grievances." <span class="Italic">Police Ass'n. of the District of Columbia</span>, 38 FLRA 1027, 1036 (1990). The FLRA then decided that the duty to disclose <span class="Italic">did</span> apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Union is entitled to information which will enable it to realistically assess the strengths or weaknesses of the employee's position. In the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the recommendations and comments of the managers and supervisors were necessary for the Union to: (1) fully understand the basis underlying the [Park Service's] decision on the matter; (2) realistically assess and evaluate the merits of the employee's grievance; and (3) determine the most appropriate course of action to take in the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1037 (citation omitted). As in the <span class="Italic">Local 6</span> case, the FLRA then ordered disclosure, because the information was conceded to be "normally maintained" and "reasonably available," and its disclosure legally permitted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Air Force Case</span>, <span class="Italic">No. 91-1070</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force case has a simpler procedural history.&#x2003;The Air Force reprimanded an employee, who grieved this discipline. In preparing for arbitration, the union requested the employee's "discipline coordination sheet." The Air Force has an established process for disciplinary decisions: at an interim stage in the disciplinary process, a coordination sheet is circulated to various officials, who register their concurrence or dissent. The union sought to learn whether the same official who made the disciplinary decision had earlier concurred, by signing the coordination sheet.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An administrative law judge found that the Air Force's refusal to release that document was an unfair labor practice. The gravamen of the employee's grievance was that the deciding official "had allegedly already approved the decision to discipline [the employee] and therefore the proceedings were not fair." <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1857</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 978, 980 (1989). "This document would have assisted [the union] in determining, and then arguing in a grievance and arbitration, that [the official] had been involved in processing and approving the proposed discipline and therefore, arguably, was not an appropriate official" to make the final decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 983. The ALJ also found that the discipline coordination sheet was not protected by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C), because it contained no "guidance, advice or counsel." The officials had simply registered their approval on the sheet, rather than providing any comments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA affirmed.&#x2003;As to "necessity," the Authority found that "[t]he coordination sheet identifies Agency officials who reviewed and approved the [Air Force's] proposed decision to reprimand the employee. Moreover, as found by the [ALJ], the officials who sign the coordination sheet can significantly affect the proposed discipline." <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1857</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 965, 971 (1990) ("<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>"). The Authority disagreed with the ALJ that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) would have protected the document if the signatories had provided comments. Rather, according to the FLRA, their concurrences "do not pertain to the processing of the employee's grievance or to an unfair labor practice charge." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 972. Therefore, it was held that the discipline coordination sheet should have been released under the <span class="Italic">Local 6</span> standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force also claimed that the Privacy Act and other statutes protected this document.&#x2003;Both the ALJ and the FLRA rejected this claim. Since "normal maintenance" and "reasonable availability" were conceded, the Authority ordered disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The three agencies petition this court to vacate the disclosure orders in <span class="Italic">Local 6</span>, <span class="Italic">Park Service</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>. They argue that some or all of the requested information was exempt under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) and, if not, "unnecessary" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Introduction</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties present conflicting analogies to this court.&#x2003;Petitioners argue that a disclosure request under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) is like a demand for government information under the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"): the government, as policymaker or employer, has the same interest in keeping secret its deliberations. By contrast, intervenors (the unions) compare the agencies to private-sector firms: the deliberative-process privilege should not cover the government <span class="Italic">qua</span> employer. We reject these analogies, and rest our decision on the language and structure of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not understand &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) to incorporate a FOIA-like exemption for any predecisional, deliberative document. Nor do we agree that any such document is readily discoverable, unless covered by the FLRA's narrow construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). Rather, the correct interpretation of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) is intermediate between these two extremes. "Guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials that concerns the process of collective bargaining is unavailable to the union; other such "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" is available when "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Petitioners urge a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule exempting all "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training." The FSLMRS does not compel such a rule, nor has the FLRA unreasonably failed to promulgate one. Indeed, the FLRA reasonably concluded that a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) would be overbroad. However, the FLRA's construction of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) is flawed to the extent that the Authority views the subsection to cover both "necessary" and "relevant" information. This view is clearly <span id="Page_353"></span>incorrect with respect to information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials. The FSLMRS makes only "necessary" documents available to the union, not merely "relevant" ones. Where the information sought pertains to "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials, "necessity" means that there must be a particularized need in order to justify disclosure under subsection (b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Section 7114(b)(4)(C)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the agencies' position in this case, we uphold the Authority's judgment that the exemption for "guidance," "advice," "counsel," or "training" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) <span class="Italic">cannot</span> have the same breadth as the duty to furnish under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). Subsection (b)(4)(B) speaks of information "necessary for...negotiation of subjects within the scope of" collective bargaining; subsection (b)(4)(C) refers to information "relating to" collective bargaining. The clear terms of the statute indicate that subsections (b)(4)(B) and (C) are not coextensive with respect to information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials. Thus, Congress cannot have intended a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule exempting <span class="Italic">all</span> such information from disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). To hold otherwise would be to render meaningless the words "relating to" in subsection (b)(4)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA made sense of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) by construing "relating to collective bargaining" in this context to refer to the "process" thereof. "Relating to" is an ambiguous term, and the structure of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) only makes clear that "relating to" cannot be synonymous with "necessary for...negotiation of subjects within the scope of." In other words, the FLRA's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) lies within the zone of ambiguity....&#8197;Here, the issue is "reasonableness"; and surely the FLRA <span class="Italic">has</span> made a reasonable interpretive decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"There is no evidence...that [FSLMRS] departed from the basic assumption underlying collective bargaining in both the public and the private sector that the parties proceed from contrary and to an extent antagonistic viewpoints and concepts of self-interest." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 107-08, 104 S. Ct. 439, 449, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983) (internal quotation omitted). Moreover, these "antagonistic" parties are engaged in a process of "bargaining" or "negotiation." Each presents a self-interested demand or proposal, which the other evaluates from its own point of view. Necessarily, the bargainers are not obliged to reveal their <span class="Italic">strategies</span>: the planned sequences of demands and proposals. For if the parties <span class="Italic">do</span> have full strategic information, then the process of offer and counteroffer becomes superfluous, and the bargaining process is transformed into something else entirely....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Yet, surely <span class="Italic">some</span> information must be shared. Where one side has false beliefs about a mandatory subject of bargaining, the other may profit, but this hardly advances the common good. "In passing the [FSLMRS], Congress unquestionably intended...to make the collective-bargaining process a more effective instrument of the public interest...." <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 464 U.S. at 107, 104 S. Ct. at 449. That "public interest" is misserved where unions agree to "conditions of employment" they misunderstand; or where they mistakenly concede that agreed-upon conditions are satisfied. An uninformed union "would be unable to properly perform its duties specified in the collective bargaining agreement and no meaningful bargaining could take place." <span class="Italic">San Diego Newspaper Guild v. NLRB</span>, 548 F.2d 863, 866-67 (9th Cir. 1977). At best, the unions and agencies should be commonly and truly informed about <span class="Italic">what</span> they are demanding and proposing, during contract negotiation or administration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C), the FLRA has adopted just this distinction between nonstrategic and strategic information: in bargaining versus information about the bargaining itself. An agency's deliberation about the collective bargaining process is, precisely, its strategy. Thus, the Authority's construction of the statute--that section 7114(b)(4)(C) exempts from disclosure to the union information on "guidance, advice, counsel, or training" for management officials relating to the collective bargaining process--is wholly reasonable and prompts our deference.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7114(b)(4)(B)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Factor of "Necessity"</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The collective bargaining process arguably is optimized if unions and agencies have all relevant information about the subjects of collective bargaining.&#x2003;But this does not mean that agencies should or must disclose all such information. In the private sector, "[a]bsent special circumstances, 'relevance' is determinative of the duty to disclose," <span class="Italic">Soule Glass &#x0026; Glazing Co. v. NLRB</span>, 652 F.2d 1055, 1092 (1st Cir. 1981) (citation omitted); but "union interests in arguably relevant information [do not] always predominate over all other interests," <span class="Italic">Detroit Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 440 U.S. 301, 318, 99 S. Ct. 1123, 1132, 59 L. Ed.2d 333 (1979). Similarly, the FSLMRS does not aim to optimize collective bargaining in compelling disclosure of all relevant information. Rather, "efficient government" remains an independent and, to some extent, conflicting purpose of the statute. Thus, section 7114(b)(4)(B) makes clear that agency disclosure must be tailored to multiple purposes. The provision entitles the union to "necessary," not to "relevant" information, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, something less than what full "discovery" might require.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, "necessity [under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B)] is a matter of degree."...&#8197;A statute that requires "necessity" implicitly recognizes countervailing interests, because a "need," by definition, is an interest of particular strength and urgency. If only pro-disclosure interests were material to &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B), the statutory factor of "necessity" would be surplusage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In weighing the employer's duty to furnish information under subsection (b)(4)(B), the requisite strength of the union's "need" will depend on the intensity of countervailing interests. "In some instances, the concepts of relevancy and necessity may, indeed, merge indistinguishably; whereas in others, they may remain distinct." <span class="Italic">Local 13, Detroit Newspaper Printing &#x0026; Graphic Communications Union v. NLRB</span>, 598 F.2d 267, 272 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (discussing private-sector disclosure). For example, in <span class="Italic">North Germany Area Council, Overseas Educ. Assn v. FLRA</span>, 805 F.2d 1044, 1048 (D.C. Cir. 1986), we spoke of the Statute's "liberal standard for assessing the relevancy of the requested information"; in that case there was no anti-disclosure interest. In a case of this sort, however, involving information on "guidance," "advice,"...provided for management officials, we know that there is some countervailing anti-disclosure interest because of the existence of subsection (b)(4)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although, as we have already held, subsections (b)(4)(B) and (C) are not coterminous in their reach, the latter provision nonetheless suggests that, because collective bargaining presupposes that "the parties proceed from contrary and to an extent antagonistic viewpoints and concepts of self-interest,"...management often has a legitimate interest in preserving for itself, alone, information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" provided for management officials. This interest is most weighty with respect to matters relating to the <span class="Italic">process</span> of collective bargaining, which explains the categorical exemption found in &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C); but the interest also exists, albeit to a lesser degree, in connection with all such information pertaining to subjects within the scope of collective bargaining....&#8197;Thus, the employer's interest in protecting the sanctity of information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials must be weighed against a union claim of necessity under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the foregoing considerations, we hold that "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials that is claimed to be necessary for the "full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining" should be released upon union request only in those circumstances when the union has a particularized need for the information.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. &#x2003;<span class="Italic">Particularized Need</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Petitioners contend that &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) should be interpreted to incorporate a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials always is "unnecessary" for the full and proper discussion, understanding and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining. This is a wholly specious claim, and we reject it. The FLRA has chosen to adjudicate the disclosure of such information on a case-by-case basis, and we defer to that choice....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The words "relating to collective bargaining" in subsection (b)(4)(C) would be surplusage if, as petitioners suggest, Congress' intent was to exempt <span class="Italic">all</span> predecisional deliberation from union discovery. Even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that unions often will be unable to show a particularized need for such information, there always will be some exceptions. Case-by-case adjudication cures the overbreadth, and petitioners fail to show that the cure is not worth the cost. Thus, the FLRA was fully justified in adopting an approach which considers the application of subsection (b)(4)(B) on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, although the FLRA seemingly erred in failing to fully weigh the factor of "necessity," the Authority was nonetheless correct in suggesting that there are cases in which unions will be able to demonstrate a particularized need for certain categories of predecisional deliberation. Specifically, where "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" concerns agency action against a particular employee, and the information is requested in connection with a grievance over that action, the union may well meet the particularized-need standard <span class="Italic">where the union has a grievable complaint covering the information</span>. A statute or the contract may impose a duty on the agency regarding predecisional deliberation, and the duty may then ground a grievable claim of right in the employee or union. If so, disclosure normally should obtain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, a collective bargaining agreement may establish an agency procedure for employee action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7106(b) (1988) ("[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating...procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising any authority under this section"). The agreed-upon procedure might be multi-level, pursuant to which subordinate officials might be required to make interim recommendations before a final decision issues. Such recommendations arguably <span class="Italic">could</span> fall outside the category of "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training." But even if <span id="Page_354"></span>they are not so characterized, the recommendations should normally be disclosed to the union, assuming the union could grieve the agency's failure to follow the procedure. In such a case, the union would have a particularized need to know whether the agency has complied with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Another instance in which "guidance," advice," "counsel" or "training" for management might be disclosable under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) is when the disputed document creates a grievable action. A subordinate supervisor might counsel or warn an employee about allegedly poor work performance and then place a confirming written evaluation in the employee's personnel file. If the parties' agreement or existing practices make it clear that such evaluations are used to determine subsequent disciplinary action by superior management officials (pursuant to a scheme of "corrective" or "progressive" discipline), the employee surely would have a strong and valid claim to disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B). The union would need the information to determine whether the employee must be protected against the accumulation of negative evaluations in his or her personnel file (that ultimately may lead to disciplinary action), or to determine whether disciplinary action that has been taken is justified by the employee's record. As we noted in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1986),</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Union can hardly be expected to understand, evaluate or discuss management policies regarding employee discipline if management is unwilling to explain to the Union the circumstances surrounding the discharge of bargaining unit personnel. Moreover, the Union is properly concerned with its own status as the bargaining representative, which requires it to have access to information necessary to assess its responsibilities. In short, information concerning the dismissal of unit employees is clearly "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects with[in] the scope of collective bargaining" under [&#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B)] of the Labor Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1361.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conversely, where the union has no grievable complaint covering information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training," &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) normally will not require disclosure. If the union simply wants background information underlying some later decision, and the grievance only concerns <span class="Italic">objective</span> constraints on agency action, then the predecisional text is probably "unnecessary"--indeed, it also may be irrelevant. Whatever the <span class="Italic">history</span> of the justification asserted in the decisional document--whatever the agency's "real reason"--the union need not look beyond the four corners of that document, because only the objective <span class="Italic">truth</span> of the justification is at issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we uphold the FLRA in adjudicating the disclosure of information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel," or "training" on a case-by-case basis, where such information is not exempted by &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C). At least where the union has a grievable complaint covering the predecisional text, the union may have a particularized need for disclosure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Instant Cases</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant cases, the FLRA has required disclosure without explaining the "necessity" of the requested information. Thus, we remand for adjudication under the particularized-need standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In each of the cases, it appears, the predecisional document or documents were formulated as part of an established agency process for employee action. If the employee or union has a grievable right to the process, specifically to the requested pre-decision, then disclosure should obtain. However, neither the administrative law judges in <span class="Italic">Local 6</span> and <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, nor the FLRA in affirming the judges' disclosure orders and reversing the decision of the <span class="Italic">Park Service</span> judge against disclosure, found that the requested recommendations were required by the parties' bargaining agreement or their established practices. The issue was not addressed. Nor do we know whether the documents were placed in the employees' personnel files.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, in <span class="Italic">Local 6</span>, the FLRA provided an utterly conclusory argument for disclosure: "the Regional Director's recommendation was necessary for the Union to fully know and understand the basis underlying the [NLRB's] position." 38 F.L.R.A. at 517. This ground does not satisfy the applicable standard of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, the administrative law judge reasoned that the discipline coordination sheet was relevant to the union's recusal argument (that the disciplining official ought not have participated in earlier deliberations). However, the ALJ did not find that the union or employee had a colorable claim to such recusal, or that the union needed the document instead of the official's testimony at arbitration. In affirming, the FLRA merely observed that "the officials who sign the coordination sheet can significantly affect the proposed discipline." 38 F.L.R.A. at 971. This is inadequate to assess a request for disclosure under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B) with respect to information on "guidance," "advice," "counsel" or "training" for management officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">Park Service</span>, the administrative law judge found disclosure unnecessary. He reasoned that the predecisional document is irrelevant if the material constraints on agency action are objective, and the union has no grievable complaint covering the document. The FLRA reversed, for the same conclusory reasons that were furnished in <span class="Italic">Local 6</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the FLRA need not reconsider its decision that the information in the requested documents was outside the &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C) exemption: we uphold the Authority's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(C), and petitioners concede that the interpretation was rightly applied. Rather, the FLRA must decide whether some or all of that information is "necessary" under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA remanded <span class="Italic">Park Police</span> to its ALJ for findings on particularized need.
<span class="Italic">See</span> 44 FLRA 1537, 1539 (1992). The ALJ
issued his recommended decision following remand, exceptions were
filed, and FLRA concluded that a particularized need was demonstrated. The employer was required to produce the supervisory memoranda, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv., Nat'l Capital Region, Park Police and Police Ass'n of Dist. of Columbia</span>, 48 FLRA 1151, 1160-64 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the court's decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> and conclude that an agency is not obligated to provide a union with requested documents containing advice, guidance, counsel, or training materials provided for management officials under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute unless the union demonstrates a particularized need, as discussed by the court, for such information. Previous inconsistent Authority decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disciplinary Recommendations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(b)(4)(B) of the Statute requires an agency to furnish a union, upon request, with information which, as relevant here, is "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining[.]" In <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the court held that the Respondent could not be found in violation of the Statute for failing to furnish the Union with the requested recommendations unless the Union demonstrated a particularized need for the information. That is, the court held that, insofar as requested information encompasses advice, guidance, counsel, or training provided for management officials, a conclusion that such information is necessary under section 7114(b)(4) requires a finding that the requesting union has shown a particularized need for it.[8] Although the court offered two examples of ways in which the Union could demonstrate such particularized need, the court also stated that documents that are "strictly 'intramanagement' normally will not be discoverable under [section] 7114(b)(4)(B)." 952 F.2d at 533 n.6.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Judge stated that "'particularized need'" is a "need greater than merely 'necessary' within the meaning of [section] 7114(b)(4)(B)." Insofar as this statement indicates that a finding of particularized need differs from a finding of necessity under the Statute, we disagree. In our view, the court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> held that, with respect to advice, guidance, counsel, and training provided for management officials, a finding of particularized need constitutes a finding of necessity under the Statute. In this vein, we also reject the Judge's conclusion that, although the Union did not demonstrate a "[g]eneral particularized need" for the requested information...the Union did show "particularized need" based on the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, in agreement with the Judge, that the Union demonstrated a particularized need for the requested disciplinary recommendations. We note that, pursuant to procedures instituted by the Chief of the U.S. Park Police, supervisors are required to make such recommendations. It is not clear to us that, as stated by the court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, "the union could grieve the agency's failure to follow the procedure." 952 F.2d at 533. However, we conclude that Article XVI, Section 6, of the parties' agreement requires the Respondent to disclose the recommendations to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, it is undisputed that the requested disciplinary recommendations were placed in affected employees' complaint files. Nothing in the record before us provides a reasonable basis on which to conclude that such recommendations do not constitute either "records" or "documentation," within the meaning of Article XVI, Section 6, which, as set forth previously, provides that affected employees and their Union representatives may "review and receive...one copy of the records and documentation pertaining to the complaint...." We reject the Respondent's assertion that "[d]isciplinary recommendations could not possibly constitute 'documentation pertaining to the complaint' since they are given after the complaint is documented...and assigned a disposition, such as 'sustained.'" Whether they are developed before or after a complaint is documented, it is clear that recommendations regarding disciplinary action pertain to the complaint and, in this case, the disputed recommendations were, in fact, placed in the affected employees' complaint files. Moreover, the Judge clearly interpreted Article XVI, Section 6, as requiring the disclosure of the disputed recommendations and we have no basis on which to reject his interpretation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_355"></span>Although, as noted previously, the court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> held that documents that are "strictly 'intramanagement' [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] normally will not be discoverable" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, the court held also that such documents should "normally be disclosed" in situations where a union could grieve an agency's failure to follow agreed-upon procedures requiring such recommendations because the union "would have a particularized need to know whether the agency has complied with the collective bargaining agreement." 952 F.2d at 533 (footnote omitted). We conclude that, in Article XVI, Section 6, the Respondent agreed to provide the Union, as representative of affected employees, with copies of documents in those employees' complaint files. Thus, although that contractual provision may not govern the creation of documents in complaint files, it clearly constitutes a negotiated procedure applicable to maintenance and disclosure of them. There is no contention that the Union could not grieve an alleged violation of Article XVI, Section 6. As such, the Union has, in our view, a particularized need, under <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, for such documents, including portions containing supervisory recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Respondent was required by section 7114(b)(4) to supply the requested information to the Union and that its failure to do so violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute. We will direct the Respondent to cease and desist from its violation of the Statute and to supply the requested information to the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, Dallas and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 41 FLRA 137, 142 (1991), considered management's refusal to provide the union with several memoranda concerning "the policy of the Respondent's Regional Office governing disciplinary and adverse actions":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he memoranda withheld by the Respondent did not concern guidance, advice, or counsel to management officials or supervisors concerning the handling of a grievance or any other matter relating to the labor-management process. Rather, the memoranda contained guidelines for managers and supervisors as to the procedures governing disciplinary and adverse actions. That is, the memoranda contained Agency personnel policies affecting the conditions of employment of unit employees. We conclude, therefore, that the memoranda were not exempt from disclosure under section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol, Dallas</span> was remanded to FLRA's ALJ for further consideration in light of <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

Following remand, FLRA determined that the memoranda requested by the union constituted guidance that could only be obtained through a showing of particularized need for those documents.

<p class="noindent-1">It is the Judge's Decision on remand, wherein the Judge concluded that the Respondent violated the Statute by failing to provide the Union with the requested memoranda, which is now before the Authority pursuant to exceptions filed by the Respondent. The General Counsel filed an opposition to the Respondent's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its initial decision in this case, the Authority concluded that the Respondent violated the Statute by refusing to provide the Union with the requested memoranda. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, Dallas, Texas</span>, 41 FLRA 137 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Border Patrol I</span>). The Authority found that the memoranda did not constitute guidance, advice, counsel, or training provided for management officials or supervisors ("intramanagement guidance"), relating to collective bargaining within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4)(C), and that the requested information "was necessary for the Union to effectively represent the grievants" and "necessary for the Union to carry out its representational function." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 141.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the requested memoranda are not necessary, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. Therefore, we dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judge's Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts are set forth in the attached Judge's decision and are only briefly summarized here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In connection with the processing of grievances concerning the suspension of three employees, the Union requested, under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, three memoranda that related to the Respondent's policy governing disciplinary and adverse actions. In requesting the memoranda, the Union stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This material is considered relevant as there are several [a]dverse [a]ction cases awaiting [a]rbitration in which one of the issues raised was disparate treatment and it is hoped that the aforementioned material will aid us in clarifying and possibly resolving these issues prior to [a]rbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This material is considered necessary because, in order for the Union to provide adequate and meaningful representation to the bargaining unit members, it must be cognizant of the policies under which [m]anagement operates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent denied the Union's request on the basis that the information constituted guidance to management officials and supervisors that was exempt from disclosure under section 7114(b)(4)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge concluded that the requested memoranda were "necessary" within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. In response to the General Counsel's argument that the Union needed the memoranda to show that the Respondent had a stated policy of requiring management "to administer like punishment for like offenses" and was not complying with this policy, the Judge found that the Union representative who requested the memoranda "admitted [at the hearing] that he didn't need the memoranda to show disparate treatment" and "that he knew that the policy of like penalties for like offenses was...not in the [requested] memoranda...." Nonetheless, the Judge found that the Union established a "particularized need" for the requested information within the meaning of <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>) "because the data would have been <span class="Italic">useful</span> to the Union, first, in knowing the policies management operates under in disciplinary cases and second, to determine whether management has complied with its own policies as a failure to comply could indicate a procedural error." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20 (emphasis added). The Judge determined that the requested memoranda "would permit the Union to determine whether a case had been conducted in accordance with Respondent's prescribed procedures and would provide a basis for alleging procedural error[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21. The Judge found that the other requirements of section 7114(b)(4) were met and determined that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the requested memoranda are not necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, and that the Respondent's failure to furnish the memoranda to the Union did not violate the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, the Authority issued <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri</span>, 50 FLRA 661 (1995) (Member Talkin concurring) (<span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>), which set forth the analysis for determining whether information is "necessary" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. We held that a union making a request under that section must establish a particularized need for the requested information by articulating, with specificity, why it needs that information, including the uses to which the information will be put, and the connection between those uses and the union's representational responsibilities under the Statute. We also stated that a union's burden will not be satisfied merely by showing that requested information is or would be relevant or useful, but that the union must demonstrate that the information is "'required in order for the union adequately to represent its members.'" <span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670 (quoting <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 991 F.2d 285, 290 (5th Cir. 1993)). The union's responsibility for articulating and explaining its interests extends to more than a conclusory or bare assertion; among other things, the request for information must be sufficient to permit an agency to make a reasoned judgment as to whether the information must be disclosed under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the agency's responsibilities, where the requested information constitutes documents containing guidance, advice, counsel, or training for management officials ("intramanagement guidance"), the Authority has accepted the court's view, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d at 532, that an agency has presumptive anti-disclosure interests in such documents. <span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>, 50 FLRA at 670 (citing <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Park Service, National Capital Region, United States Park</span> <span class="Italic">Police</span>, 48 FLRA 1151, 1160 (1993) (Member Talkin concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">National Park Service</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the parties are unable to agree on whether, or to what extent, requested information must be provided, we will find an unfair labor practice if a union has established a particularized need for the information and either: (1) the agency has not established a countervailing interest; or (2) the agency has established such an interest but it does not outweigh the union's demonstration of particularized need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytic framework of <span class="Italic">IRS Kansas City</span>, we find that none of the three assertions of need advanced by the Union satisfies its burden of demonstrating that the information requested is required for it to adequately represent unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We focus first on the only specific reason asserted by the Union at the time of its request for the three memoranda: that it needed the information to assess whether the Respondent had disparately treated particular employees, as relevant to several adverse action cases awaiting arbitration. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the Union has not established the requisite connection between the three memoranda and this asserted need. In this regard, the Judge found <span id="Page_356"></span>that "the memoranda requested provide no basis to evaluate disparate treatment of grievants and the Union, on rehearing, conceded that it did not need the data to show disparate treatment...."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, in its opposition, the General Counsel does not dispute the Judge's finding on this point. Rather, the General Counsel argues that "the memoranda is [sic] the starting point for obtaining other information which could show disparate treatment." According to the General Counsel, if the Union learned from a review of the memoranda that management was required to maintain a file of disciplinary and adverse actions that was indexed by offense, the Union would request a copy of the entire file or at least those portions dealing with the same offense as that with which the three grievants had been charged. The General Counsel further asserts that if the file entries did not contain the amount of punishment imposed on the employee, the Union would request copies of the actual disciplinary/adverse actions named in the file. Additionally, the General Counsel contends that if the Respondent denied that it maintained such a file, the Union would grieve the Respondent's failure to comply with its own internal policy. In addition to being attenuated, this asserted trail to information needed to evaluate the disparate treatment concern ignores the Judge's finding, which is supported by the record, that the memoranda do not establish <span class="Italic">any</span> requirement but only guidance. Therefore, there is no persuasive connection between the Union's asserted specific need for the memoranda and its ability to demonstrate disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's second reason set forth at the time of its request--to "provide adequate and meaningful representation to the bargaining unit members"--is insufficient because it lacks specificity. It is possible to construe this reason as having been amplified during the course of the litigation to refer more specifically to the Union's need to determine whether the Respondent was complying with its policy of "like penalties for like offenses." Here again, however, the testimony of the Union representative demonstrates, as the Judge found, that the Union representative "knew that the policy of like penalties for like offenses was contained in [a Department of Justice Administrative Manual] and not in the memoranda...which he requested." Accordingly, the second reason asserted by the Union does not demonstrate a need for the requested memoranda.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only additional "need" asserted by the Union as a reason for requesting the three memoranda was one raised at the hearing; namely, to determine whether the Respondent had failed to comply with a policy and thereby committed "a procedural violation" of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Even assuming, without deciding, that this need was articulated in a timely fashion, the record does not establish any connection between the three memoranda and procedures managers were required to follow in disciplining employees because, as found previously, the memoranda do not establish any requirement for managers to follow when disciplining employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Union has failed to meet its burden of articulating with specificity the reasons for which it needed the requested memoranda and demonstrating that the information was required in order for the Union adequately to represent unit employees. That the requested information "would have been useful to the Union...in knowing the policies management operates under in disciplinary cases and...to determine whether management has complied with its own policies as a failure to comply could indicate a procedural error[,]" does not establish that the Union has satisfied its burden, because a showing of usefulness is insufficient to establish a particularized need. <span class="Italic">See, for example, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity</span> <span class="Italic">Commission</span>, 51 FLRA No. 26 (1995), slip op. at 11.</p>
