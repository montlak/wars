<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-100"><span class="space">2.</span> Collateral Estoppel</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel is generally considered to involve preclusion of issues previously litigated that surface in subsequent litigation between the same parties. For example, if parties litigate through a contract grievance proceeding the validity of a performance standard in an appeal from the denial of a within-grade increase, and the same parties are now before the Board examining the validity of the same performance standard in a subsequent performance-based removal action, a fair argument is made that collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of the validity of the performance standard in the Board removal appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit said of collateral estoppel, and its application to administrative agencies (and MSPB is one of those), <span class="Italic">Synqor, Inc. v. Vicor Corp</span>., 988 F.3d 1341, 1346-47 (Fed. Cir. 2021):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]he determination of a question directly involved in one action is conclusive as to that question in a second suit." <span class="Italic">B &#x0026; B Hardware, Inc. v. Hargis Indus., Inc</span>., 575 U.S. 138, 147 (2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Cromwell v. County of Sac</span>, 94 U.S. 351, 354 (1877)). "It is well established that collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, applies in the administrative context." <span class="Italic">MaxLinear, Inc</span>., 880 F.3d at 1376. In fact, "because the principle of issue preclusion was so 'well established' at common law, in those situations in which Congress has authorized agencies to resolve disputes, 'courts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with the expectation that the principle [of issue preclusion] will apply 'except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.'" <span class="Italic">B &#x0026; B Hardware</span>, 575 U.S. at 148 (quoting <span class="Italic">Astoria Fed. Sav. &#x0026; Loan Ass'n v. Solimino</span>, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, administrative decisions have preclusive effect "[w]hen an administrative agency is acting in a judicial capacity and resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate." <span class="Italic">B &#x0026; B Hardware</span>, 575 U.S. at 148-49 (quoting <span class="Italic">Univ. of Tenn. v. Elliott</span>, 478 U.S. 788, 797-98 (1986)). "Although administrative estoppel is favored as a matter of general policy, its suitability may vary according to the specific context of the rights at stake, the power of the agency, and the relative adequacy of agency procedures." <span class="Italic">Astoria</span>, 501 U.S. at 109-10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gossage v. MSPB</span>, 861 Fed. Appx. 426 (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), explained collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, "once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment, that decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry</span>, 449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). "It is well established that collateral estoppel, also known as issue preclusion, applies in the administrative context." <span class="Italic">SynQor, Inc. v. Vicor Corp</span>., 988 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (quoting <span class="Italic">MaxLinear, Inc. v. CF CRESPE LLC</span>, 880 F.3d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2018)); <span class="Italic">see also Thomas v. GSA</span>, 794 F.2d 661 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, a Postal Service arbitration decision, rendered in connection with an action appealable to the Board, would appear to meet the three prerequisites for the application of collateral estoppel since: (1) The issue before the Board, the propriety of the action appealed, would be the same as that involved in the proceeding before the arbitrator; (2) the issue before the Board would have been actually litigated before the arbitrator; and (3) the determination of the issue before the arbitrator would have been necessary to the resulting judgment.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1531"></span>Attempting to clarify the law defining collateral estoppel, <span class="Italic">McNeil v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 100 MSPR 146, 151-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16 (2005), explained that four elements would control: (1) the issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action. The fourth element, a full and fair opportunity to litigate, directly or indirectly, differed, intentionally so in the analysis of the Board, from earlier decisions that the appellant needed to be represented in an earlier proceeding for collateral estoppel to apply:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps the Board's first major published decision applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel was <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 171 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Chisholm</span>, the Board adopted what it described as the "traditional" three-part test for the application of collateral estoppel: (1) The issue to be resolved is identical to that involved in a prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; and (3) the determination of the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment. <span class="Italic">Chisholm</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 175.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 238 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit considered for the first time whether the decision of a postal arbitrator could be given collateral estoppel effect by the Board. In considering which legal standard for the application of collateral estoppel it should apply, the court relied on its own precedent in <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1983). <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>, 865 F.2d at 239. In <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant</span>, the appellant argued that it was not bound by the result of prior litigation to which it was not a party. The court disagreed, finding that the earlier judgment was against a licen<span class="Italic">see</span> of Mother's Restaurant and that the interests of Mother's Restaurant were "virtually represented" by the licen<span class="Italic">see</span>. <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant</span>, 723 F.2d at 1572-73. Applying <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> devised the following four-part collateral estoppel test: (1) The issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span>, 865 F.2d at 239.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since then, the Board has recognized that the fourth inquiry under <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> is ordinarily made only when an individual <span class="Italic">who was not a party</span> to an earlier proceeding contests an issue that was decided in that proceeding; the purpose of the "fully represented" element is to ensure that the party to be estopped has had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fisher v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 509, 515 (1994). The Board has not always been consistent in this interpretation of the fourth prong of the <span class="Italic">Kroeger</span> test and, at times, has suggested that whether to give preclusive effect to a ruling in an earlier action to which the appellant was a party depends on whether the appellant had an attorney or other representative in the earlier action. <span class="Italic">E.g., Slater v. General Services Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 378 &#x00B6; 16 (2004); <span class="Italic">Readout v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 637, 643 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To dispel any further confusion on this matter, we now announce a clarified test for collateral estoppel, and overrule <span class="Italic">Slater, Readout,</span> and similar cases to the extent that they may be inconsistent with this clarified test. Specifically, collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when: (1) The issue is identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action; (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment; and (4) the party against whom issue preclusion is sought had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior action, either as a party to the earlier action or as one whose interests were otherwise fully represented in that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under consideration in this appeal is whether collateral estoppel should be applied to previously adjudicated jurisdictional issues, so as to preclude their relitigation. While a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction does not necessarily preclude a second action on the same claim, the second claim will only be viable if the prior jurisdictional defect is cured, such as by filing the second action in a forum that does have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 338 (1995).

DHHS</span>, DC-0752-14-0313-I-1 (NP 7/9/2014) ("[A]s the Board observed in <span class="Italic">McNeil</span>, a second action is only viable if the prior jurisdictional defect is cured, for example, by filing in the proper forum, and that a second action in the same forum is generally precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Here, the appellant's claim of age discrimination does not cure the jurisdictional defect in his first appeal because, as stated above, the Board does not have jurisdiction over discrimination claims absent an otherwise appealable action not present here. <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 7.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions before <span class="Italic">McNeil</span> in 2005 often depended, in part, on an element of representation in a prior proceeding. "Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action." <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 89 MSPR 315, 318 &#x00B6; 7 (2001). A party was considered to have been "fully represented" in a prior action if he had a "full and fair chance to litigate" the issue in question. <span class="Italic">Estacio v. USPS</span>, 34 Fed. App. 677, 678 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP) (citing <span class="Italic">Mother's Rest., Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d 1566, 1569 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel and Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 79 MSPR 542, 547 (1998), summarized the concept of judicial collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...This Board, like other administrative and judicial bodies, generally defers to a final court order unless we determine that the order is flawed<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., McGean v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 15 MSPR 49, 53 (1983) (the Board does not examine reasons for bar decertification where employee is removed for failure to maintain bar membership, as long as the court had general subject matter jurisdiction to enter the order); <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 581, 589 (1997) (the Board will refuse "to collaterally attack the decision of another tribunal, statutorily charged with the authority to render the decision under review"); <span class="Italic">Dargel v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 20 MSPR 48, 52 n.4 (1984) (the Board refused to collaterally attack the dates established in a final order in a federal administrative proceeding in calculating the appellant's annuity); <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. United States</span>, 823 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (the Federal Circuit affirmed a Claims Court decision deferring to a final order of a federal district court, as affirmed and modified by the Third Circuit, in determining the claimant's appointment date for purposes of its jurisdiction to award back pay); <span class="Italic">Sonya v. Arizona School for the Deaf</span>, 743 F. Supp. 700 (D. Ariz. 1990) (once a judgment has been entered by a court of general jurisdiction, a presumption of regularity attaches that cannot be collaterally attacked unless the rendering court lacked personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction, or jurisdiction to enter the particular order involved, or if the court acted in excess of its jurisdiction or if "extrinsic" fraud is shown).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel was considered in <span class="Italic">Otherson v. DOJ</span>, 711 F.2d 267, 272 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The employee was removed following a criminal conviction for abusing aliens. MSPB precluded him from relitigating facts established at the criminal trial and sustained the discharge. Relying on <span class="Italic">Chisolm v. DLA</span>, 656 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">Otherson</span> considered appropriate preclusion in administrative proceedings of issues litigated in criminal cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Congress guaranteed employees one full opportunity to be heard...does not mean that Congress intended them to have more than one. Issue preclusion is only appropriate when a party has a full and fair opportunity to present his case at a prior hearing...and the employee may always argue in his hearing before the MSPB that the prior proceeding failed to meet this standard. Just as application of issue preclusion in civil trials does not unlawfully deprive litigants of their day in court, neither does application of issue preclusion in MSPB hearings deprive employees of their statutory hearing rights. Moreover, only those issues determined against the employee at the earlier proceeding may not be contested again. Employees whose misconduct is established preclusively will thus still have an undiminished opportunity to press other arguments before the Board, such as whether removal would promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Otherson</span> provided extensive discussion of the requirements of issue preclusion or collateral estoppel. First, the issue sought to be precluded must have been actually litigated, that is, contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court, even if some facts were stipulated. Second, the issue must have been actually and necessarily determined by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction. Whether an issue has been to determined is resolved through review of the pleadings and outcome of the first case and a determination of what the first tribunal had to consider in order to reach its conclusion. Third, the preclusion must not be unfair by binding the party to a result he had no incentive to litigate in the first case; however, there is no unfairness if the party against whom preclusion is sought vigorously litigated <span id="Page_1532"></span>the issues involved in the first case, whether or not the stakes of that case were significant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Otherson</span> was followed in a Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (on appeal from <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 27 MSPR 401 (1985)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like other judicial or quasi-judicial tribunals deciding on the basis of an adversary, litigated record, the MSPB can apply the doctrine of issue preclusion in the appropriate circumstances. <span class="Italic">Graybill v. USPS</span>, 782 F.2d 1567, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Otherson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 711 F.2d 267 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. DLA</span>, 656 F.2d 42 (3d Cir. 1981). Issue preclusion is normally applicable if (i) the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) that issue was "actually litigated" in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mother's Restaurant, Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.</span>, 723 F.2d 1566, 1569 (Fed. Cir. 1983)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 92 MSPR 370, 375-76 &#x00B6; 13 (2002), the "actually litigated" element is satisfied when an issue was properly raised by the pleadings, was submitted for determination, and was determined. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> declined to apply collateral estoppel to a USERRA claim when the appellant did not submit evidence or argument concerning the claim and the AJ discussed only the procedural history of the issue and then went on in the initial decision to dismiss resignation and retirement claims for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alford v. OPM</span>, DC-844E-13-0283-I-1 (NP 2/4/2014) ("An issue is considered 'actually litigated' when it was properly raised by the pleadings, was submitted for determination, and was determined. <span class="Italic">Banner v. United States</span>, 238 F.3d 1348, 1354-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (mere disagreement with a legal ruling does not mean that a party was denied a 'full and fair' hearing).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3287), determined that "[T]he requirement of actual litigation can be satisfied when one party raises a dispositive issue of fact and an adverse party with opportunity and motive to challenge the issue fails to actually challenge it." <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> cited <span class="Italic">Harris Trust &#x0026; Sav. Bank v. Ellis</span>, 810 F.2d 700, 705 (7th Cir. 1987). <span class="Italic">Killeen v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 666, 671, 2007 MSPB 237 (2007), noted that an issue litigated in a compliance proceeding serves to collaterally estop litigation of the same issue in a subsequent appeal from an OPM reconsideration decision. Under <span class="Italic">Killeen,</span> citing <span class="Italic">Hamiter v. USPS,</span> 96 MSPR 511, 517-18 &#x00B6; 17 (2004), an issue is "actually litigated" when it is contested by the parties and submitted for determination by a court or other neutral adjudicator.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel does not apply if a change in circumstances has occurred or if, for some other reason, the issues in the adjudications are not the same. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Quittley v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 70, 74 (1992) (declining to apply the doctrine to whether a position was managerial when the prior adjudication was in 1978 and there was no showing that the nature or duties of the position remained the same). Nor, apparently, does it apply if the appellant could have, but did not, litigate an issue in another forum because he failed to appear for scheduled hearings in that other forum and did not receive a merits determination in that forum. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lehman v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 286, 289 (1989) (suitability appeal; misconduct in a prior job was not actually litigated before the county civil service commission; despite the appellant's appeal to that organization, the appellant failed to show up for scheduled hearings and the county commission's minutes did not reflect consideration of the merits of his removal). Collateral estoppel does not apply if the issue determined in a prior tribunal was not necessary to the judgment in that case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Oshiver v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 191, 196 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 574, 579-80 (1997) (adjudicator may refrain from applying collateral estoppel if an injustice would result or other public policy considerations would be compromised). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href=" ..\Chapter05\0100-2023-12-257.html#sec5-256">Method and Scope of MSPB Review</a>," for the degree of deference or preclusion the Board and reviewing courts give to arbitration awards.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Collateral estoppel applies when the burden of proof in the later litigation is the same or less than the burden of proof in the earlier litigation. If the appellant's burden of proof in a civil contempt proceeding in district court is "clear and convincing evidence," the result of the district court case, if against the appellant, does not preclude the appellant from litigating an issue before the Board that must be established by preponderant evidence. The preponderance standard is a less stringent burden of proof than the district court standard. Having failed to convince the court under the more stringent standard, the appellant is not estopped from his attempts to persuade the Board under a less stringent standard of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matosian v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 689, 694 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an earlier adverse action appeal was found untimely, collateral estoppel precludes consideration of a subsequent appeal of the same adverse action raising a newly-stated affirmative defense, e.g., discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gibson v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-13-0384-I-1 (NP 5/15/2014) ("We conclude that the appellant is precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating the timeliness of his appeal of the agency's removal action. Because this is a dispositive basis for dismissing a subsequent adverse action appeal of the appellant's removal in 2000, it also precludes him from raising matters that could only be raised as affirmative defenses to an adverse action, such as discrimination claims"; noting that the Board was not determining whether collateral estoppel would bar a USERRA or VEOA claim). But if a prior action was reversed for lack of due process, collateral estoppel does not preclude continued litigation of the facts underlying the agency's charges.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-14-0233-I-1 (NP 2/24/2015) ("[B]ecause the administrative judge assigned to the appellant's appeal of the first removal action reversed the agency's action on the basis of due process, her determination on the substantive charges, was not necessary to the resulting judgment. Thus, the administrative judge's application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to the substantive charges was inappropriate[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The application of collateral estoppel, although frequent, is discretionary, <span class="Italic">Luna v. VA,</span> DA-0752-14-0378-I-1 (NP 4/29/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, without deciding, that all of the collateral estoppel requirements are met regarding the appellant's prior appeal, we decline to apply collateral estoppel to that appeal. The application of collateral estoppel is discretionary and the Board need not apply it in every situation in which the criteria are met. <span class="Italic">See Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (even when the requirements for applying collateral estoppel are met, it would not be error to decline to apply collateral estoppel). The considerations of public economy and private repose that underlie the doctrine of collateral estoppel must be balanced against the competing interests of fundamental fairness and due process. <span class="Italic">Tanner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 15 (2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Thus, even if the prerequisites for collateral estoppel exist, the reviewing body may refrain from applying the doctrine if injustice would result or other public policy considerations would be compromised. <span class="Italic">Tanner</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 417, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
