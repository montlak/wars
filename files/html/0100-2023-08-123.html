<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-122"><span class="space">2.</span> Movement From One Agency to Another; Transfer; Lack of Notice of Requirement of Probation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In the competitive service, appeal rights are defined by 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A)(i): whether the appellant is serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment, meaning that he has only those appeal rights provided to a probationer, or, whether under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)((A)(ii), the appellant has completed one year of current continuous <span id="Page_190"></span>service under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less. Under <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">pet. for reh'g en banc denied</span>, 329 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the individual who transfers from one agency to another maintains appeal rights if that individual has the service required by 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). As to excepted service employees who transfer, 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) grants appeal rights to preference eligibles who have completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency or in the Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission. For excepted service employees who are nonpreference eligibles, under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)((C)(ii), the individual acquires appeal rights upon completion of two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. [Refer to <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-057.html#sec1-58">Counting Service Time in a Prior Position or Appointment; <span class="Italic">McCormick</span></a>."] Notwithstanding the revision brought by <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to the analysis of continuity of service, an appellant may contend that a probationary period should not be applied on movement to a new agency if the gaining agency failed to explain the existence of the probationary requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily a transfer occurs without a change in tenure, 5 CFR 315.502 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">315.502 <span class="Italic">Tenure on transfer</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General rule</span>. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a career employee who transfers remains a career employee and a career-conditional employee who transfers remains a career-conditional employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exceptions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A career-conditional employee who transfers to a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis becomes a career employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A career employee who transfers from a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis becomes a career-conditional employee unless he or she has completed the service requirement for career tenure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question may be whether the employee's move to a different agency was by transfer. <span class="Italic">Bilodeau v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 39 MSPR 243, 247 (1988), noted that the intent of the losing and gaining agencies may have an impact on whether an employee's movement between the agencies is by transfer or through separation and new appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the conflicting evidence on this issue, we concur with the administrative judge that it is necessary to examine the "totality of the circumstances" in order to determine the nature of the appellant's appointment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGovern v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 28 MSPR 689, 692 (1985). The appellant contends that he transferred to the agency from the Department of the Navy, and that there was an understanding between the two agencies that there would be no break in service. Contrary to the administrative judge's suggestion, such an arrangement would have had legal effect if it were found to have reflected the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">See Matter of Dahlgren,</span> B-191014 (Comp. Gen. Mar. 10, 1978); <span class="Italic">Matter of Ortiz-Deliz,</span> B-184216 (Comp. Gen. Jan. 2, 1976.).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Park v. DHHS</span>, 78 MSPR 527, 530-35 (1998), involved the Board's determination not to apply the <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span> decisions, discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-121.html#sec1-120">Movement Between Positions in Same Agency; Lack of Notice of Requirement of Probation</a>," to employees who thought they were transferring from one agency to another and belatedly discovered that the receiving organization selected them from registers, meaning that they were required to serve new periods of probation. Although the result in <span class="Italic">Park</span> could well have been different under the 2002 <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> decision--and it is noted that prior to its 1998 decision in <span class="Italic">Park</span>, the Board issued a decision in July 1997 in the same case, subsequently withdrawn, that arrived at the opposite result--the 1998 <span class="Italic">Park</span> decision<span class="Italic"></span> determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_191"></span>On November 11, 1995, the appellant was terminated from his permanent tenure (tenure group I), competitive service position of GS-12 Research Physiologist with the Department of the Army in Fort Benning, Georgia. The reason indicated on the Standard Form (SF) 50 documenting the termination was appointment in the Department of Health and Human Services (the agency). On November 12, 1995, the appellant received a career appointment to the competitive service position of GS-11 Technical Writer-Editor with the agency in Atlanta, Georgia. The November 14, 1995 SF-50 documenting the appointment indicated that the appellant had been selected from a certificate and his tenure was conditional (tenure group II). On November 17, 1995, however, the agency issued a corrected SF-50 adding the remark that the appellant would be in tenure group II until he completed the one-year probationary period that began on November 12, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 5, 1996, the agency notified the appellant that he would be terminated during his probationary period, effective November 8, 1996, for inefficient performance of duties. On November 8, 1996, the appellant resigned from his position. The appellant then filed a timely petition for appeal of his "dismissal," alleging that his resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge informed the appellant that he must show that he is an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) for the Board to have jurisdiction over his appeal. The appellant responded to the administrative judge's order, arguing that he was an employee under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) because he was not serving a probationary period under an initial appointment but had been transferred to the competitive service Technical Writer-Editor position from a competitive service position in which he had already served a probationary period. To support his assertion that he had been transferred, he submitted a November 6, 1995 letter from Debra Dorsey, Personnel Management Specialist at the agency. The letter, in part, confirmed the appellant's acceptance of a "transfer" to the agency and stated that the appellant would be "transferred to a career, full-time permanent position as a Technical Writer-Editor, GS-1083-11, effective date November 12, 1995."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "employee" who may appeal an adverse action to the Board means, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "an individual in the competitive service...who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). The appellant asserts that he was an "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i), entitled to appeal to the Board, because he was transferred from a career position with the Department of the Army to a career position with the agency without a break in service. He cites the November 6, 1995 letter from Dorsey and the November 14, 1995 SF-50 to support his assertion. He argues, in effect, that under the regulations, the agency had the authority to transfer him to a permanent position without requiring him to serve a new probationary period. Citing <span class="Italic">Niles v. Department of Justice,</span> 8 MSPB 421, 9 MSPR 63 (1981), he further argues that the SF-50, by itself, could not retroactively change the nature of his appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained below, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he is an employee under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). In <span class="Italic">Niles,</span> the Board explained that, if the agency had appointed the appellant by transfer, he would retain, by reason of his career-conditional status prior to transfer, his right to appeal to the Board from his termination for misconduct under 5 USC Chapter 75. It further explained that, if the agency had appointed the appellant from a register, and thus the appellant, under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.801(a) was serving a probationary period, he would have lost his right to appeal to the Board because the Board lacks jurisdiction under 5 USC Chapter 75 of removal cases involving probationary employees<span class="Italic">. Niles,</span> 8 MSPB 421, 9 MSPR at 65. The Board further stated that the agency has the discretion to determine whether it will appoint from a register or, in the situation in <span class="Italic">Niles,</span> by promotion transfer. Where the agency has the option to appoint an individual by either means, its decision becomes a question of fact. <span class="Italic">Niles,</span> 8 MSPB 421, 9 MSPR at 66.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as previously noted, the agency argued that the appellant was selected from an external certificate and received a career appointment to the GS-11 position. It presented an SF-50, stating that the appellant had been selected from a certificate, to support its assertion. The issue, however, is not simply whether the appellant was selected from a register, but how he was appointed. In <span class="Italic">Niles,</span> even though the appellant's name appeared on a certificate of eligibles, the Board found that he had been appointed by transfer. As a result, the Board there found that the appellant was not a probationary employee. <span class="Italic">Niles,</span> 8 MSPB 421, 9 MSPR at 67.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge erred by not addressing the evidence presented by the appellant. Rather, he relied on the SF-50s submitted by the agency to find that the record indicated that the appellant was serving in a probationary period when he resigned. In doing so, the administrative judge, in effect, weighed the evidence and resolved the conflicting factual assertions by deeming the agency's evidence to be dispositive. The administrative judge thus committed prejudicial error, and the appeal must be remanded for a jurisdictional hearing and further adjudication<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Collins,</span> 70 MSPR at 339.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our July 16, 1997 Opinion and Order in this case, we found that it was unclear whether the appellant was on notice, prior to his appointment, that he would be required to serve a probationary period and thus would lose his Chapter 75 adverse action appeal rights by accepting the position. Citing <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 83 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and <span class="Italic">Exum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/EXUM_CHARLOTTE_BN_0752_94_0015_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246173.pdf">62 MSPR 344</a> (1994), we found that the agency was obligated to give the appellant prior notice of the effect of his acceptance of the position. Because there was conflicting evidence on the issue of notice, we found that the administrative judge must also address that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reconsidered this finding and conclude that it was incorrect. We have determined that our previous finding in this case was contrary to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>. In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, as in this case, the appellant left employment with a federal agency to accept employment with another federal agency. <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> 44 MSPR at 50. The Board acknowledged the appellant's claim that she had not been informed of the requirement that she serve a probationary period in her new position. The Board found, however, that it could not waive this requirement based on lack of notice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to <span class="Italic">Phillips,</span> the holdings from <span class="Italic">Briggs</span> and <span class="Italic">Exum</span> set forth the following rule: An employee must receive notice from his employing agency regarding the effect of a change in tenure before he can relinquish an agency appointment with career tenure and adverse actions appeal rights to accept another appointment <span class="Italic">within the agency</span> that lacks such tenure and appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, 62 MSPR at 349-50; <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 60 MSPR at 335-36; <span class="Italic">see also Kaiser v. Department of the Army,</span> 75 MSPR 440, 443-45 (1997). That rule depends, in part, on the principle that an employee has the rights incident to the position to which he is officially appointed. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 MSPR 316, 320, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 12 F.3d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 512 U.S. 1204, 114 S. Ct. 2673, 129 L. Ed.2d 809 (1994). An employee who has not knowingly consented to the loss of career tenure and appeal rights in accepting another appointment with the agency thus is deemed not to have "accepted" the new appointment and to have retained the rights incident to the former appointment; the Board therefore may exercise jurisdiction over an appeal of an adverse action against that employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In practical terms, moreover, the Board's rule takes into account the relative position of the two parties to a transaction involving a loss of tenure and appeal rights. As the individual's employer, the agency has readily accessible information about the appointment currently held by an employee and the appointment that he may choose to accept, and it is not unreasonable to require it to disclose that information to the employee. The employee, on the other hand, may not have any indication of the implications of a change in position or assignment (<span class="Italic">Exum</span>, for instance, involved only a change in the amount of scheduled work) because he remains with the agency and may not even have to leave the worksite to which he has been assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee has left an appointment with one agency to accept an appointment with another agency, however, the situation is different. In <span class="Italic">Briggs, Exum</span>, and <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span>, involving a change of positions within the same employing agency, the agency had all of the necessary information at hand to inform the appellant properly of the consequences of the acceptance of the new position. In cases like this appeal, however, a new employing agency may not possess and cannot be expected to have specific knowledge of the terms of the potential employee's previous employment. It should not have the same obligation to advise the employee of all possible consequences of changing positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to such an interagency appointment, the appellant in this case has identified no law, rule, or regulation imposing an obligation on the new employing agency to notify him of the effect of the appointment on his Chapter 75 adverse action appeal rights. Imposing such a notice requirement on a new employing agency could be unduly onerous. For these reasons, the more general notice obligation set forth in <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, and <span class="Italic">Kaiser</span> concerning a change of position within the same agency does not apply to this appeal involving an employee's new appointment with another employing agency. In circumstances like the present one, the potential new employee is generally in the best position to assess the situation because he knows his current employment status and may ask the potential employing agency about the terms of employment in the new position. Thus, here, the potential new employee and not the new employing agency should be held responsible for determining the consequences of the change of positions. If the appellant in this case is found on remand to have been subject to a new probationary period, the Board will not waive that requirement based on mere lack of notice at the time of his new appointment that he would be subject to a new probationary period.</p>

See</span> <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 535 (1998)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Terrill v.

When an employee moves to a new position at a different agency, the new employing agency is not responsible for determining the consequences of the change of positions. <span class="Italic">Park</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 534-35. Although both are part of the Department of Defense, the Army and DFAS are different agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Defense</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 10 (2007) (stating that the Department of the Air Force is a different agency from DFAS); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 537, 542 (1992) (the military departments are to be regarded as separate agencies for purposes related to the appointment and employment of civilian personnel).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's rationale in <span class="Italic">Park</span> does not reflect an accurate view of the federal hiring process. Agencies receiving employees from other agencies obtain preliminary employment data through SF-75 forms and other means that contain information sufficient to alert any personnel or staffing specialist to the nature of the applicant's appointment with the losing agency. It is no undue burden to require the gaining agency to notify the prospective employee of a substantial change in his or her tenure through loss of preexisting appeal rights. Nor is the employee in the best position to ascertain the nature of the appointment with the gaining agency. The employee may lack the sophistication to inquire as to the nature of the appointment--assuming it to be by transfer--or the employee may not know that selection from a register entails a new probationary period. The gaining agency's personnel specialists should know these technicalities and provide information and advice to the applicant to that agency concerning the implications of a particular type of appointment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Irrespective of one's view of <span class="Italic">Park,</span> the Federal Circuit adopted the rationale of that decision in <span class="Italic">Carrow v. MSPB</span>, 626 F.3d 1348, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 2010), involving an employee who held a position with the Army, took a temporary appointment with the VA and, following termination, argued that he should not have lost the tenure he acquired with the Army when the VA failed to inform him of the consequences of accepting the temporary appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In this case, it is indisputable that Mr. Carrow was not an "employee" at the time he was removed from his position at the DVA. He had previously been an employee when he was employed with the Department of the Army, but he is not seeking reinstatement to his position with the Army or suggesting that the Army acted improperly in some manner that induced him to leave his position there. Instead, his argument is that the DVA failed to give him complete information about the circumstances of his DVA appointment from which he might have ascertained that, by accepting the DVA position, he was giving up the rights granted to "employees" under section 7513. Even if his factual allegations are true, his legal argument fails because section 7513(d) does not give the Board jurisdiction over an appeal from a removal by a person who does not qualify as an "employee." <span class="Italic">See Anderson</span>, 12 F.3d at 1071 n.4 (in an appeal from an adverse action against an appellant who does not qualify as a statutory "employee," the appellant may not invoke the "involuntary resignation" theory of Board jurisdiction). By statute, Mr. Carrow's position with the DVA did not carry Board appeal rights, and the DVA's failure to advise Mr. Carrow of the terms of his appointment does not create appeal rights for positions as to which Congress has not given the Board appellate jurisdiction. Mr. Carrow has not suggested that there is any statutory or regulatory requirement that he be given such notification, nor does he point to any authority supporting his contention that, in the absence of such notification, he is entitled as a matter of due process to retain his previous appeal rights in his new position. Accordingly, we hold that any failure on the part of the DVA to provide full information to Mr. Carrow regarding the terms of his employment with the DVA did not give the Board jurisdiction over his appeal seeking reinstatement to his position at the DVA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has reached essentially the same result in similar cases, although it has followed a different line of analysis. In <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, an employee transferred from a position with one agency in which he enjoyed full appeal rights to a position in a different agency in which he was required to serve a probationary period. When the employee was notified that he would be terminated during his probationary period, he sought to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The employee argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he could not be treated as a probationary employee in his new position because he had not been told that he would have to serve a probationary period in that new position. The Board noted that it had adopted a rule that the employing agency must inform an employee of the effect of a change in tenure when the employee relinquishes an appointment having adverse action appeal rights to accept another appointment within the same agency that lacks such appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Park</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 534, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Exum v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 344, 349-50 (1994). In such a case, the Board explained, an employee who has not knowingly consented to the loss of appeal rights is deemed not to have surrendered those rights when accepting the new appointment within the same agency. However, the Board held that when an employee has left an appointment with one agency to accept an appointment with another agency, "the situation is different." <span class="Italic">Park</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 534. Because the new employing agency "may not possess and cannot be expected to have specific knowledge of the terms of the potential employee's previous employment," it does not have an obligation to inform the employee "of the effect of the appointment on his Chapter 75 adverse action appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 535.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge in this case relied on the <span class="Italic">Park</span> rule in holding that the DVA was not required to inform Mr. Carrow that his appointment would result in the loss of his appeal rights, and therefore Mr. Carrow could not invoke those rights as a means of obtaining Board review of his removal. Because the <span class="Italic">Park</span> rule led the Board to the same result that we reach in this case, it is not necessary for us to decide whether the Board's analysis in this case (or in the <span class="Italic">Park</span> line of cases) was correct. We likewise have no occasion in this case to approve or disapprove the Board's rule in <span class="Italic">Exum</span> and its progeny that if an employee moves within the same agency from a position with appeal rights to one lacking appeal rights and the agency does not inform him of the effect the move will have on his appeal rights, the employee will be deemed to have retained those rights. <span class="Italic">See Rice v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 522 F.3d 1311, 1317-18 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Yeressian v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 21, 27 (2009); <span class="Italic">Pagan v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 212, 215 (2009); <span class="Italic">Exum</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 349-50.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit approached the issue of an employee's movement to a different agency in <span class="Italic">D'Angelo v. DOJ</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3069). The employee, in the excepted service in the Army, sought and received a position at the Justice Department. The employee thought she was transferring with no break in tenure. Justice, however, first appointed her to an excepted service job, then discovered that its first appointment was not proper and, unknown to the employee, placed her into a competitive service job from a civil service register. D'Angelo unknowingly became a probationer after she began her work at Justice. When she was dismissed during her probationary period, the Board determined that it lacked jurisdiction, essentially concluding that the employee's tenure did not follow her from Army to Justice. D'Angelo appealed her dismissal from Justice (claiming that she was tenured) and her separation from Army (claiming that her departure was involuntary because the Army did not tell her she would lose tenure). The reviewing court sustained the Board's determination that there was no involuntary separation from Army, but as to Justice, the court reversed the Board and remanded the case for discovery and hearing. The court observed that the existence of the authority of Justice to appoint D'Angelo to a position that would allow her tenure (or appeal rights) to survive the movement from one agency to another was an issue the Board must consider:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D'Angelo was formerly an Intelligence Specialist with the Army. That position was a GS-13 position in the excepted service. When she saw a published vacancy announcement by DOJ for a Security Specialist position at the GS-14 level, she submitted an application to DOJ. The announcement did not indicate whether the position was an excepted service or a competitive service position. When she was offered the Security Specialist position, she accepted it and requested that the Army transfer her to DOJ. D'Angelo began her employment at DOJ in mid-October of 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due to some confusion on the part of the Army and DOJ regarding how to characterize the nature of her move from the Army to DOJ, D'Angelo's employee status was altered several times during her first month at DOJ. Allegedly, the agencies attempted to transfer her to DOJ by means of a Veterans Readjustment Act ("VRA") appointment. However, the alleged attempt at a VRA appointment met with some difficulties because the two agencies came to the realization that VRA appointments are not authorized for appointments above the GS-11 level, <span class="Italic">see</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4124(b)(1)(A) (1994). In addition, there was also confusion as to whether the Security Specialist position at DOJ was an excepted service or a competitive service position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After D'Angelo had already begun work as a Security Specialist, DOJ decided to assign D'Angelo to the status of a temporary employee while it tried to sort out what her proper status should be. Then after a few weeks, DOJ decided to assign D'Angelo to the status of a career conditional employee in the competitive service with a one year probationary period. Both times it reassigned D'Angelo, DOJ did not inform her of how her new employee status would affect her appeal rights. At around the same time as DOJ reassigned D'Angelo the second time, the Army apparently processed D'Angelo's separation as a termination based on her appointment to another agency rather than as the transfer D'Angelo had requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_193"></span>In May of 1996, while D'Angelo was still in the one year probationary period, DOJ informed D'Angelo that she was being terminated for unacceptable performance. D'Angelo appealed her termination from DOJ to the Board contending that she had appeal rights because she was initially appointed to an excepted service position. In addition, D'Angelo appealed her termination from the Army to the Board contending that the Army should have transferred her to DOJ rather than have terminated her for reason of appointment to another agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without allowing D'Angelo to depose any DOJ personnel, the Board decided that it did not have appellate jurisdiction to hear D'Angelo's appeal of her termination from the DOJ. The Board reasoned that D'Angelo was a probationary employee without appeal rights since she had been terminated for post-appointment reasons and had not claimed that her termination was based upon discrimination due to marital status or partisan political reasons, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.804, 315.806.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the Board decided that it did not have appellate jurisdiction to hear D'Angelo's appeal of her separation from the Army. The Board reasoned that it did not have jurisdiction over either the Army's action of terminating her by reason of appointment to another agency or the transfer D'Angelo contends should have been made because neither a termination nor a transfer initiated by an employee in order to accept new employment amount to an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court may set aside any Board action, findings, or conclusions found to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first turn to the Board's disposal of D'Angelo's termination from DOJ. D'Angelo has made nonfrivolous allegations that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal of her dismissal from DOJ. She has alleged that she was transferred from the Army to DOJ. In addition, she has pointed to an exhibit which indicates that her appointment to DOJ was, at least initially, one to an excepted service position. If D'Angelo was properly appointed to an excepted service position at DOJ, then her appeal rights vested and the Board has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record before us, including oral argument by DOJ, does not substantially support the Board's determination that the Security Specialist position was a competitive service position. Although the record indicates that, after D'Angelo had worked for a few weeks, DOJ eventually classified the Security Specialist position as a competitive service position, it still remains unclear whether that position could have been or was an excepted service position at some time prior to DOJ's classification of that position as a competitive service position. In addition, the record before us is completely lacking in evidence indicating whether or not DOJ even had the discretion or authority to categorize or re-categorize the position as a competitive service or excepted service position. These unresolved issues are key to the determination of the jurisdiction of the Board over D'Angelo's termination from DOJ. Because the Board's determination that it did not have jurisdiction over D'Angelo's appeal of her termination from DOJ is unsupported by substantial evidence, we vacate and remand the matter to the Board to address the aforementioned unresolved issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the Board's dismissal of D'Angelo's appeal of her termination from the Army, we believe the Board correctly determined that it did not have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D'Angelo argues that because she requested a transfer rather than a termination due to an appointment at another agency, her separation from the Army was involuntary. Employee resignations are presumed to be voluntary<span class="Italic">. See Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587 (Ct. Cl. 1975). This presumption will prevail unless the plaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to establish that the resignation was involuntarily extracted. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Evidence that the resignation was obtained by agency misinformation or deception may be sufficient to prove that the resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D'Angelo has not put forth any evidence of misinformation or deception on the part of the Army. Although she has alleged that the Army did not offer her any information regarding whether her change of position would result in a change in her appeal rights, lack of information is not misinformation. Furthermore, she has not alleged that the Army misled her or deceived her into believing she would maintain her appeal rights. D'Angelo did not ask the Army about her appeal rights, and the Army did not volunteer any such information. Moreover, the Army had no way of knowing whether D'Angelo would maintain her appeal rights in her new position until DOJ informed the Army whether the position at DOJ was in the excepted service or the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because D'Angelo has failed to produce evidence to rebut the presumption that her resignation from the Army was voluntary, she has failed to show that there was an adverse action against her. The Board was correct in dismissing D'Angelo's appeal of her termination from the Army for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Davis v. Corp. for National &#x0026; Community Service</span>, DA-1221-13-0040-W-1 (NP 5/22/2014), appeal rights are not created even if an employee is misled by the gaining agency as to the need for probation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the agency could not subject her to a probationary period without first informing her and, therefore, that she was entitled to due process and/or to retain the rights she held in her SES position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 359. She cites <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Social Security Administration</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67 (2005), which is inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, the Board found that the appellant's move from one agency to another did not affect her Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">Hughes</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 67, &#x00B6; 6. Thus, the issue was not whether Hughes' appeal rights changed as a result of her appointment at a new agency but, rather, whether she contractually waived her appeal rights when she signed a probationary period agreement after her appointment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 7. Contrary to the appellant's assertion, <span class="Italic">Hughes</span> does not hold that an employee moving from one agency to another must make a knowing and voluntary decision to accept a position requiring a new probationary period; rather, it holds that a contractual waiver of appeal rights cannot be enforceable without consideration. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Thompson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 545, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (explaining that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hughes</span> was based "on the principle that an enforceable contract does not exist unless it is based on bargained-for consideration and the fact that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Hughes</span> was already employed with the agency when she signed the probationary agreement and had not knowingly and intentionally waived appeal rights before starting her position with the agency"). Indeed, the Board has held that a federal agency hiring a current federal employee from another federal agency is not required to provide notice to that employee regarding how her new appointment may affect her Board appeal rights.[5] <span class="Italic">Park v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 527, 534-35 (1998) (finding that, if the appellant were required to complete a new probationary period upon moving to a different agency, the Board would not waive that requirement based on the mere lack of notice at the time of his new appointment that he would be subject to a new probationary period). <span class="Italic">See Carrow v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 626 F.3d 1348, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We recognize that the appellant's claim is not simply that the agency failed to inform her of a probationary period requirement but also that the agency affirmatively told her that she would not be required to serve a new probationary period. Even if the agency misinformed her about this requirement, this error would not confer Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 12 F.3d 1069, 1069-71 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (rejecting petitioners' contention that, although they admittedly held temporary positions which precluded them from meeting the definition of an employee, the doctrine of equitable estoppel should confer Board jurisdiction because the agency allegedly misled them regarding the nature of their appointments).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 86 MSPR 476, 480-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-16 (2000) (jurisdictional hearing required when evidence conflicted on whether appellant was, or should have been, appointed to position through transfer rather than through probationary appointment from register; the AJ erred by deciding the case based on the agency's documentary evidence when that evidence conflicted with appellant's submissions and representations).
