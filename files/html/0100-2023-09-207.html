<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-204"><span class="space">4.</span> Deficient Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellants are represented by lawyers in less than half of all Board appeals. Board rules are complex, and the decisional law governing the process is more complex. AJs are given some discretion to assist individuals in correcting errors in their appeals so that they are not defaulted for lack of legal proficiency. The Board's internal procedural guidelines concerning what are called "deficient petitions for appeal" are in MSPB Order 1050.10 (Oct. 27, 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Policy and Procedures for Handling Deficient Petitions for Appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;PURPOSE. This order provides the policy and procedures for handling deficient petitions for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;POLICY. The Board will reject any petition for appeal that does not contain the appellant's signature. Other deficiencies may be the basis for rejection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;USE OF FORM. Whenever you reject a petition for appeal, you must use the Standard Rejection Notice-Petition for Appeal Form (see attachment 1)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;LACK OF SIGNATURE. You are not required to reject the petition based on any of the listed deficiencies, with one exception. You must reject a petition for appeal that does not contain the appellant's signature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;FILING DATE. The original filing date of a rejected petition shall be used for the purpose of determining the timeliness of the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;DOCKET DATE. The date of refiling will be used as the docket date, to trigger the 120-day deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;ABSENCE OF COPIES. You have three options available whenever an appellant fails to submit a copy of the petition or the attachments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;You may reject the petition and attachments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;If the petition and attachments are not voluminous, you may accept the petition, docket the appeal, and copy the submissions for service on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;You may copy voluminous attachments, but you should refrain from doing so unless you believe it would be a personal or financial hardship for the appellant to provide copies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;ABSENCE OF INFORMATION PERTAINING TO REPRESENTATIVE. Where a designated representative's address, telephone number, and signature are not provided, you may docket the appeal and treat the appellant as <span class="Italic">pro se</span> until such time as the appropriate information is furnished.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;UNTIMELY RESPONSE. Whenever the appellant submits an untimely response to this standard rejection notice, you should treat it in the same fashion as an untimely appeal by accepting the petition and issuing an acknowledgment order that contains the following language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your original petition for appeal was rejected for failure to meet the Board's filing requirements. You were instructed to refile your appeal within 15 days (25 days for overseas locations) of the date of the rejection letter. The date of refiling is the date your petition for appeal is postmarked or the date of receipt if you personally delivered it to the regional office. Because your appeal appears to have been refiled after the 15 day time limit, it may be untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have the burden of proof on the issue of timeliness. Accordingly, I ORDER you to file evidence and argument showing that your appeal was timely filed or that good cause existed for the delay. Your submission must be filed within 15 days of the date of this Order. The agency may file a response on this issue within 25 days of the date of this Order. The record on this issue will close on that date unless I determine that a requested hearing should be held. No evidence or argument on the timeliness issue filed after the close of record will be accepted unless you show that it is new and material evidence which was unavailable before the record closed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an appellant attempts to cure a deficient appeal, the AJ should avoid defaulting the appellant for minor errors or delays in the process. As to the <span id="Page_1185"></span>delayed refiling of an timely filed but technically deficient appeal, <span class="Italic">Toombs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 78, 81-82 (1995), the Board majority determined, over Member Amador's dissent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant's timely-filed petition for appeal was deficient. Thus, she was required to perfect her petition by refiling it with the deficiencies corrected within fifteen days from the notice dated March 25, 1994. She did not refile her appeal until April 12, 1994, one day late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we remand the petition for appeal for adjudication on the merits. To dismiss the petition--which was timely filed--because the appellant failed by one day to timely respond to the administrative judge's order to refile a corrected petition for appeal, would amount to imposing the most severe sanction available: Dismissing the appeal for failure to prosecute. The Board will impose a sanction on a party only "as necessary to serve the ends of justice." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 244, 249 (1992). The sanction of dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute should not be imposed for a single instance of failure to comply with a Board order. <span class="Italic">Carrier v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 54, 57 (1994); <span class="Italic">Diaz v. DHHS</span>, 57 MSPR 325, 328 (1993). In the absence of bad faith or evidence that the appellant intends to abandon her appeal, dismissal for failure to prosecute is generally inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Slaughter v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 10 (1993). Furthermore, even though such a sanction should be avoided especially where an appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, the fact that a party is represented by an attorney does not require a different result. <span class="Italic">See Morris v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 401 (1988) (the Board reinstated an appeal where the appellant's attorney failed to respond to two separate orders of the administrative judge, but presented sufficient evidence on petition for review to show that he did not abandon the appeal and made good faith efforts to comply with the administrative judge's orders).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant who is represented by an attorney, has not acted in bad faith, and there is nothing that would lead us to believe that she intended to abandon her appeal. Indeed, all indications are to the contrary. She acted well within the time limits when she originally filed her petition for appeal, even though the agency did not provide her with the Board's appeal form and regulations. Further, she promptly responded to the administrative judge's timeliness show-cause order, and explained that she had refiled the appeal within fifteen days of her actual receipt of the deficiency notice. Thus, we conclude that, under the circumstances, denying the appellant an opportunity for a review of her case on the merits would not serve the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board followed <span class="Italic">Toombs</span> when it remanded for adjudication an appeal that was timely filed but returned to the appellant by the region because he did not file the original and one copy of the appeal. He corrected the deficiency by supplying the additional copy of the appeal, but the correction was a couple of days late. The appeal should not have been dismissed, <span class="Italic">Marcoullier v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 70 MSPR 412, 414 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant's initial filing was submitted on July 12, 1995, twenty-one days after the effective date of the agency's action. It was, therefore, timely filed. However, because the administrative judge determined that the initial filing was deficient, she required the appellant to refile it with the deficiencies corrected within fifteen days of the notice dated August 8, 1995. As noted above, the appellant did not refile his corrected appeal until August 25, 1995, two days late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we remand the appeal for adjudication on the merits. To dismiss the appeal, which was timely filed, because the appellant failed by two days to comply with the administrative judge's order to refile a corrected petition for appeal would amount to the most severe sanction available, i.e., dismissal for failure to prosecute<span class="Italic">. See Toombs v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 78, 81 (1995). The Board will impose a sanction on a party only "as necessary to serve the ends of justice." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43. In the absence of bad faith, or evidence that the appellant intends to abandon his appeal, dismissal for failure to prosecute is generally inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Slaughter v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 10, 12 (1993). Here, the appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, has not acted in bad faith, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that he intended to abandon his appeal. On the contrary, he acted within the time limits when he originally filed his petition for appeal, and he promptly responded to the administrative judge's show-cause Order explaining that he refiled the corrected petition as soon as possible after his receipt of the deficiency notice. Thus, we conclude that, under all of the circumstances, denying the appellant an opportunity for a review of his appeal would not serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Toombs</span>, 69 MSPR at 81-82.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marcoullier</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Colello v. Dept. of Army</span>, 93 MSPR 663, 665-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2003), involving an appeal that was timely but deficient because the appellant did not specify the appealed action or the name and address of the agency that took the action and because he did not provide an original and a copy of his appeal. The refiled appeal was untimely, but the Board sent the case back to the AJ for adjudication:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision dismissed the appeal as untimely filed despite Board precedent indicating that the appeal was timely and should be considered on its merits. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22. In <span class="Italic">Marcoullier v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 412 (1996), an AJ had dismissed an appeal as untimely filed where an appellant had originally filed a timely, deficient petition for appeal and had untimely refiled a perfected petition. The Board reversed the AJ's initial decision because the appeal was timely filed as the appellant had timely filed his original petition for appeal and because a dismissal would not serve the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In spite of the similarities between <span class="Italic">Marcoullier</span> and the present case, the initial decision found the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Marcoullier</span> inapplicable. The initial decision reasoned that <span class="Italic">Marcoullier's</span> original petition for appeal was deficient merely because the appellant failed to file a duplicate copy of his otherwise sufficient petition whereas, here, the initial decision found the appellant's original petition for appeal so deficient that it was as if the appellant had never filed a petition with the Board....&#8197;Because the appellant did not timely refile a perfected petition for appeal, the initial decision deemed the appeal untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision's reasoning and conclusion are inconsistent with Board law. The appellant was required to file an appeal of his November 23, 2001 removal by December 23, 3001. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). Contrary to the initial decision, the date the appellant filed his original, deficient petition for appeal, December 12, 2001, is the date of filing for the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Toombs v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 78, 81 (1995). Moreover, we find that the importance or significance of a petition's deficiency is not relevant to a determination of whether the petition has been timely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l), 1201.22, 1201.23; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Toombs,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 80-81 (finding an appeal timely filed even though the original petition for appeal did not clearly indicate the appealed action or its effective date and the appellant did not provide an original and copy of her appeal, and the appellant refiled the appeal after the after the refiling deadline). Thus, the appeal was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To dismiss this timely filed appeal because the appellant did not refile a perfected petition for appeal by the deadline specified in the field office's notice would amount to imposing the most severe sanction available, namely, dismissing the appeal for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">See Toombs,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 81. Sanctions should be imposed only "as necessary to serve the ends of justice." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">see Wright v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 244, 249 (1992). The extreme sanction of dismissal of a timely appeal for failure to prosecute should not be imposed for a single instance of failure to comply with a Board field office's notice. <span class="Italic">See Carrier v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 54, 57 (1994). In the absence of bad faith or evidence that the appellant intends to abandon his appeal, a timely-filed appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 369 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 (2000); <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 10 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal file presents nothing to indicate that the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant acted in bad faith. Although the appellant should have timely responded to the field office's notice to refile his appeal by December 31, 2001, the notice did not indicate the consequences for failing to meet that deadline but, rather, indicated that "no further action will be taken in this matter" if the appellant did not refile. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fickie v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 525 &#x00B6; 24 (2000) (reasoning that sanctions may be warranted where a party has been warned that sanctions may be imposed for failing to comply with an order). Further, although the appellant should have responded to the acknowledgment order, the acknowledgment order did not indicate that the appeal would be dismissed if the AJ found it untimely, the appellant may have believed that he had effectively responded to the acknowledgment order's concern in an earlier filing, and the appeal file presents nothing that would lead us to believe that the appellant intended to abandon his appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.; cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 34, 38 (1996) (finding that the appellants had not abandoned their appeals although they should have responded to the acknowledgment orders' notice regarding timeliness). Under these circumstances, the appellant's single failure to respond to a Board field office's notice is not grounds for dismissing the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Andrews v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 202, 206 (1996).</p>
