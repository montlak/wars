<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(12)&#x2003;Take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Merit systems principles established as part of the Reform Act and codified at 5 USC 2301 provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;This section shall apply to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;an Executive agency; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;the Government Printing Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with the following merit system principles:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Recruitment should be from qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of <span id="Page_3749"></span>society, and selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;All employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition, and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Equal pay should be provided for work of equal value, with appropriate consideration of both national and local rates paid by employers in the private sector, and appropriate incentives and recognition should be provided for excellence in performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;All employees should maintain high standards of integrity, conduct, and concern for the public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;The Federal work force should be used efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;Employees should be retained on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(7)&#x2003;Employees should be provided effective education and training in cases in which such education and training would result in better organizational and individual performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(8)&#x2003;Employees should be--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, or coercion for partisan political purposes, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) prohibited from using their official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election or a nomination for election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(9)&#x2003;Employees should be protected against reprisal for the lawful disclosure of information which the employees reasonably believe evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;In administering the provisions of this chapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;with respect to any agency (as defined in section 2302(a)(2)(C) of this title), the President shall, pursuant to the authority otherwise available under this title, take any action, including the issuance of rules, regulations, or directives; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;with respect to any entity in the executive branch which is not such an agency or part of such an agency, the head of such entity shall, pursuant to authority otherwise available, take any action, including the issuance of rules, regulations, or directives;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">which is consistent with the provisions of this title and which the President or the head, as the case may be, determines is necessary to ensure that personnel management is based on and embodies the merit system principles.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To follow the decisions, readers, recall that 5 USC 2302(b)(12) was formerly 2302(b)(11).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 601-03 (1984), added definition to the phrase "implementing or directly concerning" the merit system principles. At issue was an OSC complaint that the respondent deliberately idled a subordinate, an SES member. The Board found a violation of [then] 2302(b)(11):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Wells</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 243 (1980)], defines "implementing" to mean "to carry out, accomplish, fulfill or give practical effect to." As applied in <span class="Italic">Wells</span>, the Board found that the violated statute prescribed processes and procedures that were deliberately designed to accomplish a specific result. Section 3131(7) protects members of the SES from arbitrary and capricious actions but does not itself prescribe a process or method to effect that protection. The term "implementing" requires more than section 3131(7) provides.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 3131(7) does not "implement" merit principles, the Board must decide whether section 3131(7) "directly concerns" a merit principle within the meaning of section 2302(b)(11). The Board has never previously interpreted the term. <span class="Italic">See Wells</span> at 229, 1 MSPR at 242. The term is undefined in the statute and has no explanatory legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying paragraph (11) of section 2302(b), we must consider the expressed purpose of that provision. The Senate Committee added paragraph (11) [then (10)]"to make unlawful those actions which are inconsistent with merit principles, but which do not fall within the...[other] categories of personnel practices," <span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 1486-1487. Too technical a reading of paragraph (11) would defeat its purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With the purpose of paragraph (11) of section 2302(b) for guidance, we must examine whether paragraph (7) of section 3131 directly concerns the merit principles. Section 3131(7) is part of Title IV of the Reform Act, 92 Stat. 1154.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title IV created the SES, an elite corps of senior management officials, distinct from all other government services. All of the provisions relating specifically to the SES appear in Title IV of the Reform Act to effect a total and coherent system. Section 402 of the Reform Act added a new subchapter to chapter 31 of Part III of title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3131 states that the purpose of the new subchapter is to ensure that the executive management is responsive to the needs, policies, and goals of the Nation and otherwise is of the highest quality; and states that the SES is to be "administered" under fourteen enumerated guidelines. Specifically, paragraph (7) of section 3131 requires that the SES be administered to "protect senior executives from arbitrary and capricious actions." This injunction directly concerns the merit principle in paragraph (b)(5) of section 2301 invoked by Special Counsel, i.e., the principle that the Federal work force should be used efficiently and effectively."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Harvey argues however, that he does not "administer" the provisions of Chapter 31 and thus section 3131(7) does not apply to him. We reject so narrow a reading of section 3131. The SES is administered not only by agency heads and OPM, who are charged in the broader context of organizing the SES by defining SES positions, determining the number of SES positions, their distribution among agencies and between career and non-career positions, and establishment of qualifications for positions, but also by the action of individual supervisors of SES personnel. Harvey therefore was subject to the standards in section 3131(7) and violated section 2302(b)(11).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An OSC disciplinary action case provided the vehicle for additional explanation of the relation between merit system principles and prohibited personnel practices. In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561, 579-81 (1993), the Board faulted respondent's hiring of a politically well-connected applicant through the inappropriate use of temporary appointment authority. As the Board explained (the references to "RD" are to the recommended decision of the Board's ALJ):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(11), United States Code, Title 5, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action, shall not, with respect to such authority...take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we disagree with the RD's finding that a violation of section 2302(b)(11) in this case requires proof of an improper motive. The statute simply does not contain that requirement, and the plain words of the statute show that only three elements must be proved by the preponderance of the evidence in order to find a violation of 5 USC 2302 (b)(11). These elements are: (1) a personnel action was taken; (2) the taking of this action violated a civil service law, rule or regulation; and (3) the law, rule or regulation violated implements or directly concerns a merit system principle. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 599-600 (1984), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 241 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The RD's reliance on <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 802 F.2d 537 (D.C. Cir. 1986), and <span class="Italic">Starrett v. Special Counsel</span>, 792 F.2d 1246, 1253, n.12 (4th Cir. 1986), to conclude that improper motive is a necessary element of finding a violation of this section is misplaced. Unlike this case, the courts' discussion of motive and intention in <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> and <span class="Italic">Starrett</span> was appropriate because the charges in those cases specifically stated that personnel actions were <span class="Italic">deliberately</span> taken that violated laws which included elements requiring proof of improper motive. For example, in the <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> and <span class="Italic">Starrett</span> discussions of improper motive, the courts were addressing how the personnel actions of the respondents had violated 5 USC 2302(b)(8) and (b)(9). These sections prohibited reprisal for certain protected conduct, and reprisal requires proof of an improper motive.... We therefore find that the elements of proof of a violation of section 2302(b)(11) depend on the specific charges and, thus, may or may not include proof of an improper motive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3750"></span>Here, the respondents are charged with violating 5 CFR 316.401, 330.102 and Chapter 316 of the Federal Personnel Manual. As discussed previously, section 316.401 states that the purpose of temporary limited employment is to "meet an administrative need for temporary employment, such as to fill a temporary position or a continuing position for a temporary period." As we have found in our discussion of the respondents' violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(6), the respondents' improper use of the TLA under this charge was contrary to the purpose of temporary limited employment. To the extent that FPM chapter 316 pertains to the conditions under which an agency may correctly use limited employment, the respondents also violated FPM chapter 316 by their improper use of the TLA.[18]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[18]&#x2003;Provisions of the FPM have long been considered rules for the purposes of the Board's exercise of authority under 5 USC 1204(f) to review "any rule or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pollard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 MSPR 566, 569 (1992), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Devine</span>, 8 MSPR 640, 642 n.1 (1981). By analogy, we find that provisions of FPM chapter 316 which prescribe the conditions for making a TLA constitute "rules" for purposes of 5 USC 2302(b)(11).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These rules and regulation do not include any element of motive, and it is therefore unnecessary to prove an improper motive to establish a violation of section 2302(b)(11) through a violation of the rules or regulation. Moreover, the charge itself did not contain words that would require proof of motive or intent. Motive or intent is, however, a proper factor to consider for the purpose of determining the penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 29 MSPR 631, 634 (1986); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 2302(a)(2) designates an "appointment" as a covered personnel action within the meaning of the statute, we find the first element satisfied. Use of the TLA authority to make the appointment in this case violated civil service laws, rules and regulations, as discussed, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The violated provisions directly concern the merit system principle contained in 5 USC 2301(b)(1), which states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Recruitment should be from qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of society, and selection and advancement should be determined solely on the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, <span class="Italic">after fair and open competition which assures that all receive equal opportunity</span>. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Baillie v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DC-1221-20-0838-W-1 (NP 5/26/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Protected disclosures in an IRA appeal can include disclosures that an agency violated merit systems principles. <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Luecht v.

Assuming, without finding, that "recruitment" includes salary as well as hiring, neither in her disclosures nor during the proceedings below did the appellant provide a basis for believing that the salary she offered was not based on her education and experience....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Brown</span>, 61 MSPR 559, 567-70 (1994), concluded that a merit system principle violation occurred when the hiring process was manipulated to exclude from selection an individual with priority consideration rights under the OPM Displaced Employee Program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count two charges Brown and Nelson with violating 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) (1988) by failing to timely correct the violations of 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406(c) and (d) (1987), regulations describing agency responsibilities to displaced employees and the objection process and which implement merit system principles. The OSC described the violation as respondents' lengthy delay in appointing Nielson after OPM rejected INS' objection to Nielson.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a violation of section 2302(b)(11) it is necessary to show that a personnel action was taken or not taken; that such action violated a law, rule, or regulation; and that the violated law, rule, or regulation is one which implements or directly concerns merit system principles. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 MSPR 561, 579 (1993). The CALJ found preponderant evidence supported the (b)(11) charge against both respondents on the basis that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406(c) and (d) were violated by Friday's appointment, that respondents deliberately failed to take timely corrective action after OPM denied INS objections, and that the violated regulations implemented or directly concerned merit system principles 2301(b)(5) and (6). Respondents do not contest the finding that the violated regulations implement or directly concern merit system principles, but they do except to the CALJ's other principal findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondents argue that the CALJ erred in finding a violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) because the delay in taking corrective action does not constitute a failure to take a personnel action within the meaning of section 2302(b)(11). Whether a delay in acting constitutes a failure to act under section 2302(b)(11) is a question of first impression. Under the circumstances of this case, the Board concurs in the CALJ's finding that the lengthy delay in taking corrective action constitutes a failure to act within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Failure is defined as the nonperformance of something due, required or expected. <span class="Italic">Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language</span> 510 (1989). Here, in order to correct the regulatory violations, respondents were required to regularize the certificate, i.e., appoint Nielson or separate Friday after OPM, on December 16, 1987, rejected their objection to Nielson. Respondents, however, refused to take action and submitted a second objection which OPM again rejected in a March 31, 1988, letter directing INS to take corrective action within 30 days. After receipt of this letter, respondents still failed to take action. Finally, after OPM directed INS to appoint Nielson or separate Friday within ten days of an August 24, 1988, letter, respondents, on September 10, 1988, offered Nielson a public affairs position in the Office of the Regional Commissioner. Because the public affairs specialist position was classified as sensitive, Nielson's appointment was subject to a security investigation. This process, which lasted only two months in the case of Jane Friday, was not completed until December 30, 1988. Nielson was finally appointed effective January 17, 1989. We find that under these circumstances the delay in taking corrective action must be viewed as nonperformance of a required act and thus constitutes a failure to act within the meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The personnel action that Brown failed to take was a corrective action. A corrective action is a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii) (1988). Accordingly, Brown's argument that issuance of a certificate is not a personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A) misconstrues the action at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown and Nelson next argue that the CALJ incorrectly found that they violated 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406(c) and (d). Section 330.305(b) prohibits agencies from issuing a certificate when an eligible displaced employee is available. Section 332.406(c) and (d) prohibits agencies from passing over an eligible displaced employee to appoint another candidate on the certificate unless the agency has more than one position to fill from the same certificate and reserves one position for the eligible being challenged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Brown and Nelson, they could not have violated these regulations because they were not involved in Friday's appointment. Brown and Nelson, however, were not charged with improperly appointing Friday in violation of the regulations. Rather, Brown and Nelson were charged with failure to timely correct the improper appointment of Friday. Therefore, respondents' argument concerning their responsibility for the appointment of Friday is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Brown and Nelson argue that they did not violate 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406 because the regulations do not contain time limits and therefore cannot be violated by a failure to take corrective action in a timely manner. This argument is unpersuasive. OPM, the author of the displaced employee regulations and charged with their enforcement, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 5.1, found that the appointment of Ms. Friday from the certificate was illegal and, on three separate occasions, ordered that action be taken to correct an appointment made contrary to the regulations. Because Brown and Nelson failed to appoint Nielson or separate Friday within the timeframes set up by OPM, they were engaged in a continuing violation of 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406(c) and (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that respondents failed to take a personnel action in the form of a corrective action and that the failure constitutes a continuing violation of 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.305(b) and 332.406(c) and (d), 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11) requires a showing that the violated regulations implement or directly concern the merit system principles in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b). The CALJ found that the violated regulations implement and directly concern merit system principles (b)(5) and (6) and respondents have not objected to that finding. Accordingly, we find that respondents violated 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. VA</span>, 75 MSPR 219, 222 (1997), outlined, concerning a stay application, the theory of an OSC corrective action based on a constitutional due process violation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC contends that the agency violated 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), which makes it a prohibited personnel practice to "take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." The merit systems principle relied on by OSC provides: "All employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management without regard to political affiliation, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition, and with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2. A tenured federal employee, i.e., one against whom an adverse action can be taken only for cause, has a constitutional right to minimum due process--the core elements of which are prior notice of the action and an opportunity to respond--when an adverse action is taken<span class="Italic">. Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680 (1991). According to OSC, the notice and opportunity-to-respond provisions in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) "implement" and "directly concern" the merit system principle requiring proper regard for employees' constitutional rights; OSC thus concludes that the agency's failure to afford Mr. Fletcher advance notice and an opportunity to respond when it reduced him in grade was a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OSC does not cite any authority for the proposition that an agency commits a prohibited personnel practice when it takes an adverse action against a tenured federal employee without affording the employee minimum due process, OSC's theory does fall within the range of rationality. The procedures set out in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) can be interpreted as giving effect to the part of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2) that requires respect for the constitutional rights of employees when personnel actions are taken. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 241-43 (1979) (for purposes of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), a portion of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, that gives "practical effect" to a merit system principle "implements" that principle), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Gende v. Department of Justice</span>, 23 MSPR 604 (1984). Under the circumstances I defer to OSC's judgment that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the agency has committed a prohibited personnel practice. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Price v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051720398f3d132211581">398 F.3d 1322</a>, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005), involving review of a counsel fee petition, declined to equate a due process violation inherent in a noticeless suspension with a prohibited personnel practice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Price argues that by finding that SSA violated her right to due process, Chief Administrative Law Judge Streb necessarily found that SSA committed a prohibited personnel practice. She relies on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12) (2000), which defines a prohibited personnel practice to include taking any personnel action that violates any of "the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." Section 2301, in turn, defines merit systems principles to include the principle that "[a]ll employees should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management...with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2) (2000). Thus, she argues that the denial of a due process hearing necessarily constitutes a prohibited personnel practice. She further points out that the Board's attorney fee statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), specifically refers to a case in which a prohibited personnel practice was committed and thus calls for an award of fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If accepted, Ms. Price's argument would mean that any denial of a due process hearing would give rise to an automatic right to an attorney fee award, which would be contrary to the highly discretionary and fact-specific nature of the Board's attorney fee determinations. Even if Ms. Price is right that a due process violation necessarily results in a prohibited personnel practice, we do not agree that the Board is deprived of its discretion over attorney fees in any case in which a due process hearing is improperly denied. That is particularly true in a case such as this one in which, as Administrative Law Judge Hermele acknowledged, the question whether a pre-suspension hearing was required was "novel" and the suspension "had some merit and was founded on some reasonable legal basis." <span class="Italic">Addendum Decision</span>, slip op. at 4. We therefore do not agree with Ms. Price that the first factor requires an award of attorney fees in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">In Special Counsel ex rel. Exzabe v. Dept. of Army</span>, CB-1208-22-0013-U-1 (NP 5/23/2022), on a stay application, MSPB Member Leavitt considered but did not decide if a due process violation in a possible personnel action was a prohibited personnel practice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), it is a prohibited personnel practice to "take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title." One of the merit system principles states that "[a]ll employees and applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management...with proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). Thus, OSC contends that the proposed removal, <span class="Italic">if taken</span>, would constitute a prohibited personnel practice because it would violate Mr. Exzabe's constitutional due process rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC's stay request thus presents the issue of whether an agency action that violates an employee's constitutional rights is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12). I need not reach this issue, however, because the disciplinary process is ongoing, and it would be premature under the facts and circumstances of this case to find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a due process violation is likely to occur.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process is a flexible concept that calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gajdos v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 361, &#x00B6; 18 (2014); <span class="Italic">Buelna v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 16 (2014). At its core, due process requires that "an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing <span class="Italic">before</span> he is deprived of any significant property interest." <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985) (emphasis in original). This requires notice and a "meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker" before the personnel action is effected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542-43; <span class="Italic">see Hodges v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 6 (2012). Thus, the Board has held that an employee has a due process right to notice of the grounds in support of the adverse action and a meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with the authority to select an alternative outcome, to the extent an alternative penalty may have been feasible. <span class="Italic">See Grimes v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7 (2014); <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, because the removal process has been ongoing since August 18, 2021, it is purely speculative whether a due process violation will occur. To so speculate, would, in essence, amount to an improper advisory opinion regarding whether the Department of the Army could properly remove Mr. Exzabe under the circumstances presented or whether to do so would violate his due process rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (prohibiting the Board from issuing advisory opinions); <span class="Italic">Winston v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (noting that the Board does not have the authority to advise an agency concerning the removal of an employee, but only to review an agency's decision to take such action).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), proscribing "any other personnel action if the taking or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles," <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or (b)(9), under which merely <span class="Italic">proposing</span> a retaliatory personnel action may be prohibited as "threaten[ing] to take...[such] a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McDonnell v. USDA</span>, 108 MSPR 443, 448-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, 2008 MSPB 65 (2008), determined that an employee who reported that a supervisor gave an unauthorized preference in the form of a reassignment to another employee stated a violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), and that the report also implicated 5 USC 2302(b)(12) because the law, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), implicated or directly concerned the merit system principles in 5 USC 2301 prohibiting personal favoritism and providing that recruitment should be from qualified individuals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Costello</span>, 75 MSPR 562, 612-14 (1997), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Costello v. MSPB</span>, 182 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999), decided that a supervisor, an official of an agency IG office, retaliated against a subordinate who made protected disclosures. The Board considered, but did not sharply define, how the Inspector General Act might support an OSC proceeding (or affirmative defense or IRA appeal) through 5 USC 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count Two alleges that the previously discussed personnel actions which the respondents took or failed to take violated the antireprisal provision of the Inspector General Act (IG Act), 5 USC app. 3, &#x00A7; 7(c), and that the violation establishes a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(11). The Act protects from reprisal employees who make complaints or disclose information to an Inspector General, unless the complaint was made or the information <span id="Page_3752"></span>was disclosed with knowledge that it was false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity. To be protected the information must concern the "possible existence of an activity constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety." While the kinds of information protected by the Act are similar to those protected by 5 USC 2302(b)(8), it was the intent of Congress that the protections provided by the IG Act be broader, and indeed the statute contains no reasonableness requirement, does not limit covered disclosures of mismanagement to gross mismanagement and does not limit the taking of an action to personnel actions as defined in 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC app. 3, &#x00A7; 7(a). Nevertheless, as we have already found that McClintock's and Steen's disclosures were protected under the more stringent test of 5 USC 2302(b)(8), the lower standard has no effect on the status of the disclosures. The remaining issue in Count Two is whether OSC has established that reprisal under the IG Act occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Steen we have already shown that OSC met its burden to show that protected disclosures were a significant factor in Costello's decisions to reassign Steen to Los Angeles and New York and to fail to reassign him to Houston. Accordingly, OSC has shown that Costello violated the IG Act with respect to Steen. However, we need not make a further determination of whether Costello violated 5 USC 2302(b)(11) when he took the described actions because we would not impose a greater penalty for a violation based on the same set of facts. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Mongan</span>, 33 MSPR 392, 398 (1987) (the existence of more than one legal basis for a challenge to a respondent's conduct does not justify imposition of a greater penalty than would be imposed if only one legal basis existed).</p>
