<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-94"><span class="space">1.</span> Early Law From Courts</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board inherited a line of decisions from the courts that reviewed civil service appeals before the 1978 Reform Act. Some decisions involved constitutional interpretation; others evaluated adherence to statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of procedural fairness and honesty of purpose was addressed by the Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Gadsden v. United States</span>, 78 F. Supp. 126, 127 (Ct. Cl. 1948), declaring as to the Veterans Preference Act provision precluding dismissal except to promote service efficiency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[i]f the administrative officer did not act in good faith, if he in fact did not discharge the employee for a cause that would promote the efficiency of the service, but if, on the other hand, he was motivated alone by malice toward the employee, there would seem to be little doubt that the employee's rights under the Act of 1912 have been violated.... If, as a matter of fact, he was removed not for a cause that promoted the efficiency of the service, but maliciously, merely because his superior did not like him, or merely because he wanted his job for some friend of his, then obviously the employee's discharge was wrongful and illegal and, therefore, he is entitled to recover whatever loss he may have suffered thereby.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In innumerable cases it has been held that where discretion is conferred on an administrative officer to render a decision, this decision must be honestly rendered, and that if it is arbitrary or capricious, or rendered in bad faith, the courts have power to review it and set it aside....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Camero v. United States,</span> 375 F.2d 777, 778-82 (Ct. Cl. 1967), considered the impact of an attorney who defended the agency in an adversary process involving Camero through participation in a grievance hearing proceeding involving Camero's removal and whose adversarial role continued, on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis, during subsequent consideration by the agency of Camero's removal after the grievance proceeding. The decision did not precisely define the permissible involvement of agency counsel in the advisory process, but it raised questions as to the legitimacy of agency counsel being involved in the advisory process if agency counsel was earlier involved in an adversarial-type proceeding with the employee involving the subject matter of the later removal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Camero</span> produced a majority, a concurring, and a dissenting opinion, reproduced below to illustrate the early (and continuing) lack of consensus on the parameters of permissible internal agency communications in the adverse action decisional process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts involved in reaching the above decision are as follows: On May 29, 1959, plaintiff, after he had been notified of his proposed removal and had replied thereto, was separated from his position on charges of bribery, false and fraudulent travel vouchers, and undue familiarity with Government contractors. At that time he was also informed of his right to seek review under the Army grievance procedures and of his right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff chose to pursue the remedies provided by the grievance procedures and pursuant thereto duly protested his removal. A hearing was held before the Grievance Committee of the Quarter-master Depot. At the hearing, plaintiff was represented by counsel and the Agency was represented by Mr. Kostos. Witnesses were called and testified on direct and cross-examination, exhibits were received in evidence, and counsel for both parties made summary arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 2, 1959, the Grievance Committee filed its report with the depot commander, Maj. Gen. Webster Anderson. In this report, for reasons not relevant to the case in its present posture, the Committee recommended, among other things, that the removal action against plaintiff be revoked and that he be reinstated to the position and grade he held at the time of his dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before any action was taken on the Grievance Committee's recommendation, but after it had been filed with General Anderson, the General Counsel of the Agency, Donnell K. Wolverton, prepared and submitted a legal opinion to General Anderson in which he stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After a complete and diligent analysis of all the facts and applicable laws, it is my considered opinion that the grievance of Frank Camero resulting from his separation for cause by this Agency should be denied, notwithstanding the recommendation of the Agency's Grievance Committee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, General Anderson reached a decision to sustain the removal and so informed plaintiff by letter dated December 30, 1959.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the case was before the court on cross-motions for summary judgment, plaintiff contended that his dismissal was invalidated by certain alleged activities on the part of Theodore M. Kostos, the attorney who had represented the Agency before the Grievance Committee. These activities, according to plaintiff, involved <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between Kostos and those participating in the ultimate decision to sustain his removal, as well as actual participation by Kostos in that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis for the assertion that Kostos had actually participated in the removal decision was the appearance of his hand-written initials in the right margin of the final page of the office copy of General Anderson's decision letter rejecting plaintiff's grievance and a statement by Donnell K. Wolverton (in an affidavit dated June 3, 1963) that the General's letter "was coordinated" with Kostos, among others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the proceeding before the trial commissioner, it developed that the inference which plaintiff desired the court to draw from the existence of Kostos' initials on the copy of the decision letter and Wolverton's statement that the letter "was coordinated" with Kostos was not supported by the evidence. It seems that there was in effect at the time a procedure of routing through various offices of the Agency, including the General Counsel's office, material or letters prepared for the commanding general's signature. As evidence that the document had passed through a particular office, an official thereof would initial it. This official (in the General Counsel's office) was the senior official in the office at the time. On the particular day that the letter rejecting plaintiff's grievance was routed through the General Counsel's office, Kostos was the senior official present and he therefore initialed the letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The procedure of routing and initialing was loosely referred to by the Agency personnel as "coordinating." This coordinating, according to Kostos' unrebutted testimony on the point, did not necessarily reflect a review of substance of the material routed. It was apparently a procedure designed to keep the various offices informed of what was leaving the Agency over the commanding officer's signature. Thus, when Wolverton stated that the decision to reject plaintiff's grievance "was coordinated" with Kostos, among others, he was simply referring to the fact that the letter had been routed through the required offices of the Agency and had been initialed by Kostos as evidence that it had passed through the General Counsel's office before it was to be sent to General Anderson for signature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, both Kostos and General Anderson testified that he (Kostos) did not have anything to do with the actual decision to sustain plaintiff's removal or the preparation of the letter so informing plaintiff. It seems that that decision had been reached independently by Anderson after he had consulted with both Arthur Jones, chief of the Industrial Relations office, and Donnell K. Wolverton and after he had reviewed the report of the Grievance Committee (and probably, although he had no independent recollection of it, the legal opinion of Wolverton). After reaching this decision, Anderson directed the Industrial Relations office to prepare a letter to so inform plaintiff. The letter was ultimately prepared by Pat T. McNamara, a member of the staff of the Industrial Relations office. And, according to Anderson, he had relied exclusively on the Industrial Relations office, and therefore on McNamara, for the preparation of an accurate and competent letter and, in all probability, would have signed it even if it had not borne the initials of a member of the office of General Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3243"></span>Thus, as inadvisable as it may have been for Kostos to initial the office copy of the decision letter and as confusing as Wolverton's statement was that the letter "was coordinated" with Kostos, the evidence clearly shows that Kostos did not in fact participate in the actual decision nor did he have anything to do with the actual preparation of the letter to so inform plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's other assertion--that Kostos engaged in <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with those participating in the decision to sustain his removal--unlike the allegation of actual participation in the decision, was amply supported by the evidence adduced at the trial proceedings, and it is for Kostos' activities in this regard that we hold plaintiff's removal to be invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's present counsel first became aware of these <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> activities at a conference with Donnell K. Wolverton on April 24, 1964. Thereafter, on May 8, 1964, Wolverton, in response to a request to confirm his statements of April 24, 1964, addressed a letter to plaintiff's counsel wherein he stated his belief that "* * * the opinion [i. e., the legal opinion to General Anderson recommending denial of plaintiff's grievance] was either prepared by Mr. Kostos or that Mr. Kostos participated in its preparation." At the trial, Wolverton testified, in explanation of this letter, that prior to preparing his legal opinion for General Anderson but after the Grievance Committee report had been submitted, he had questioned approximately half a dozen attorneys in the General Counsel's office, including Kostos, as to their opinion of plaintiff's case. After listening to and discussing with each attorney his views on the case, Wolverton stated that he formed his own opinion which was then embodied in the legal opinion for General Anderson. Kostos corroborated Wolverton's testimony on this point when he admitted that Wolverton had solicited information from him regarding plaintiff's case and that he had thus participated in the preparation of the legal opinion to the extent that the information elicited from him was used in preparing that document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no doubt that Wolverton formed his own opinion on what recommendations he should make to General Anderson, just as we have no doubt that General Anderson made up his own mind when he decided to sustain plaintiff's removal. The problem is, however, that both decisions were made, at least in part, on the basis of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication of the opinion of Kostos, who certainly, albeit perhaps not consciously, had as an adversary more than a neutral stake in the final outcome of plaintiff's case. This is enough to require us to invalidate plaintiff's removal as being in violation of the regulations governing the Army grievance proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent regulations (Army Civilian Personnel Regulations E 2 (March 1956), hereinafter referred to as CPR E 2) provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * the resolution of employee grievances is an integral part of the installation commander's responsibility. This function may not be delegated. However, to relieve commanders of the burden of hearing all grievances personally, grievance committees will be established at the installation level to make findings of fact, hear and evaluate evidence, and make recommendations to the commander as to appropriate disposition of individual cases. Grievance committee determinations are advisory, constituting privileged staff guidance to the commander. [C PR E 2 &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3-1.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After granting this hearing-type remedy to employees, the regulations go on to provide specific procedures for the conduct of hearings (CPR E 2 &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5-1, 5-2). The net effect is to grant to an employee, when his grievance arises out of adverse Agency action, an adversary-type, evidentiary hearing where the Agency representative acts in a capacity similar to a prosecuting attorney in a criminal trial and the employee's representative acts like a defense attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Failure by the Agency to observe these procedures or the standards of fairness implicit therein makes the attempted unfavorable resolution of an employee's grievance abortive and of no effect. <span class="Italic">Cf. Vitarelli v. Seaton,</span> 359 U.S. 535, 79 S. Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed.2d 1012 (1959); <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles,</span> 354 U.S. 363, 77 S. Ct. 1152, 1 L. Ed.2d 1403 (1957). Of course, one of the fundamental premises inherent in the concept of an adversary hearing, particularly if it is of the evidentiary type, is that neither adversary be permitted to engage in an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication concerning the merits of the case with those responsible for the decision. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Canon 17, ABA Canons of Judicial Ethics; Administrative Procedure Act &#x00A7; 5(c), 60 Stat. 240, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1004(c) (1964); <span class="Italic">Sangamon Valley Television Corp. v. United States,</span> 106 U.S. App.D.C. 30, 269 F.2d 221 (1959). It is difficult to imagine a more serious incursion on fairness than to permit the representative of one of the parties to privately communicate his recommendations to the decision makers. To allow such activity would be to render the hearing virtually meaningless. We are of the opinion that due process forbids it. <span class="Italic">See Vitarelli v. Seaton,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles,</span> <span class="Italic">supra.</span> Thus, we hold that the regulations governing the Army grievance proceedings, since they grant to employees a hearing-type remedy in the process of resolution of their grievances, must be taken to incorporate this fundamental premise of fairness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, plaintiff is entitled to recover back pay from the date of his wrongful removal to the date of judgment, less any salary he may have received during the period from other employment. Judgment is entered to that effect. The amount of recovery will be determined pursuant to Rule 47(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DAVIS, Judge (concurring):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I join in the result and in the second half of the court's opinion discussing <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. I do not concur in the first half because I am not willing, even if one accepts the trial testimony at face value and discounts the agency's pre-trial statements that Mr. Kostos either prepared or participated in the preparation of the general counsel's memorandum, to say that Mr. Kostos' activity fell short of participation in the actual process of decision. The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications which the court finds that he made would seem to amount to such intervention--there is no real separation in this case between the charge of participation in the decision and the charge of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. In view of the disposition of the case, the matter is now academic but I do not want to appear to agree to the narrow definition the court apparently gives to the concept of "participation in the actual decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SKELTON, Judge, joins in the foregoing concurring opinion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">NICHOLS, Judge (dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 752.101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>; 754.101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, 771.201 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (Supp. 1966), an overhauling of the adverse actions, grievances and appeal procedure, for civilian employees, adopted in 1963. For some little time before there had been an uneasy sensation that constitutional and statutory support for some customary and usual procedures might be lacking. Loyalty and security cases had monopolized the spotlight, leading to a neglect to keep abreast of the times in other more routine adverse action cases. Since 1963, there has been no excuse for anything short of the most meticulous due process in that area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But I doubt very much whether in 1959, the date of the action here involved, there was a complete separation of prosecution and adjudication in employee adverse action cases. If there is not this clear separation, those having functions of the two kinds may not fully appreciate they are not supposed to talk to each other. Indeed, the whole concept that such conversations are objectionable <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications seems of doubtful application. In a field installation, prosecuting and adjudicating employee adverse actions are not full time jobs, and usually do not take even a major portion of anyone's efforts. It is a little hard to expect people who work together constantly with respect to most of their duties to wall themselves off with respect to a kind of work which is to them unusual and unfamiliar. For these reasons, a proper conformity with the standards the court so eloquently stresses most likely would have required clear, written directives from headquarters, and in many cases, temporary loan of experienced personnel from outside. I find it, therefore, a little hard to imply from a regulation calling just for a hearing, a commitment that the General shall not talk to Mr. Kostos. It ought to be construed as those who used it would have naturally interpreted it at the time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hence, I think all the indignation, the references to the ABA Code of Ethics and the Administrative Procedures Act, are misplaced. It is conceded that plaintiff, a nonveteran, was not in 1959 entitled to any procedure at all except as the regulation accorded it; absent its strained construction of the regulation, the court has no basis to say the General's action, or Mr. Kostos,' however reprehensible, deprived him of any legal right. And there is nothing to show the General was not capable of evaluating Mr. Kostos' natural bias as prosecutor and discounting anything he might say. It has not been my experience that the views of civilian lawyers have exactly overpowering weight with Generals. Nor is there anything to show he would have refused to receive an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication from the other side, if proffered. We are imposing sophisticated techniques on a relatively primitive procedure which, for all we know, had its own due process and was not fundamentally unfair.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If predisposition or direction robs line deciding officials of their discretion, a case can be made for harmful error. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. United States</span>, 5 Cl. Ct. 130, 135 (1984), the deciding official determined to fire an employee on the basis of fear that if he did not, "his own head would probably roll." This, the court concluded, was a serious abuse of discretion requiring that the penalty be set aside:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It surely must be a minimum requirement in the government service that the official who exercises the power of determining the penalty to be assessed in a disciplinary case should do so on the basis of a fair and objective evaluation of all the pertinent factors, and without being influenced by "fear or favor" based on the supposed attitude of his superiors.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson</span> determined that the employee may have been responsible for misconduct (falsification of jury leave records), but that he would have to be reinstated subject to the right of the employer to have another deciding official determine the penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grover v. United States,</span> 200 Ct. Cl. 337 (1973), presented the situation of a deciding official obtaining a statement from an individual accused of <span id="Page_3244"></span>wrongdoing during the employee's adverse action reply. <span class="Italic">Grover</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Camero</span> as involving an adversary-type proceeding rather than a reply session involving information from a person who was an adversary to the employee. In <span class="Italic">Grover,</span> the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statement taken by the reply officer from the employee's supervisor, who the appellant accused of being hostile to the employee. <span class="Italic">Grover</span> examined the nature of the process rather than the character of information and concluded there was no harm in the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> receipt of the statement by the reply officer from the supervisor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs second alleged procedural defect stems from the fact that after the reply proceeding was over, Mr. Duehay, the reply officer, summoned the plaintiffs superior, Mr. Guba, and received a statement from him without allowing plaintiff to be present or to cross-examine Mr. Guba at that time. The plaintiff contends that the taking of this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statement was a violation of procedural due process. For this proposition, plaintiff cites <span class="Italic">Jarett v. United States,</span> 195 Ct. Cl. 320, 451 F. 2d 623 (1971), and <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States,</span> 170 Ct. Cl. 490, 345 F. 2d 798 (1965), 179 Ct. Cl. 520, 375 F. 2d 777 (1967). Both <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and <span class="Italic">Jarett</span> involved regulations which called for evidentiary-type hearings. The oral reply proceeding is not an evidentiary hearing. It is designed to give the employee a chance to present his case on the merits or by means of confession and avoidance to a responsible agency official before a final decision has been made. It allows the employee to plead the equities of his case, since ""bureaucratic superiors, like other human beings, are susceptible to the effects of personal appeals." <span class="Italic">Washington v. United States,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> 137 Ct. Cl. at 350, 147. F. Supp. at 288. This view of the oral reply procedure is set out explicitly in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.202(b) (1968):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">*** The right to answer personally includes the right to answer orally in person by being given a reasonable opportunity to make any representations which the employee believes might sway the final decision on his case, <span class="Italic">but does not include the right to a trial or formal hearing with examination of witnesses.</span> [Emphasis supplied.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In direct contrast is the description of the hearing procedure involved in <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States, supra,</span> in which the parties were likened to the litigants in a criminal proceeding for plaintiff had been removed on bribery charges, among others. To permit the decision-maker in <span class="Italic">Camero</span> to use <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statements would have destroyed the impartiality of the hearing officer and the fundamental fairness of the proceeding. The roles played by the hearing officer in <span class="Italic">Camero</span> and the oral reply officer in this case are considerably different. The first acted as a trier of fact after an adverse decision had been made, while the latter represented the decision-maker in order to hear offerings of extenuating circumstances before the final decision was made. From the record it does not appear that any side other than the plaintiffs was actively represented at the reply proceeding. Since plaintiff made accusations of personal animosity between himself and Mr. Guba as part of his presentation, it would seem natural that the reply officer would obtain a statement from Mr. Guba in order to make an intelligent recommendation. Plaintiff did not have a chance to cross-examine his superior when the statement was given, but neither was plaintiff subjected to cross-examination during his presentation. Given the nature of the oral reply proceeding described above, it does not appear that the taking of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statement by the reply officer violated plaintiffs right to procedural due process under the circumstances here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is closely similar to <span class="Italic">Salter v. United States,</span> 188 Ct. C1. 524, 412 F.2d 874 1969), where plaintiff, also an IRS employee, was discharged but complained that after his hearing at the Regional level an affidavit of his former superior was received and considered concerning his job performance. Plaintiff challenged this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication as a denial of due process. The Civil Service Commission BAR considered this challenge and stated, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">*** it is well established in administrative proceedings of this nature that such evidence is admissible and shall be given such weight as in the Board's opinion it deserves. [188 Ct. Cl. at 530, 412 F.2d at 878.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was no showing that this procedure was a violation of any agency regulations nor is there such a showing here. The BAR also noted that there was a delay of 8 months between the submission of the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> statement and final decision by the Regional Office in Salter. During this time plaintiff did not raise any challenge to it. It is not clear from the record in the instant case just when plaintiff learned about Mr. Guba's statement to Mr. Duehay but it appears that this statement made in 1967 was first challenged by plaintiffs brief and motion filed in this case on February 1, 1972.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grover</span> was overruled as to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts by <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Depte v. United States</span>, 715 F.2d 1481, 1484-85 (Fed. Cir. 1983), concluded that there was no constitutional infirmity, and no other legal prohibition, against discussion between the deciding official in an adverse action and a critical witness to the events leading to the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another of petitioner's points is that the deciding official of the Veterans Administration, before determining Mrs. Depte's case, improperly had an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> discussion with another police officer (Sterner) who was nearby at the time of petitioner's incident with Officer Mango. The <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> nature of this interview is said to invalidate the employing agency's proceedings and thereby to bar the imposition of any sanction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, petitioner was not constitutionally entitled, at the agency stage, to confront the witnesses against her, but merely to those procedures mandated by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy,</span> 416 U.S. 134, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 40 L. Ed.2d 15 (1974); <span class="Italic">Giles v. United States,</span> 553 F.2d 647, 649 (Ct. Cl. 1977). Here, no statute (including the Civil Service Reform Act) and no regulation required an evidentiary hearing at the agency level or prohibited (at that stage) <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with witnesses to an incident of this type. It is settled that the right to make a written and oral reply (which petitioner received) did not call for such a hearing nor did it preclude the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> discussion undertaken by the agency. <span class="Italic">Grover v. United States,</span> 200 Ct. Cl. 337, 349-51 (1973), expressly so held. Mrs. Depte later had a full evidentiary hearing (at which Sterner and the agency's deciding official both testified and were subject to cross-examination) before the presiding official of the MSPB. That was adequate under the Constitution, the statute, and the regulations applicable to this case. The prior proceedings at the agency stage were not unlawful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner relies on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(2), a part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, as showing that the deciding official's discussion with Sterner was prohibited. We are told that, in giving his recollection of the altercation with Officer Mango, Sterner did not talk to the deciding official about any matter allowed to be discussed under subsections (A) or (B) of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(2), fn. 7, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The short answer is that that provision does not apply to employees of the agency who witnessed or were involved in an incident such as this, but rather relates to statements or recommendations by outsiders, like senators or congressmen; the legislative objective was to forestall political or partisan interference in personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> S.Rpt. No. 95-569, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 20, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News 2723, 2742. It would indeed be amazing if, without saying so, Congress had absolutely prohibited--as &#x00A7; 2302(b)(2) does in those situations to which it applies--a deciding official from interviewing (even with the accused employee present) another employee who was an eyewitness to the incident. We conclude rather, that the Civil Service Reform Act did not change the pre-existing law in this respect and that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> interview with Sterner was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Depte</span>, like <span class="Italic">Grover</span>, was overruled as to <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> contacts by <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Della Valle v. United States,</span> 231 Ct. Cl. 818 (1982), distinguished adversarial from advisory communications, the latter group constitutionally unobjectionable in agency consideration of adverse personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff replied orally to these charges on September 2, 1977, to Rear Admiral Cyril Faulders, Jr., who ultimately made a recommendation for removal. This recommendation was put in plaintiffs file but was not furnished to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff declined the option of another psychiatric examination. Dr. Ventry was then requested to make a recommendation concerning plaintiffs fitness, which he did, concluding that plaintiff was fit. This recommendation was not given to plaintiff.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final agency decision of removal was made on November 4, 1977, and that decision was affirmed by the MSPB on August 6, 1979. Plaintiff filed in this court on June 10, 1980.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff complains: (1) that his removal violated due process because it was based in part on "<span class="Italic">ex parte</span>" communications, i.e., the recommendations from Faulders and Ventry;...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the allegation of a due process violation, defendant responds that the recommendations from Faulders and Ventry are not of the type of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that this court found offensive to due process in <span class="Italic">Camero v. United States,</span> 179 Ct. Cl. 520&#x007E; 375 F.2d 777 (1967), because they are not communications to the decision-maker from an adversary. The Faulders and Ventry communications merely were internal documents of an advisory nature. Plaintiff refers this court, however, to <span class="Italic">Ralpho v. Bell,</span> 569 F.2d 607 (D.C. Cir. 1977), in which a due process violation was found where there was no adversarial communication-where an agency simply did not furnish a claimant with an investigatory report on which it was going to place principal reliance in time for him to challenge it. We conclude, though, that <span class="Italic">Ralpho v. Bell</span> does not apply. There is a great difference between screening a claimant from virtually all information concerning his claim, as happened in <span class="Italic">Ralpho v. Bell,</span> and allowing a decision-maker to call for advice in making his decision, as happened in the present case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have before us nothing more than an example of permissible institutional decision-making. Further, plaintiff here had adequate written notice of the charges against him and did reply thereto.</p>
