<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-211"><span class="space">a.</span> Authority to Direct Promotion and Award Back Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">Awards enforcing contract provisions requiring temporary promotions do not affect management's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">VA, Ralph H. Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-052.html">56 FLRA 381</a>, 386-87 (2000), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 57 FLRA 72 (2001). It is "well established" that if an agency's violation of a collective bargaining agreement results in the denial of a temporary promotion that the grievant would have otherwise secured under the contract, an arbitrator may, consistent with law and regulations, award a noncompetitive temporary promotion with back pay to that grievant. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 44 FLRA 147, 152 (1992) (also noting that negotiated agreements, rather than agency regulations, govern disposition of matters within scope of both); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater FEMTC</span>, 55 FLRA 1014, 1016 n.6 (1999) ("[The] Authority has uniformly refused to allow the competitive promotion requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(iii) to excuse an agency's failure to temporarily promote a grievant as required by a collective bargaining agreement."); <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees</span>, 51 FLRA 1210, 1216-17 (1996) (if agreement incorporates agency regulations governing temporary promotions, issue before arbitrator is one of contract interpretation); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and IAM Local 2333</span>, 52 FLRA 285, 287 (1996) ("[T]he Authority has long held that grievances concerning whether a grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the duties of a higher-graded position do not concern the classification of a position, within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5).").</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator has the authority to compensate an employee through the grievance procedure for wrongful denial of enhanced pay that should have been earned through a temporary promotion, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 231 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., N.C. Region, Chicago</span>, 51 FLRA 594, 597 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, an employee is entitled only to the salary of the position to which the employee is appointed. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Polk, Louisiana and National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-168</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1563 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Cassandra McPeak and</span> <span class="Italic">Wayne E. Dabney</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 140 (1989) (<span class="Italic">McPeak</span>)). An exception to this general rule exists, permitting compensation for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher graded position, based on an agency regulation, or when the parties to a collective bargaining agreement agree to make temporary promotions mandatory for details to higher graded positions, thereby establishing a nondiscretionary agency policy which would provide a basis for backpay. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 225</span>, 49 FLRA 562, 565 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S.</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 510 (1981) and <span class="Italic">McPeak</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. at 141); <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, 44 FLRA at 1563.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 58 FLRA 498, 500 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator may properly award backpay under the Back Pay Act when the arbitrator determines that an agency has denied an employee a <span id="page_2079"></span>temporary promotion to which the employee was entitled under a collective bargaining agreement or applicable regulations for having performed the duties of a higher-graded position for an extended period of time. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Health and Human Services, Public Health Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Indian Health Service, </span>50 FLRA 383, 385 (1995). However, the Authority has consistently held that an "employee must meet the minimum qualification requirements prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management" for the higher-graded position in order to receive a temporary or permanent promotion to that position. <span class="Italic">See id. at 386. See also United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Housing and Urban Development, Louisiana State</span> <span class="Italic">Office, New Orleans, Louisiana, </span>53 FLRA 1611, 1619 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC, Allen Park and AFGE Local 933</span>, 38 FLRA 688, 697-98 (1990), explained how arbitrators are authorized to award back pay involving temporary promotion claims:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for an award of backpay to be authorized by the Back Pay Act, the arbitrator must find that an agency personnel action was unjustified or unwarranted, that the action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials, and that but for the action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction.... An agency's violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action for purposes of the Back Pay Act....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was entitled to a temporary promotion under Article 16, Section 2 of the parties' negotiated agreement. The Authority has consistently held to be negotiable, and enforceable in arbitration, agreement provisions which permit employees to receive temporary promotions when they are assigned to perform the duties of higher-graded positions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator's award, based on his interpretation of the temporary promotion procedures of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, is inconsistent with the Back Pay Act. We conclude that: (1) the grievant was subjected to an unwarranted personnel action (the failure to temporarily promote and pay her for performing higher-graded duties); (2) the action directly resulted in the reduction of her pay; and (3) but for the action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the reduction in pay....</p>
<p class="noindent">Without an independent regulatory or statutory basis (e.g., EEO) for a temporary promotion, the right to a temporary promotion should be based on contract entitlement, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2142 and Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi</span>, 51 FLRA 1140, 1142-43 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute provides that grievances concerning "the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee" are precluded by law from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure. When the substance of a grievance concerns the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by the grievant, the grievance concerns the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2025 and U.S. Department of the Air Force, Ninth Reconnaissance Wing, Beale Air Force Base California</span>, 50 FLRA 39, 42 (1994). When the substance of a grievance concerns whether the grievant is entitled to a temporary promotion under a collective bargaining agreement by reason of having performed the duties of a higher-graded position, the grievance does not concern the classification of a position within the meaning of section 7121(c)(5). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Randolph AFB</span>, on which the Arbitrator in this case relied in dismissing the grievances, the arbitrator determined that the grievant's WG-5 position required the grievant to perform WG-9 duties and ordered the agency to provide the grievant with backpay. 49 FLRA at 1390. The Authority concluded that the arbitrator had resolved the grievance by determining the grade level of the duties performed by the grievant. The Authority noted that there was no indication in the record that the grievant had challenged a failure by the Agency to promote him temporarily because he had performed higher-graded duties. Accordingly, the Authority ruled that the award pertained to the classification of the grievant's position and that, therefore, it conflicted with section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reviewing the questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, we first conclude that the Arbitrator correctly determined on the basis of <span class="Italic">Randolph AFB</span> that the grievances were precluded by section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. As in <span class="Italic">Randolph AFB</span>, the substance of the grievances concerned the grade level of the duties assigned to, and performed by, the grievants in their permanent positions and not whether they were entitled to temporary promotions under the parties' collective bargaining agreement for performing previously classified duties of higher-graded positions. Second, nothing in the equal pay principles of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101 is inconsistent with an award finding that grievances concerning the classification of a position are precluded by law under section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute from coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 47 FLRA 667, 673 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association and Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 15 FLRA 358, 359 (1984) (enforcement of equal pay principle does not prevent award from conflicting with section 7121(c)(5) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Kessler AFB and AFGE Local 2760</span>, 60 FLRA 425, 428-30 (2004), emphasized the need for a specific contractual or regulatory basis for a temporary promotion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency contends that there is no provision in the agreement that entitles the grievant to a temporary promotion based on having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position. We construe the Agency's assertion as a claim that the award of the temporary promotion is contrary to law, including the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the applicability of the Back Pay Act, the Authority has held that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, an award of backpay is authorized only where an arbitrator finds that (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Reserve Personnel Command, St. Louis,</span> <span class="Italic">Mo.</span>, 59 FLRA 455, 456 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring)<span class="Italic"> </span>(<span class="Italic">Army Reserve Personnel Command</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, an employee is entitled only to the salary of the position to which the employee is appointed. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Wapato Irrigation Project, Wapato, Wash.</span>, 57 FLRA 548, 550 (2001) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Fort Polk, </span>44 FLRA at 1563, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Cassandra G. McPeak and Wayne E. Dabney</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 140 (1989) (<span class="Italic">McPeak</span>)). An exception to this general rule exists, permitting compensation for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher-graded position, based on an agency regulation, or when the parties to a collective bargaining agreement agree to make temporary promotions mandatory for details to higher graded positions, thereby establishing a nondiscretionary agency policy which would provide a basis for backpay. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Army Armament Research, Dev. and Eng'g. Ctr.</span>, 49 FLRA 562, 565 (1994) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S.</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 510 (1981) and <span class="Italic">McPeak</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. at 140); <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, 44 FLRA at 1563.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Absent such a regulation or collective bargaining provision, the fact that a grievant performed higher-graded duties is insufficient to entitle the grievant to an award of backpay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Personnel Command, </span>59 FLRA at 456 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, 88th Air Base Wing, Aeronautical Sys. Div., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 52 FLRA 285 (1996)). Thus, where an arbitrator fails to identify a non-discretionary agency regulation or a collective bargaining agreement provision that would entitle a grievant to backpay for performing the duties of a higher-graded position, there is no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which would entitle the grievant to an award of backpay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, III Corps &#x0026; Fort Hood, Fort Hood</span>, <span class="Italic">Tex</span>., 56 FLRA 544, 546 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency asserts that there is no provision in the agreement that entitles the grievant to a temporary promotion based on having temporarily performed the duties of a higher-graded position. In awarding the temporary promotion and backpay, the Arbitrator stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Article 3(A)(1) of the [a]greement incorporates a commitment to comply with "regulations of appropriate authorities." Because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301[ ] requires <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> that there be equal pay for work of equal value, the failure to temporarily promote grievant after April 24, 2001 was a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)[(12)].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of Article 3(A)(1) demonstrates that it does not address whether employees may receive temporary promotions when they perform the duties of a higher-graded position. Thus, Article 3(A)(1), in itself, does not contain a nondiscretionary Agency policy that permits compensation for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher-graded position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's reliance on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301 and 2302(b)(12) also cannot serve as a basis for awarding the temporary promotion. Merit system principles are hortatory and are not self-executing. Because they are not self-executing and, alone, cannot form the basis of a legal action, they cannot independently authorize or serve as the basis for an arbitration remedy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</span>, 58 FLRA 333, 336 (2003) and the cases cited therein. Additionally, an arbitrator "can award relief under section 2302(b)(1[2]) for violations of merit system principles only if the arbitrator also finds a violation of a law, rule, or regulation that implements or directly concerns those merit system principles." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 336-37 (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Indian Educators Fed'n, New Mexico Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 53 FLRA 352, 360 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator here found a violation of a merit system principle set forth in &#x00A7; 2301(b), the Arbitrator did not find a violation of any law, rule, or regulation implementing or concerning those principles. <span id="page_2080"></span>Consequently, the Arbitrator erred by finding a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12). <span class="Italic">See e.g. United States Dep't of Defense, Army Chemical and Military Police Ctrs., Fort McClellan, Ala.</span>, 39 FLRA 457, 463 (1991)<span class="Italic"> </span>(arbitrator erred by finding a prohibited personnel practice under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12) because the arbitrator did not find a violation of law, rule, or regulation implementing or concerning merit system principles).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also relied on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 335.102(f), 300.602, and 316.401. However, these provisions do not implement a mandate of law or other outside authority which is essentially nondiscretionary. For instance, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102(f) gives an agency authority to make time-limited promotions to fill temporary positions, but this provision does not mandate that an agency grant an employee a temporary promotion. Also, the Arbitrator did not identify any provision in AFMAN 36-203, Chpt. 2.20 that establishes a nondiscretionary agency policy mandating a temporary promotion, nor did the Union specify any wording in the regulation that it relied on to support its position. The Union provided only an internet citation to an Air Force regulation dated December 12, 2002, rather than a copy of the regulation. Therefore, there is nothing in the record that establishes that either the contract article or regulations, relied on by the Arbitrator or the Union to support the granting of a temporary promotion, set forth a nondiscretionary agency policy that mandates a temporary promotion for the performance of duties of a higher-graded position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, nothing in the agreement nor any of the regulations relied on by the Arbitrator or cited by the Union mandate that the Agency grant the grievant a temporary promotion. Because the Arbitrator has not identified or relied on a non-discretionary policy mandating a temporary promotion, the award of backpay to the grievant is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act and, therefore, the award must be set aside. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Personnel Command, </span>59 FLRA at 456.</p>
<p class="noindent">Entitlement to temporary promotion may rest on a combination of contractual and regulatory requirements. An exception to the general rule that an employee is entitled only to the salary of the position he actually fills is "where the parties to a collective bargaining agreement agree to make temporary promotions mandatory for details to higher-grade positions, thereby establishing a nondiscretionary agency policy" providing a basis for back pay. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 38 FLRA 32, 36 (1990), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">McPeak and Dabney</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 93, 94 (1989). As a result, contract provisions entitling employees to temporary promotions are enforceable either when employees are detailed to the higher-graded position or when the employees are assigned or directed to perform the duties of the higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Polk and NAGE Local R5-168</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1563-64 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 37 FLRA 1144, 1148 (1990) ("The Authority has consistently held to be...enforceable in arbitration, agreement provisions which permit employees to receive temporary promotions when they are assigned to perform the duties of higher-graded positions."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1617 and Dept. of Air Force, Kelly AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1648-49 (1996) (acknowledging rule, but arbitrator found that the employee was not entitled to higher pay because she did not perform higher-graded duties).</p>
<p class="noindent">Contractual or regulatory entitlement to temporary promotions was also explained in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Armament Research Dev. and Eng'g Ctr. and AFGE Local 225</span>, 49 FLRA 562, 565 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the contention of the Union, the Arbitrator correctly ruled that an award of compensation for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher-graded position must be based on a nondiscretionary provision of the Agency's regulations or the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Supply Center</span>, <span class="Italic">Norfolk, Virginia and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Lodge 97</span>, 38 FLRA 448, 452 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S.</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 510 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Wilson</span>) and the Comptroller General's decision in <span class="Italic">McPeak</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 140 (1989)). Furthermore, the court in <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> and the Authority, based on the court's decision, have specifically held that the detail provisions in FPM chapter 300 do not entitle an employee to a retroactive temporary promotion with backpay in circumstances where the employee has performed the duties of a higher-graded position for more than 120 days. 229 Ct. Cl. at 512-13; <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee and American Federation of Government Employees, Local No. 2400</span>, 19 FLRA 325, 326 (1985). Thus, without regard to the fact that the cited provision of FPM chapter 300 has been abolished as a result of the sunset of the FPM, which precludes the Union's reliance on that provision in its exception to the award, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Center, St. Louis</span>, <span class="Italic">Missouri and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 900</span>, 49 FLRA No. 14 (1994), the Union provides no basis for finding that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to the FPM. Accordingly, we will deny the Union's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The significance of a nondiscretionary source of authority to establish back pay entitlement for a temporary promotion was reemphasized in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and IAM Local 2333</span>, 52 FLRA 285, 288-89 (1996). <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Foods Inspection Locals</span>, 65 FLRA 417, 419-20 (2011), addressed the nondiscretionary obligation to temporarily promote an individual (in the award reviewed, under a contract) and the limitation on a noncompetitive promotion (not more than 120 days):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general rule, an employee is entitled only to the salary of the position to which the employee is appointed. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Fort Polk</span>, <span class="Italic">La.</span>, 44 FLRA 1548, 1563 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Cassandra G. McPeak and Wayne E. Dabney</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 140 (1989) (<span class="Italic">McPeak</span>)). An exception to this general rule exists, permitting compensation for the temporary performance of the duties of a higher-graded position, where, as relevant here, a collective bargaining agreement makes temporary promotions mandatory for details to higher graded positions, thereby establishing a nondiscretionary agency policy that would provide a basis for backpay. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Armament Research, Dev. &#x0026; Eng'g. Ctr</span>., 49 FLRA 562, 565 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. United States</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 510 (1981); <span class="Italic">McPeak</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. at 140); <span class="Italic">Fort Polk</span>, 44 FLRA at 1563. Where an arbitrator fails to identify such a non-discretionary agency policy, there is no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that would entitle the grievant to an award of backpay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 81st Training Wing, Keesler Air Force Base, Miss.</span>, 60 FLRA 425, 429 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, III Corps &#x0026; Fort Hood, Fort Hood, Tex</span>., 56 FLRA 544, 546 (2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that Article 21, Section 8 is the only relevant provision in the parties' agreement, and that the grievant is not entitled to backpay under that provision because the Arbitrator failed to find that the grievant was detailed for more than sixty consecutive days. The Agency's argument effectively restates the Agency's essence exception, which we have denied. Accordingly, the Agency provides no basis for finding the award contrary to the Back Pay Act, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c) </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c) because the Arbitrator directed the Agency to grant a temporary promotion without the use of competitive procedures for a period spanning seven months, and therefore, in excess of 120 days. The Agency also contends that the award conflicts with the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Johnson Med. Ctr</span>, 60 FLRA 46<span class="Italic">. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) mandates the use of competitive procedures for promotions to higher-graded positions that last "more than 120 days[.]" Consistent with this regulation, the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Johnson Med. Ctr. </span>that an award of a retroactive temporary promotion for a period of over two years violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i). 60 FLRA at 49-50.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that "the number of days detailed amount[ed] to less than 120 days" and that the Agency must "pay [the g]rievant for each day [that] he was detailed[.]" In this regard, there is no dispute that the grievant was detailed twice a week during the relevant period. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Johnson Med. Ctr. </span>or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i) precludes an agency from noncompetitively, temporarily promoting a grievant for a series of time periods (here, twice a week), even if that series of periods--when added to intermittent periods where the grievant was not temporarily promoted--exceeds 120 days. Accordingly, the Agency does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c), and we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">A violation of a past practice may warrant the award of a temporary promotion, <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters Local 13</span>, 41 FLRA 284, 290-92 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for an award of backpay to be authorized under the Back Pay Act, an arbitrator must find that an agency personnel action was unjustified or unwarranted, that the action directly resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials, and that but for the action, the grievant otherwise would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Allen Park, Michigan and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 933</span>, 38 FLRA 688 (1990). The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to the Back Pay Act because there was no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and because the Arbitrator did not make the required finding that "but for" the unwarranted personnel action, the grievants would not have suffered the withdrawal or reduction in pay. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that by unilaterally changing the past practice of filling vacant positions by promotion and by detailing employees to positions for training purposes without giving them temporary promotions, the Agency violated Article XXVI, Mid-Term Bargaining, of the parties' agreement. Violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act and the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement satisfies the requirement for an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Marion, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2483</span>, 38 FLRA 270, 274 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Medical Center, Marion</span>) (arbitrator's finding that a detail was improper under the parties' agreement constituted requisite finding <span id="page_2081"></span>under the Back Pay Act that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator found that "but for" the Agency's failure to bargain over the changes to be made in the promotion policy and the implementation of the new training policy, employees would not have been deprived of the pay to which they were entitled for filling higher level positions. The Arbitrator stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[r]educed to its basic elements, the Commission is telling the [U]nion that for a period of 2 1/2 years not only will no bargaining unit employees be promoted to fill a vacancy in a higher classification, but that those same bargaining unit employees will be detailed to perform the duties of the higher classifications. And because of the Commission's identifying such temporary promotions as training devices, the temporarily promoted individuals will not be compensated in accordance with the negotiated wage rates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's decision to change unilaterally the practice of filling vacancies by temporary promotions and instead to use details to vacancies as training devices denied affected employees compensation at higher wage rates. That finding satisfies the requirement of the Back Pay Act that the Agency's unjustified or unwarranted personnel action resulted in the reduction of pay for those employees improperly detailed to higher graded positions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator's award fails to meet the requirements of the Back Pay Act.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator determined that the record established that the grievant had performed GS-12 duties. However, the Arbitrator failed to identify any non-discretionary Agency policy set forth in an Agency regulation or a collective bargaining agreement provision which would entitle the grievant to back pay for performing the duties of a higher-graded position. As such, there was no unjust or unwarranted personnel action which would entitle the grievant to an award of back pay under the Back Pay Act. In the absence of such a finding, there is no basis to sustain an award of back pay. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of back pay to the grievant is deficient as it is contrary to the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Navajo Area Indian Health Service and Laborers' International Union of North America, Navajo Nation Health Care Employees, Local 1376</span>, 50 FLRA 383, 386 (1995).</p>
