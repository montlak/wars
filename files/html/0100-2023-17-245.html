<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-243"><span class="space">m.</span> Travel Time</h5>
<p class="noindent">OPM Travel time regulations have been changing, and readers should check those regulations when they determine the applicability of the decisions that follow. Travel time was properly denied by an arbitrator in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 236 and GSA Region 9</span>, 56 FLRA 136, 137-38 (2000), summarizing the legal standards for an award under the FEPA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general rule regarding overtime pay under the FEPA is that time outside normal duty hours spent in travel status does not constitute hours of work.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2). As one exception, FEPA provides that travel time constitutes hours of work for overtime purposes if the travel "results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv).[5] Under that subsection, compensation for overtime is authorized only where two requirements are met: (1) the travel must result from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively; and (2) there must be an immediate official necessity concerning the event that requires travel outside the employee's regular duty hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;FEPA provides three additional exceptions to the general rule regarding overtime pay for travel.... As those exceptions are not claimed to apply in this case, we do not address them further.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing subsection 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv), the Authority relies on Comptroller General and court interpretations of the statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy Naval Underseas Warfare Center, Newport,</span> <span class="Italic">Rhode Island and National Association of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers,</span> 54 FLRA 1495, 1499-500 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Barth v. United States</span>, 568 F.2d 1329, 1332 (Ct. Cl. 1978) (<span class="Italic">Barth</span>)). With respect to the first requirement, the Court of Claims and the Comptroller General define an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively as one where there is "a total lack of Government control[.]" <span class="Italic">Barth, </span>568 F.2d at 1332; <span class="Italic">Defense Security Institute Instructors</span>, 71 Comp. Gen. 228, 230 (1992). As such, if an agency "shares" control over an event with another party and exercises its control "indirectly," then travel required by that event will not meet the "narrowly drawn statutory exception[.]" <span class="Italic">Barth, </span>568 F.2d at 1332. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, and NTEU Chapter 208 and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, </span>13 FLRA 60, 62-63 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator made specific factual findings on which he based his legal conclusion that the training conferences were controlled administratively by the Agency. In particular, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the Agency was a part of the overall management of the training program; (2) the decision to hold the training Monday through Friday "was a management decision"; and (3) that decision was "the responsibility of the Agency." These factual findings, to which we defer, support the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the grievants' travel resulted from events that were administratively controllable by the Agency<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Denver, Colorado and National Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Employees, Local 1497, </span>48 FLRA 589, 593-94 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, the Arbitrator erred when he "ruled that the matter was 'administratively controllable' since travel was not in response to an emergency." However, even if the Arbitrator described the situations that would not be "administratively controllable" too narrowly, this does not affect the Arbitrator's specific finding, to which we defer, that the disputed travel in this case was administratively controllable. Accordingly, the Union's assertion does not provide a basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that provided compensation for travel time was set aside in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Coastal Sys. Station and AFGE Local 1380</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-009.html">61 FLRA 57</a>, 58-59 (2005), explaining rules governing compensation for travel time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general rule under the Federal Employees Pay Act is that time spent traveling outside regular duty hours does not constitute compensable hours of work.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 236</span>, 56 FLRA 136, 137 (2000). However, as recognized by the Arbitrator, &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv) provides an exception to the general rule. Under &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv), travel time outside of an employee's regular duty hours constitutes compensable hours of work when the travel "results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively[.]" Accordingly, the Authority will find deficient arbitration awards awarding compensation for travel time when the travel did not result from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Health Care Financing Admin.</span>, 20 FLRA 583, 584 (1985) (because the grievant's travel was scheduled and controlled by the grievant with the concurrence of the agency, the travel did not result from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively) (<span class="Italic">HCFA</span>); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE Local No. 1815</span>, 7 FLRA 421, 422 (1981) (arbitrator correctly ruled that time traveling to investigate an aircraft accident was not compensable because the agency administratively controlled which team would investigate accidents).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In construing and applying subsection iv, the Authority relies on interpretations of the courts and the Comptroller General. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Council 236</span>, 56 FLRA at 137. The Comptroller General has repeatedly ruled that even when an employee's travel time is precipitated by an uncontrollable event, the time is not compensable under subsection iv when the timing of the duties to be performed by the employee is within the administrative control of the agency or the employee. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span id="page_2144"></span>B-236,012 (Nov. 8, 1989) (following a train accident in January 1987, the agency conducted an extended rail safety inspection; employees traveled on Sundays from March through July 1987 to report to temporary duty stations on Mondays to inspect rails; travel time was not compensable because the agency controlled the scheduling of the inspections even though the accident that precipitated the inspections was not within the agency's control); <span class="Italic">Charles A. Bowsher</span>, 49 Comp. Gen. 209, 211 (1969) (travel time of employees outside their regular duty hours to repair gun shields of a ship before it sailed was not compensable because "[t]he time for scheduling of the repair was completely within the administrative control of the [agency]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has found awards deficient when travel time compensation was based on an agency's failure to make the maximum practicable effort to schedule travel to occur during regular duty hours. <span class="Italic">See HCFA; United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Corr. Inst., Danbury, Conn.</span>, 16 FLRA 811 (1984). Similarly, the Comptroller General has rejected claims that travel outside of regular duty hours should be compensable because employees were ordered to travel when they did and were not offered the option to travel during their regular duty hours. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., B-198,771 (Dec. 10, 1980). The Comptroller General emphasized that to be compensable, travel must meet one of the exceptions of &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2). Although the Comptroller General acknowledged the policy of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(b)(2),[2] the Comptroller General noted that &#x00A7; 6101(b)(2) is not authority for payment of compensation. "In other words the Congress has not provided compensation as a remedy where the circumstances of an employee's travel do not fall within the purview of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2) and where an agency fails to adhere to the policy of trying to schedule travel during regular duty hours when practicable, enunciated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(b)(2)." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 6101(b)(2) provides: "To the maximum extent practicable, the head of an agency shall schedule the time to be spent by an employee in a travel status away from his official duty station within the regularly scheduled workweek of the employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this precedent here, we conclude that the award of compensation is contrary to &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv). The Arbitrator erred by finding that the relevant event for purposes of subsection iv was the breakdown of the vems units. The relevant event for purposes of subsection iv was the repair of the vems units. The timing of the repair of the units was subject to administrative control and scheduling, even though the breakdown that precipitated the grievant's travel was not controllable. Consequently, the grievant's travel time outside his regular duty hours did not result from events that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively within the meaning of &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv), and the award finding otherwise is deficient.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">HCFA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Under &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv), return travel is compensable if outbound travel was compensable. Because the grievant's outbound travel to repair the vems units was not compensable, the grievant's return travel must independently satisfy &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv) to be compensable. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Housing and Urban Dev.</span>, 70 Comp. Gen. 77, 80 (1990). Because the return travel did not result from events that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively, it clearly does not. <span class="Italic">See Daniel L. Hubbel</span>, 68 Comp. Gen. 29, 32 (1988). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of compensation for the grievant's return travel is likewise deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument that the travel time is compensable because the grievant traveled when ordered to travel by the Agency provides no basis for supporting the award. Even if the Agency failed to meet the policy of &#x00A7; 6101(b)(2) in ordering the grievant to travel outside his regular duty time, no basis is available for compensating that travel time.

<p class="noindent-1">V. Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is set aside.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We note that effective January 28, 2005, the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act, 118 Stat. 2313, added 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5550b, entitled "Compensatory time off for travel," which provides: "Notwithstanding &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2), each hour spent by an employee in travel status away from the official duty station of the employee, that is not otherwise compensable, shall be treated as an hour of work or employment for purposes of calculating compensatory time off." Nothing in the legislation indicates that this provision was intended to apply to travel that occurred during the time periods involved in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA explained the requisites of awards of travel time, with particular reference to Wage Grade employees, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 47 FLRA 786, 788-90 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant in this case is a WG employee.&#x2003;WG employees are excluded from coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5541. Accordingly, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542, relied on by the Agency and the Arbitrator, does not apply. Instead, 5 USC 5544 expressly applies to WG employees and addresses their entitlement to overtime compensation for time spent in a travel status.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 5542 and 5544 are worded similarly.&#x2003;Moreover, as interpreted by the Comptroller General, both sections require that two conditions must be satisfied before travel during nonwork hours will qualify as hours of work for purposes of entitlement to overtime compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Benjamin Brown and John R. Schacht</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 385, 386 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Schacht</span>)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> Comp. Gen. No. B-227489, (November 30,1987) (unpublished). First, the event requiring off-duty travel must be administratively uncontrollable.[5] Second, there must be an immediate official necessity, occasioned by the administratively uncontrollable event, for the travel.[6] <span class="Italic">Schacht</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. at 386.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Comptroller General has held that, for an event to qualify as administratively uncontrollable, there must be a total lack of Government control arising from a compelling reason of an emergency nature in the scheduling of the event<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gary A. Pace</span>, 68 Comp. Gen. 229, 231 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Pace</span>) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Dr. L. Friedman</span>, 65 Comp. Gen. 772 (1986))<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> Comp. Gen. No. B-231475 (August 12, 1988) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In determining whether an immediate official necessity exists, the Comptroller General looks to the actual necessity for immediate travel, and the sense of urgency stemming from the request that assistance be provided. <span class="Italic">Pace</span>, 68 Comp. Gen. at 231. In assessing the sense of urgency, the Comptroller General noted that "[a]n emergency...is not confined to the [event] itself, but extends to all duties relating to the event." <span class="Italic">Pace</span>, 68 Comp. Gen. at 232.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two sections differ in one respect, however. In this regard, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 expressly includes return travel to an official duty station as hours of work when the initial travel results from an administratively uncontrollable event<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Dr. L. Friedman</span>, 65 Comp. Gen. 772, 774 (1986). On the other hand, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5544, as interpreted by the Comptroller General, requires that return travel must also satisfy the same two conditions in order to qualify as hours of work. That is, the event requiring nonduty return travel must be administratively uncontrollable, and there must be an immediate official necessity occasioned by the uncontrollable event in order for the travel time to qualify as hours of work. <span class="Italic">See</span> B-227489, (November 30, 1987) (unpublished). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">John B. Schepman</span>, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, 60 Comp. Gen. 681, 684 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the event necessitating the grievant's travel was "an aircraft needing repairs[,]" and that the event could not be scheduled or controlled administratively. However, the Arbitrator did not determine whether there was an official immediate necessity for the grievant to travel to Guam during his nonwork hours. Moreover, the Arbitrator did not separately address the grievant's return trip from Guam.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unable to determine from the award, and the record as a whole, whether the grievant's travel resulted from an event that was administratively uncontrollable, as interpreted by the Comptroller General, and whether there was an official immediate necessity for the grievant to travel during nonwork hours. In addition, we are unable to determine whether the award was intended to cover the grievant's return travel to his official duty station or, if it was, whether such travel also satisfied relevant requirements. Therefore, we are unable to determine whether the award is consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5544, as interpreted and applied by the Comptroller General.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As we are unable to determine whether the award is deficient, we will remand the award to the parties, who should, absent settlement, request the Arbitrator to clarify the award consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="noindent">A flexitime article did not establish a right to travel time for a union official, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 41 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 57 FLRA 640, 644-45 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The issue in this case is whether the Act or any superseding law prohibits the granting of credit hours to an employee working an alternative work schedule for time the employee has spent traveling. Although the language of the Act and its implementing regulations do not address the matter, OPM, under its authority established in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6133(b)(1), has issued guidance and advice addressing the issue. In OPM's view, employees on alternative work schedules may not earn credit hours for time spent traveling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee on an alternative work schedule can earn credit hours only for hours that he or she elects to work in addition to the employee's basic work requirement. As relevant here, OPM properly recognized that travel in connection with government work does not meet those requirements, as travel in connection with government work is not voluntary in nature. An employee cannot elect to travel in connection with government work because the employee must travel to the place where the employee is to perform his or her official duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the term "elects" refers to an election as to the timing of the performance of the work because, in the Union's view, no employee can actually elect to perform any of his or her duties. Travel, <span id="page_2145"></span>however, is fundamentally different than the performance of duties at an official duty station. In contrast to the situation where an employee is at his or her official duty station and he or she elects to extend the workday by performing additional assigned duties, an employee in travel status has no choice but to travel in connection with the performance of his or her official duties. Further, the "timing" of the travel is not always within an employee's control. Accordingly, as recognized by OPM, employees may not receive credit hours for time spent traveling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Alternatively, as the Agency argues, even if employees can be considered to "elect" to travel, the travel at issue here, which is outside the employee's basic work requirement, would not be considered "work" under the statutory definition of credit hours. While the Act does not specify when travel time is considered compensable work under a flexible schedule, that issue is addressed in the premium pay provisions of Title 5 and the FLSA. Under those provisions, travel time is considered hours of work only if it occurs within the employee's "regularly scheduled administrative workweek." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(A); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 551.421; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 551.422(a)(1). Travel time is not considered hours of work for pay purposes if it occurs outside that time period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees who work flexible schedules under the Act have a "basic work requirement" in lieu of a regularly scheduled administrative workweek. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6121(3). The basic work requirement is "the number of hours, excluding overtime hours, which an employee is required to work...<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. OPM's regulations indicate that the concept of a "basic work requirement" should be considered the same as the concept of "regularly scheduled work" for hours of duty purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, travel time within the basic work requirement would be considered compensable and travel time outside the basic work requirement would not be compensable, as it is not regularly scheduled. The Act further defines "credit hours" as "hours within a flexible schedule..., which are in excess of an employee's basic work requirement...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6121(4). As credit hours are defined as outside the basic work requirement, travel during these hours would not be compensable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Underseas Warfare Ctr. and NAGE, FUSE</span>, 54 FLRA 1495, 1499-1500 (1998), provides an example of an award that properly awarded FEPA overtime compensation for travel of an engineer to a test site operated by a government contractor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The general rule regarding overtime pay under FEPA is that time spent in a travel status away from the official-duty station of an employee does not constitute hours of work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2). As an exception, FEPA provides that time spent in a travel status constitutes hours of work for overtime purposes if the travel "results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively, including travel by an employee to such an event and the return of such employee from such event to his or her official-duty station." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv). This exception has been interpreted by the Comptroller General to authorize compensation for overtime if two elements are met:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;the travel results from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;there is an immediate official necessity concerning the event that requires travel outside the employee's regular duty hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barth v. U.S.</span>, 568 F.2d 1329, 1332 (Ct. Cl. 1978); <span class="Italic">Jordan</span>, 72 Comp. Gen. 286, 287 (1993); <span class="Italic">Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 70 Comp. Gen. 77 (1990); <span class="Italic">William A. Lewis, et. al</span>, 69 Comp. Gen. 545, 547 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first requirement, the Arbitrator set forth specific factual findings on which he based his legal conclusion that the test was not scheduled or controlled administratively by the Agency. In particular, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the event necessitating the grievant's travel away from his official duty station was the test at Lockheed Martin; (2) Lockheed Martin controlled the availability of the testing facilities and the scheduling of the tests; and (3) the Agency had no control over the scheduling of the tests. The Authority accords deference to an arbitrator's factual findings because the parties bargained for the facts to be found by an arbitrator chosen by them. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry</span>, 48 FLRA at 593-94. These factual findings, to which we defer, fully support the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the grievant's travel resulted from an event that was not administratively controlled by the Agency, satisfying the first requirement set forth above. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1482 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's determination with respect to the second requirement set forth above. As both requirements are satisfied, we conclude that the award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1923</span>, 20 FLRA 583, 584 (1985) (grievant's travel did not result from an event that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because travel time is not compensable as hours of employment when travel is on nonduty time unless the event necessitating it is one that could not be scheduled or controlled administratively, 5 USC 5542(b)(2)(B)(iv), a contrary award will be set aside without regard to a conclusion that the compensation is required by a negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 20 FLRA 583 (1985). An award of travel time was set aside because the travel was scheduled and controlled administratively by the agency. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 15 FLRA 459, 460 (1984). If travel time was controlled administratively, it could not be compensated for through overtime, even though the arbitrator thought that the agency should have attempted to schedule travel during the normal work hours of the employees. <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Danbury and AFGE, Council of Prison Locals</span>, 16 FLRA 811, 811-12 (1984). An award for travel time for carrying supplies or equipment was reviewed against now defunct FPM requirements in <span class="Italic">INS and AFGE Local 2580</span>, 19 FLRA 319, 320-21 (1985). An arbitrator could implement 5 USC 6101(b)(2), requiring agencies to schedule employee travel during duty hours to the maximum extent possible, by directing the agency to schedule future travel of an employee during normal hours to the maximum extent possible. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 22 FLRA 154, 158 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Travel by an employee between work and home is a normal incident of employment, and it is not compensable as hours of work or employment under 5 USC 5542. Section 5542(b)(2) has exceptions to the normal rule, but those exceptions do not apply to employees who are called back to work to respond to an emergency unless actual work is performed during the travel or the travel is performed under arduous conditions. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 37 FLRA 1469, 1475-77 (1990); 5 CFR 550.112(g)(2) (2022).

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Pub. Works Ctr. and IAM Hawaii Fed. Lodge 1998</span>, 55 FLRA 487, 490-91 (1999), declined to overturn an award of overtime under the "Portal-to-Portal Act of 1947," 29 USC 254, involving a claim arising from the alleged custom or practice of payment of time spent by wharfbuilders being transported to the jobsite:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, we find that 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(a) provides that no employer is liable for overtime payment for time employees spend walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of work which the employees are employed to perform. However, section 254(b) sets forth an exception to section 254(a) that provides that an employer shall not be relieved from paying employees if such activity is compensable by a custom or practice in effect at the time of such activity. Contrary to the Agency's contention that it never changed employees' schedules at the start of the day and never paid them to travel to work, but only allowed employees to leave the job site during duty hours at the end of the day, the Arbitrator found otherwise. The Arbitrator, to whose factual findings we defer, found that a practice existed at the activity whereby the employees reported to the compound at the start of their shift for transport to job sites on Ford Island on duty time. The Arbitrator then applied the provisions of the Act to the facts. The Arbitrator concluded that under section 254(b)(2) of the Act, a practice had existed. Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the Arbitrator, that the Agency had deviated from its practice of transporting employees from the compound to the work site while on duty time, by requiring the employees to report to the ferry for transport to Ford Island prior to the start of their duty time. Because the Agency changed its practice by requiring the grievants to report to the ferry for transport to Ford Island before the start of their duty time, rather than report to the compound for transport on duty time, and because this change was to a custom or practice under section 254(b), the grievants were entitled to be paid for the time they were required to spend riding the ferry prior to the start of their duty hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the Agency's argument regarding 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5544(a), that provision concerns employees in a travel status away from their official duty station. Here, there is no evidence that the employees were in a travel status because no travel orders were issued to the employees. Likewise, there is no evidence that the employees were away from their official duty station. Rather, the record indicates that the employees have performed official duties at Ford Island since at least 1975. Accordingly, the Agency's reliance on section 5544(a) is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 405 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Butner</span>, 67 FLRA 395, 398 (2014) (FLSA overtime was allowable for time spent driving from one worksite to another under 5 CFR 551.422(a)(1)). </p>

<p class="noindent-1">Even if, as the Union argues, the Agency effectively required employees to drive to and from the training, the Union has not established that employees are entitled to overtime pay. In this regard, &#x00A7; 551.422(a)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that "[t]ime spent traveling shall be considered hours of work if...[a]n employee is required to <span class="Italic">drive a vehicle or perform other work</span> while traveling." By stating that driving "or perform[ing] other work" entitles an employee to overtime, the regulation clearly implies <span id="page_2146"></span>that the driving itself must be a work duty in order for the employee to earn overtime. Moreover, where courts have addressed &#x00A7; 551.422(a) in the commuting context, they have found that employees are not entitled to overtime pay for work-to-home travel where they do not perform other work while driving.[15] And, although this case does not involve a typical work-to-home commute, the Union fails to cite any authority in support of its position that, under &#x00A7; 551.422(a)(2), an employee returning from a mandatory training--while performing no compensable work during the journey--is entitled to overtime for time spent traveling.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an award of FLSA pay for increased travel time incurred by employees who were required to report to a new work location.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator could not have enforced Article 29, Section 3E as an "express provision" under &#x00A7; 254(b) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLSA was amended by the Portal-to-Portal Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254. Section 254(a) provides that no employer is liable for minimum wages, or overtime compensation, for time employees spend walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of work which the employees are entitled to perform. However, &#x00A7; 254(b) sets forth an exception that provides that an employer shall not be relieved from compensating employees if such activity is compensable by either "an express provision of a written or nonwritten contract...between [the employee's] collective-bargaining representative and his employer[,]" or "a custom or practice in effect, at the time of such activity." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 254(b); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 490 (Authority found that, pursuant to &#x00A7; 254(b), agency's established practice of transporting employees to the job site after they started their shift, and subsequently transporting employees from the job site before quitting time, entitled employees to be paid for transportation time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in &#x00A7; 254(b) requires that a contract, custom or practice be set forth with any particular degree of precision or specificity. Further, we find nothing in judicial opinions involving the Portal-to-Portal Act that set forth a standard by which contracts, customs or practices are to be evaluated for purposes of determining an employer's liability for claims of compensation....</p>

The employees claimed that such travel time was compensable overtime under the FLSA. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed. As relevant here, the court found that the employees' travel time fell within the prohibition on compensation under &#x00A7; 254(a). The court then held, after addressing whether the negotiated agreements rendered the travel time compensable "as allowed by &#x00A7; [25]4(b)," that "the only reasonable construction was that the [travel time] did not comprise compensable work hours<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 809. Nowhere in this decision is there any description of particular wording or specificity that an agreement must contain in order to constitute an express provision of a written contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same applies to <span class="Italic">Spencer, </span>1991 WL 32361, in which the court held that an employer's policy of compensating some travel expenses did not amount to a custom or contract for payment of all travel time pursuant to &#x00A7; 254(b). There is no discussion of any precision or specificity that is required in assessing whether a policy authorizes compensation consistent with &#x00A7; 254(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the decisions in <span class="Italic">Ralph and Spencer, </span>in which compensation was not authorized under &#x00A7; 254(b), decisions holding employers liable for compensation under &#x00A7; 254(b) also did not set forth any standard that a contract, custom or practice had to satisfy. For example, in <span class="Italic">Wirtz v. Sherman Enter., </span>229 F. Supp. 746 (1964), the court analyzed whether the employer's practice of paying employees $1.00 for each forty miles of travel time from job site to job site should be included in calculating the amount of overtime due the employees. Based upon the evidence of that practice, the court concluded that there was an express provision of the employment contract in effect between the parties and that, under &#x00A7; 254(b), the employer was liable for compensation. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Superior Casing Crews,</span> 299 F. Supp. 725 (1969), the court credited testimony, which established that the employer agreed to pay employees for time that they traveled in boats to and from offshore oil rigs. Neither of these decisions required any particular precision or specificity in the practice or contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the parties' intent in negotiating Article 29, Section 3E, was to authorize compensation for employee commute time. On this basis, the Arbitrator held that the provision constitutes an "express provision" under the Portal-to-Portal Act. Neither the Agency's arguments nor the decisions on which it relies persuades us that the Arbitrator's award is incorrect, as a matter of law. Consequently, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 57 FLRA 444 (2001), was not mentioned in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Ft. Worth and AFGE Local 1287</span>, 70 FLRA 446, 448 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), setting aside an award of overtime pay for correctional officers for travel time between the location of their regular work, the correctional facility, and the location of some overtime work, local hospitals where inmates were transported for specialized treatment. The correctional officers, who apparently volunteered for the work so they could earn overtime, were not within the scope of the regulation stating that time in travel time is compensable if it is within the employee's administrative workweek, including regular overtime work, if an employee is required to travel during regular working hours. FLRA relied on 5 CFR 550.112(g) and 5 CFR 551.422(a), and in footnote 18 it explained its rational as it responded to the dissent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Simply put, because the officers' regular work shifts have ended, there is no entitlement to overtime compensation for however the officers transported themselves elsewhere. That is the question in this case, namely, when did the officers' regular work hours end. The dissent's reliance on Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 551-10, issued in 1976, does not change or challenge the finding that the officers' workday ended at the end of their regular working hours. To conclude that the officers could, or should, be paid for time driving to a new shift for which they volunteered makes no more sense than to pay employees to drive from their homes to an overtime shift for which they volunteer. Further, the fact remains that the FPM was sunsetted for good by the end of 1994. As the dissent also notes, the Authority would apply the FPM provisions only if those provisions had been incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations <span class="Italic">without substantive change</span>, a high standard the dissent in no way demonstrates. Also, our decision is much more in keeping with the guidance of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in its decisions of <span class="Italic">Adams v. United States</span>, 471 F.3d 1321 (2006), and <span class="Italic">Bobo v. United States</span>, 136 F.3d 1465 (1998), in which that court was unpersuaded by attempts to expand compensation to the drive away from work. Finally, our decision here is well within the guidance of the U.S. Supreme Court decision <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing v. Busk</span>, 135 S. Ct. 513, 519 (2014). There, Justice Thomas, writing for the full Court, noted that the lower court had erred in its review by focusing on whether an employer "required" a particular activity, in that case, post-shift security screenings. These precedents are more persuasive, and even binding, than an OPM letter from 1976 (predating the Civil Service Reform Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the abolished FPM letter applied, it would not support the dissent's position. That letter stated that time spent traveling outside of regular working hours was compensable <span class="Italic">only if</span> it was "authorized travel." FPM Letter No. 551-10 at 1 (1976). And the letter defined "[a]uthorized travel" as travel that was performed "[u]nder the direction and control of...the employing agency." Attachment to FPM Letter No. 551-10 at 1. Here, as noted above, the Union has not filed a timely exception to the Arbitrator's characterization of the travel as voluntary. <span class="Italic">See Balestrieri v. Menlo Park Fire Prot. Dist</span>., 800 F.3d 1094, 1097-98, 1101 (9th Cir. 2015) (finding that employees who volunteered to work an overtime shift were not entitled to compensation while traveling to it). Thus, there is no basis for finding that the travel was under the direction and control of the Agency, and the travel was not compensable as "authorized travel" under FPM Letter 551-10.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FCC Ft. Worth</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCC Beaumont and AFGE Local 1010</span>, 70 FLRA 477 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (correctional personnel who volunteered to work overtime at hospitals). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bridges v. United States</span>, <span class="blue">54 F.4th 703</span> (Fed. Cir. 2022) (denying FLSA claim for travel time, argued as a principal activity, from a prison to local hospitals for a voluntary overtime hospital shift; also denying the claim under a "continuous workday" argument).</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract provided a basis for an overtime claim for travel time in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, SUPSHIP and NAGE Local R5-125</span>, 57 FLRA 744, 745-47 (2002). Comptroller General decisions, and interpretations of the FLSA were not controlling. Those cases did not involve contract entitlements.</p>
