<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-160"><span class="space">7.</span> Spouse Equity Act of 1984 as Amended</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Statutory amendments--somewhat opaque--addressed impediments to the creation of a survivor annuity for a former spouse. The ability to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse changed over the years in response to congressional concerns about the financial plight of spouses who are divorced following retirement of an employee. <span class="Italic">Mugler v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 619, 620-21 n.2 (1988), summarized the legislative developments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to May 7, 1985, a civil service annuitant was prohibited from providing a survivor annuity for a spouse if their marriage ended in divorce. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 23 MSPR 103, 105 (1984). Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) (1980) obligated OPM to honor court-approved divorce decrees apportioning a retiree's annuity payments, there was no corresponding provision obligating OPM to honor a divorce decree ordering a retiree to maintain a survivor annuity for a former spouse. The Spouse Equity Act, which was effective May 7, 1985, required that OPM honor divorce decrees ordering retirees to provide survivor annuities for their former spouses. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 98-615, section 2(3), subsection h(1), 98 Stat. 3195, 3200 (1984). However, the Spouse Equity Act only applied to individuals who were married to employees who retired on or after May 7, 1985. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> section 4(a)(1), 98 Stat. 3195, 3204 (1984). In February 1986, Congress amended the Spouse Equity Act by enacting Public Law No. 99-251 to broaden the class of individuals to whom the Act applied. Public Law No. 99-251 made the Act applicable to individuals who were married to retirees on May 7, 1985, unless the retirees had waived the spousal survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 99-251, subsection 4(a)(1)(B), 100 Stat. 14, 20 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Copeland v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 288, 289-90 (1986), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[O]n February 27, 1986...Congress amended the Act with respect to the availability of survivor annuities to ex-spouses of deceased employees. Congress liberalized the conditions under which a former spouse is <span id="Page_4376"></span>entitled to survivor annuity payments by adding a provision eliminating the requirement that the dissolution of the marriage had to occur after September 14, 1978, <span class="Italic">if</span> there is no surviving spouse, no other former spouse of the employee who is entitled to receive a survivor annuity, and no other person who has been designated to receive a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fletcher v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 445, 448 (1989), provided additional details:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Spouse Equity Act, former spouses of Federal employees meeting certain requirements may be entitled to survivor annuities. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 98-615, Section 4(b)(1)(B), reprinted at 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 8341 note. To qualify, a former spouse must satisfy the following conditions: (1) She was divorced after September 14, 1978; (2) she has not remarried before the age of fifty-five; (3) she was married during ten years of creditable service; (4) she is at least fifty years old; and (5) she has applied for the benefit by May 9, 1987.<span class="Italic"> See id.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622. On February 27, 1986, Congress amended the Act to eliminate the requirement that the dissolution of the marriage had to occur after September 14, 1978, if there existed no surviving spouse or former spouse who was entitled to a survivor annuity and no other person who had been designated to receive a survivor annuity by reason of an insurable interest in the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act, Pub. L. No. 99-251, Section 201(b) (promulgated at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(a)(2)). Thus, as OPM correctly determined, the appellant could not be entitled under these statutes to a survivor annuity as a former spouse, if OPM found that a "current spouse"[5] was receiving or was designated to receive a survivor annuity based on the service of the same employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In order to qualify as a "current spouse," the decedent and Elsie Mae must have a recognized marriage in the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the marital status of the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.603. In this case, that jurisdiction is the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to former spouses, <span class="Italic">Shank v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 491, 493 (1989), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, as amended by the Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986, provides survivor benefits for former spouses of Federal employees who retired with annuity commencing dates effective prior to May 7, 1985 (as well as for the former spouses of employees who died in service before May 7, 1985, after meeting the age and service requirements for immediate retirement). <span class="Italic">See</span> sections 4(b)(1) and 4(b)(4) of Pub. L. No. 98-615, <span class="Italic">as amended by</span> Pub. L. No. 99-251, Title II, &#x00A7; 201(a) to (c), Feb. 27, 1986, 100 Stat. 20-23 (1986) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note). The statutory language restricting eligibility for survivor benefits to those applicants whose former spouses retired prior to May 7, 1985, is clear and unequivocal and is uncontradicted by the legislative history.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nelson v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 612, 613-16 (1993), describes how the 1984 Spouse Equity Act permitted divorce decrees to award annuities for former spouses and the limitations of the effective dates of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Intervenor Joseph Nelson retired under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) in 1979 while he was married to Gertrude Nelson. Gertrude Nelson died in 1984, and Joseph Nelson married the appellant on September 20, 1986. In 1988, Joseph Nelson elected to have his annuity reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the appellant. The appellant and Joseph Nelson were divorced in 1990. The court order by which the marriage was dissolved provided in part that Joseph Nelson would "retain [the appellant] as the beneficiary of his Civil Service Retirement Annuity. Said retirement annuity shall continue to be reduced to provide the survivor annuity indicated herein." (divorce decree at para. 8.1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, after receiving a copy of the court order from the appellant, notified her that it "intend[ed] to honor" the order. Almost two years later, OPM reversed its position, advising the appellant that, after further review of her situation, it had determined that the divorce decree was not a "qualifying court order" for purposes of awarding her former spouse survivor benefits. Specifically, OPM held that, by regulation, two conditions, when taken together, precluded it from honoring the court order: The order dissolved a marriage that did not take place until after May 7, 1985, when OPM received statutory authorization to honor orders awarding survivor benefits; and the marriage was to an annuitant who retired before OPM received such authorization. Upon the appellant's request for reconsideration, OPM again concluded that it could not honor the court order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent express statutory authority, OPM may not honor the court order that requires Joseph Nelson to continue to have his CSRS annuity reduced to provide survivor benefits for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a) (CSRS benefits are exempt from legal process, except as provided for by federal law). OPM based its reconsideration decision on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(d)(2)(iii)(B), which provides in relevant part that, "[i]n the case of a post-retirement marriage," OPM will not honor a court order purporting to award a former spouse survivor annuity where "the annuitant had not elected to provide a survivor annuity for that spouse before May 7, 1985." The appellant's claim that the regulation was not meant to apply to her is, in essence, a claim that Congress actually intended for OPM to honor orders such as the one that dissolved her marriage to Joseph Nelson. Although OPM and the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant is not entitled to CSRS survivor benefits, they did not analyze the statutory provisions upon which 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(d)(2)(iii)(B) is based. We reopen the appeal in order to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act (CSRSEA), Pub. L. No. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195, became law on November 8, 1984, and went into effect on May 7, 1985. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note. The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee observed that, under the law as it existed prior to the CSRSEA, "a court [could] order [OPM] to pay all or a portion of an employee's...annuity [payable during the employee's life] to a former spouse, but a court [could] not require that a survivor benefit be provided for a former spouse." H.R. No. 98-1054, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 11 (reprinted in 1984 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 5540, 5541). Section 2(4)(G) of the CSRSEA authorized OPM to honor a court order awarding CSRS survivor benefits to <span id="Page_4377"></span>the former spouse of an employee or retiree. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2(3)(A) of the CSRSEA made two additional changes to the CSRS that are relevant to this appeal. First, it allowed a retiree to elect to provide a survivor annuity for a spouse acquired after retirement, so long as the retiree had been married at the time of retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(C)(i). The latter spouse's right to receive a survivor annuity would terminate upon his or her divorce from the retiree, unless the spouse was entitled to a survivor annuity under the terms of a court order. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A). Second, a retiree could elect to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse within two years of the date that his or her marriage to that spouse was dissolved. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress did not intend for the statutory changes described above to have universal application, however. Section 4(a)(1) of the CSRSEA, as amended, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (6) and subsections (b) and (c), the amendments made by section 2 of this Act shall take effect May 7, 1985, and shall apply--(A) to any individual who, on or after such date, is married to an employee...who, on or after such date, retires, dies, or applies for a refund of [CSRS] contributions...and (B) to any individual who, as of such date, is married to a retired employee....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note. Joseph Nelson retired--that is, he ceased being an "employee"--in 1979, and the appellant did not marry him until 1986. Thus, she does not fall into either of the two primary categories of people to whom the CSRSEA applies. The six exceptions referenced in section 4(a)(1) above expand the coverage of portions of the CSRSEA to certain other classes of people, but they do not expand the coverage of the relevant portion of section 2(4)(G); specifically, none of the exceptions authorizes OPM to honor a court order awarding survivor benefits to the former spouse of a CSRS annuitant, where the annuitant retired before May 7, 1985, and the former spouse married the annuitant after that date. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 4(a)(6) of the CSRSEA, as amended, expands the coverage of section 2(4)(G) to all marriages occurring after May 7, 1985, "but only to the extent that [section 2(4)(G)] amends title 5 [U.S.C.], by adding a new section 8341(i)."<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note. Section 8341(i) relates to duration-of-marriage requirements for eligibility for survivor benefits. The authority for OPM to honor court orders relating to survivor benefits, also added by section 2(4)(G), appears at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's contention, then, the court order that dissolved her marriage to Joseph Nelson did not preserve her right to receive a survivor annuity, because the authority for OPM to honor court orders awarding survivor annuities is inapplicable. Rather, her right to receive a CSRS survivor annuity terminated upon her divorce from Joseph Nelson. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A). Moreover, the appellant's claim that the regulation upon which OPM relied in its reconsideration decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1004(d)(2)(iii)(B), should not apply here because there is nothing that she "could have possibly done...to avoid the court order...being deemed non-qualified," misses the point. Based on the language of the statute, we conclude that Congress did not intend for the provisions of the CSRSEA that relate to the award of former spouse survivor benefits to apply to the appellant and those similarly situated. The regulation carries out this intent.</p>
