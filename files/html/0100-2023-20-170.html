<p class="Body-Text">Although political activities under the Hatch Act are beyond the scope of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span> by reason of the principal involvement of state and local government employees (although federal employees do find themselves on the receiving end of Hatch Act disciplinary actions), OSC has additional authority under 5 USC 1216 to investigate and prosecute the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In addition to the authority otherwise provided in this chapter, the Special Counsel shall, except as provided in subsection (b), conduct an investigation of any allegation concerning--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;political activity prohibited under subchapter III of chapter 73, relating to political activities by Federal employees;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;political activity prohibited under chapter 15, relating to political activities by certain State and local officers and employees;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;arbitrary or capricious withholding of information prohibited under section 552, except that the Special Counsel shall make no investigation of any withholding of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information the disclosure of which is specifically prohibited by law or by Executive order;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;activities prohibited by any civil service law, rule, or regulation, including any activity relating to political intrusion in personnel decisionmaking; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;involvement by any employee in any prohibited discrimination found by any court or appropriate administrative authority to have occurred in the course of any personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The Special Counsel shall make no investigation of any allegation of any prohibited activity referred to in subsection (a)(5), if the Special Counsel determines that the allegation may be resolved more appropriately under an administrative appeals procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;If the Special Counsel receives an allegation concerning any matter under paragraph (1), (3), (4), or (5) of subsection (a), the Special Counsel may investigate and seek corrective action under section 1214 and disciplinary action under section 1215 in the same way as if a prohibited personnel practice were involved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The legislative history of the Hatch Act is provided in <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 522 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Refer to <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Jackson</span>, 119 MSPR 175, 2013 MSPB 10 (2013), for discussion of hearing procedure differences in cases involving federal employees and cases involving state or local government employees. OSC may initiate a complaint on its own initiative, without complaint by someone else about prohibited participation in partisan political activities. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. MSPB</span>, 594 Fed. Appx. 974 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Murry,</span> CB-1216-15-0002-T-1 n.4 (NP 11/3/2015) ("The Modernization Act, Pub. L. No. 112-230, 126 Stat. 1616, 1616-18 (2012), scaled back the provision of the Hatch Act forbidding certain state and local employees from seeking elective office and clarified the application of certain provisions to the District of Columbia."). Refer to 5 USC 7321-26 for provisions of the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency managers may not remove or suspend an employee for violating the Hatch Act. The Special Counsel possesses exclusive authority to investigate and charge an employee with violating the Hatch Act, and the Board has exclusive authority to discipline a federal employee for violating the statute. <span class="Italic">Kauffman v.

Cir. 2005) (providing background and interpretation of the Hatch Act and 1993 amendments to that legislation); <span class="Italic">Briggs v. MSPB</span>, 331 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (considering and rejecting challenges to the constitutionality of portions of the Hatch Act); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v.

Greiner</span>, CB-1216-08-0025-R-1 (NP 5/28/2013)). For an example of a Hatch Act case resulting in removal for a federal employee for an attempt to influence a political contribution from an another employee, refer to <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Acconcia</span>, 107 MSPR 60, 2007 MSPB 227 (2007), and refer to <span class="Italic">Briggs v. MSPB</span>, 322 Fed. Appx. 983 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), for an example of a determination to remove from federal employment an individual who became a candidate associated with a political party for a local elective office. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ware</span>, 114 MSPR 128, 2010 MSPB 105 (2010) (removal of Treasury Department program analyst and contracting officer's technical representative who, while on duty, circulated multiple emails from her government computer and email account to individuals, including several contractor employees, soliciting contributions to the Obama presidential campaign), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mark</span>, 114 MSPR 516, 2010 MSPB 159 (2010) (120-day suspension rather than removal was appropriate for an individual who used government equipment to send one batch of political messages on behalf of the Obama campaign). Cases involving Hatch Act violations are settled, and those settlements may be accepted by the Board coupled with a Board order directing corrective action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">OSC v. Wilkinson</span>, 111 MSPR 160, 2009 MSPB 63 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That facts leading to an adverse action could be of interest to the Special Counsel under the Hatch Act does not preclude an agency from taking the action on a different basis, as in <span class="Italic">Voorhis v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 538, 550-51 &#x00B6; 29, 2011 MSPB 67 (2011), involving improper disclosure of information from a government database for the purpose of influencing a state political campaign:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to establish that the charges brought against him by the agency are within the exclusive authority of OSC</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the first three charges against him are "thinly veiled Hatch Act charges which are the exclusive jurisdiction" of OSC, and therefore only OSC may investigate or prosecute cases involving factual allegations of prohibited political activity. First, as the administrative judge recognized, any disciplinary action that an agency might take against an employee does not preempt OSC's specific statutory authority to prosecute Hatch Act violations. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Winfield,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 402, 407 (1983). Second, the appellant misconstrues the "essence" of Charges 1, 2, and 3. The appellant fails to appreciate that the factual basis of Charges 1, 2, and 3 is that the appellant made unauthorized queries of federal databases as a result of a personal relationship he formed with Mr. Marshall, who requested that the appellant perform such queries, and that he disclosed the results of those queries to Mr. Marshall who had no legitimate reason to know the information. In describing the bases for its charges in the notice of proposed removal, the agency stated that it found the appellant's actions in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct, which prohibit federal employees from misusing their position by allowing the improper use of nonpublic information to further any private interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(3). As noted by the administrative judge, the private interest furthered "in this particular case happened to be a candidate in a partisan political campaign" in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct. Accordingly, while the appellant's actions may also be of interest to OSC given the political undercurrent, we discern no error by the administrative judge in finding that the agency had the authority to discipline the appellant on the basis that his actions violated the Standards of Ethical Conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While the <span class="Italic">Guide</span> does not discuss the theory or merits of Hatch Act cases, one decision, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Smith</span>, 116 MSPR 520, 521-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9, 2011 MSPB 69 (2011), is of significance for of its analysis of the requirement that OSC Hatch Act complaints be pleaded with reasonable specificity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3929"></span>On December 10, 2009, OSC filed a complaint with the Board alleging that the respondent violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7324(a)(1)-(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 734.306(a)(1), (3), commonly known as the Hatch Act, by engaging in political activity while on duty and while in a government building through the use of a government owned computer. OSC's complaint described the time of the alleged offenses as "[t]hroughout 2008" and stated that the alleged offenses involved e-mails and the drafting of documents "directed toward the success of Barack Obama's candidacy for President."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the close of discovery, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the charging document was so vague and the discovery documents were so voluminous and "undifferentiated" that the respondent was left "to guess at the nature of the charges and the documents that were the factual basis for those charges." The administrative law judge granted the respondent's motion, holding that OSC had failed to place the respondent "on notice that would enable him to draft responsive pleadings or prepare for trial." OSC filed a timely petition for review seeking reversal of the initial decision, or, in the alternative, leave to file an amended complaint, a copy of which it attached to its petition for review. The respondent timely responded in opposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Because OSC's complaint failed to comply with the Board's regulations, as well as constitutional requirements, the administrative law judge properly dismissed OSC's complaint.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Erickson</span>, 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 542 (1985)). In this regard, due process mandates that notice be sufficiently detailed to make the reply opportunity meaningful. <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Goldberg v. Kelly,</span> 397 U.S. 254, 267-68 (1970). In keeping with this principle, the Board's regulations mandate that when OSC files a written complaint alleging a violation, the complaint must state "with particularity any alleged violations of law or regulation, along with the supporting facts." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1215(a)(1), 1216.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC's complaint lacked this necessary particularity and supporting facts. With respect to the alleged e-mails, OSC did not identify the dates the e-mails were sent, the recipients, or the content, other than to state that the content was purportedly intended to aid the Obama campaign. The alleged documents drafted or edited by the respondent were "website materials and speech outlines" but, once again, the content of the documents was not described with any specificity. Furthermore, the complaint also did not contain any attachments or copies of the documents to identify the specific e-mails or materials that constituted the basis for its charges. Similarly, the location where the offenses occurred was not described other than a statement that the appellant engaged in the alleged conduct "while in a room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, OSC asserts that its complaint met the Board's requirements for particularity. OSC asserts that "[n]othing in the Board's regulations or case law require [sic] that the complaint outline each specific instance of Respondent's political activity." OSC is mistaken; outlining each specification is precisely what OSC is required to do. As the administrative law judge correctly noted, "[t]he Board has consistently held that a party must know of the claims with which he is being charged so that he may adequately prepare and present a defense." <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 50, 57 (1991); <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 161, 179 (1996) (stating that, although the complaint in an OSC disciplinary action need not state every one of OSC's legal theories, it must provide the respondent with sufficient notice of OSC's claims to allow him to prepare a defense); <span class="Italic">Hartigan v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 613, 618 (1989); <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 427, 429 (1988). A respondent cannot be expected to prepare a defense to each specification of a charge unless each specification is listed with sufficient identifying information to permit the respondent to know what event is at issue in the case. Informing a respondent that he is charged with drafting and/or editing documents or sending e-mails in the year 2008 is not sufficient to provide a respondent with adequate knowledge of the alleged conduct that OSC believes violated the law. He must be put on notice regarding which documents and which e-mails OSC believes violated the law. It is true that OSC need not always describe each event down to the very minute, as OSC has done in its amended complaint, but a precisely drafted complaint serves the parties and the adjudicator well as it reduces the potential for confusion as to the conduct at issue. In contrast, a poorly drafted, vague complaint that does not inform a respondent precisely how OSC believes that he has violated the law and that does not inform a judge as to what must be adjudicated, serves no one--including OSC, given the risk such a complaint may be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC is correct that the Board does not require "that OSC attach all the documents supporting its charges" to its complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123. However, the administrative law judge did not hold that OSC <span class="Italic">must</span> provide such attachments to its complaint; he merely noted that such documents might have provided the specificity that was lacking in OSC's written description of the alleged events in question. In a case where creating and sending documents constitute the alleged misconduct, attaching the documents to the complaint as exhibits and citing the relevant exhibit when listing the specifications is one method by which OSC can prevent confusion as to the conduct being charged and provide the requisite "supporting facts." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215(a); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.123.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC asserts that the respondent did not receive the complaint "in a vacuum" and that OSC had interviewed the respondent twice prior to filing its complaint. OSC contends that as a result, "Respondent knew full well what the charges in the Complaint referenced." OSC's investigative interviews do not constitute a charging document, however. As OSC indicated on petition for review, during its interviews of the respondent, it presented him with "hundreds of pages...of documents," including "a large number of the e-mails at issue." The volume of documents presented to the respondent during the investigative process indicates that the interviews were not sufficiently focused to place him on notice of the precise allegations against him. <span class="Italic">See Brock v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 564, 569 (1991) (holding that, under the circumstances of the case, interviewing the appellant was not sufficient to make her aware of the exact nature of the charges against her). Further, OSC seems to concede that, during the interviews, it did not provide the respondent with all of the e-mails it considered problematic. Accordingly, we conclude that the administrative law judge correctly determined that OSC's December 10, 2009 complaint should be dismissed.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Both the petitioner and the respondent have cited the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in support of their positions with respect to the dismissal of the complaint. However, as the administrative law judge correctly noted, the Board is not bound by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but looks to them for guidance. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 10 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">see Stout v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 389 F.3d 1233, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We have considered the parties' arguments concerning the applicability of the Federal Rules and find no error in the administrative law judge's decision in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OSC is not permitted to amend the complaint, but a new complaint may be filed.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that double jeopardy does not apply to administrative proceedings, and "an agency can renew an adverse action based on charges brought in an earlier proceeding where the adverse action in that proceeding was invalidated on procedural grounds." <span class="Italic">Steele v. General Services Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 368, 372 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Tezak v. Department of the Army</span>, 835 F.2d 871 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table); <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 620, 624 (1990). Because the administrative law judge dismissed OSC's complaint without reviewing the merits, OSC is free to file a properly detailed complaint in this matter. However, when "an agency fails to comply with applicable termination procedures, its remedy is not to seek review of the reversal, but to correct the procedural failure by providing appellant [or respondent with] full procedural rights in a new termination action." <span class="Italic">Steele</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 372 n.5. We therefore deny OSC's request to vacate the initial decision. However, we will consider OSC's request to amend the complaint as a request to refile, and instruct the Clerk of the Board to accept the amended complaint as a new complaint for docketing.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An ALJ may enter a default against a respondent employee in a Hatch Act case if the employee fails to respond to a complaint, but the Board will set aside the default if it is unintentional and proceed with adjudication of the case on the merits, the result in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Salas,</span> CB-1216-09-0010-T-1 (NP 6/29/2011) (Member Rose dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC filed a complaint seeking disciplinary action under the Hatch Act against the respondent, an employee of the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Chief Counsel (OCC). OSC charged the respondent with violating 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7323(a)(1) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.302 by using her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the results of the 2008 Presidential election, violating 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7324(a)(1) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.306(a)(1) by engaging in political activity while on duty, and violating 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7324(a)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 734.306(a)(3) by engaging in political activity while in a room or building occupied in the discharge of official duties. Underlying the above three counts, OSC alleged that on or about January 9, 2008, the respondent sent one <span id="Page_3930"></span>electronic mail (email) message to six recipients, including two alleged "subordinate" employees. OSC submitted with its complaint copies of the email message and a December 19, 2007 email from the agency to OCC employees reminding them of the Hatch Act prohibitions against campaigning in the work place or conducting partisan political activity while on duty or in a government building.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Clerk of the Board timely informed the respondent that she could file a response to the complaint with the Clerk's Office, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.124 and attached a copy of the Board's regulations. The assigned ALJ issued a show cause order when the respondent did not respond to OSC's complaint. OSC later filed a motion for default judgment, arguing that the respondent had waived her right to contest OSC's allegations and that she did not file a reply to the ALJ's order or to OSC's motion. The ALJ then found, among other things, that the allegations set forth in OSC's complaint were considered admitted because the respondent failed to respond to complaint. The ALJ further found that the respondent violated the Hatch Act by using her official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election, and by engaging in political activity while on duty in her government office. Finally, the ALJ found that the presumptive penalty of removal was appropriate given several aggravating factors and little evidence in support of mitigation. Accordingly, the ALJ ordered the respondent's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent apparently then retained counsel, and after the Board granted her an extension of time, she filed a timely petition for review. In her petition, the respondent requested the Board to treat her petition as "motion to reopen the default judgment below." She also alleges, among other things, that she has difficulty reading, she did not understand the proceedings against her, she was not "on duty" as charged by OSC when she sent the email, she is not a supervisor, and Elaine Rodriguez and Irma Reilly were not her subordinate employees as charged by OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent further alleges in her petition for review that the penalty of removal is excessive for her alleged Hatch Act offenses. In this regard, she notes that she has worked in clerical, non-supervisory positions since 1981; she has never been disciplined; she is friends with Elaine Rodriguez and Irma Reilly; she reports to supervisor Ira McMillian; and she was injured in the "9/11" attacks on New York. The respondent also alleges that later in January 2008 she met with Ms. McMillian and two union representatives who had a copy of her January 9, 2008 email. The respondent further alleges that at that meeting she apologized for the email, explained that she did not understand the Hatch Act, and that she promptly completed online Hatch Act training at Ms. McMillian's request. In support of her allegations, the respondent submitted her own declaration, the declaration of supervisor McMillian, as well as the declarations of Pat Conte, Elizabeth Pinkowsky, Carmen Baerga and Barbara Miron, her coworkers at the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the plain words of its regulation, the Board has long held that a respondent who fails to answer an OSC complaint is deemed to have admitted the allegations contained in the complaint. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.124(c); <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Fields</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 60, 62 (1993); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Johnson</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 560, 561-62 (1985). The Board, though, has not had an occasion to consider the legal effect of this rule, i.e., the entry of a default and/or default judgment, and whether relief from such a default or default judgment should be based on the Board's customary "good cause" standard or a different good cause standard suggested by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal courts have noted that "judgment by default is a drastic step appropriate only in extreme circumstances; a case should, whenever possible, be decided on the merits." <span class="Italic">United States v. Signed Personal Check No. 730 of Yubran S. Mesle</span>, 615 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir. 2010). The Federal Rules provide that a court "may set aside an entry of default for good cause...." Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c). To determine "good cause" under FRCP 55(c), courts generally consider three factors: (1) whether the party seeking to set aside the default engaged in "culpable conduct" that led to the default; (2) whether that party had a meritorious defense; and (3) whether reopening the default would prejudice the other party. <span class="Italic">Mesle</span>, 615 F.3d at 1091; <span class="Italic">see Mohamad v. Rajoub</span>, 634 F.3d 604, 606 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the harsh consequences resulting from the respondent's default here, we find it appropriate to be guided by the general standards for establishing "good cause" pursuant to FRCP 55(c). Conduct is "culpable" if the respondent received actual or constructive notice of OSC's complaint and <span class="Italic">intentionally</span> failed to answer. In this context, however, "intentionally" means more than she simply made a conscious choice not to answer. <span class="Italic">Mesle,</span> 615 F.3d at 1092. She must have acted in "bad faith," such as with the intention to take advantage of OSC, interfere with the Board's decision-making, or otherwise manipulate the legal process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Regardless of how careless or misguided the respondent's failure to respond to the orders of the Board and ALJ might have been, there is no evidence in the record suggesting she was acting in bad faith. We therefore conclude she did not engage in culpable conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All that is necessary to satisfy the second "meritorious defense" requirement is to allege sufficient facts that, if true, would constitute a defense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1094. This burden is "minimal," and the Board should not determine if the factual allegations are true in deciding whether to relieve the respondent of the default. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The respondent's factual allegations on petition for review, supported by documents and declarations under penalty of perjury, raise significant questions regarding whether she was "on duty" and whether she was attempting to interfere with or affect the results of the 2008 Presidential election when she forwarded the single email charged by OSC. Further, in the context of a Hatch Act complaint filed by OSC, we believe that "penalty" issues should be considered under the "meritorious defense" factor. The respondent has made several allegations of fact, with documentary support and accompanying declarations, which raise serious doubt about the appropriateness of the removal penalty sought by OSC and ordered by the ALJ. In this regard, we note that the ALJ's initial decision was issued nearly 1 year before the Board issued its final, precedential decisions in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128 (2010) and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mark</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 516 (2010). We believe the parties and the ALJ should have the opportunity to respectively present and consider evidence and argument regarding penalty as explained in these two precedential decisions. <span class="Italic">See Mark</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (removal not appropriate for single email violating Hatch Act when respondent was not engaged in fundraising or campaign activity and he was not the supervisor of the employees receiving the email). We therefore conclude that the respondent has satisfied the "meritorious defense" factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third and final factor for the Board to consider is whether OSC would be prejudiced by setting aside the default. Mere passage of time is not a valid consideration for the Board in this regard. <span class="Italic">Mesle</span>, 615 F.3d at 1094-95. After reviewing the record before us, we find no basis to conclude that OSC would be prejudiced by setting aside the respondent's default.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon concluding that the respondent violated the Hatch Act, the administrative law judge determined that the respondent should be removed from federal service. As the administrative law judge explained, however, Congress passed the Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012 (Modernization Act), Pub. L. No. 112-230, 126 Stat. 1616, prior to OSC's filing the instant complaint against the respondent. <span class="Italic">See</span> Modernization Act, &#x00A7; 5(a) (providing that "the amendments made by this Act shall take effect 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act").[2] Among several changes to the Hatch Act, the Modernization Act "provid[es] more flexibility with respect to penalties that may be imposed on federal employees for Hatch Act violations." S. Rep. No. 112-211, at 2 (2012). Specifically, under the Modernization Act, removal from employment is no longer the presumptive penalty for a federal employee's violation of the Hatch Act; rather, amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326 now provides that "[A]n employee or individual who violates section 7323 or 7324 [of Title 5] shall be subject to removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000." <span class="Italic">See</span> Modernization Act, &#x00A7; 4 (striking and replacing entirety of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Modernization Act was signed into law by President Obama on December 28, 2012, and went into effect on January 27, 2013. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 112-230, 126 Stat. 1616.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Modernization Act, "the amendment made [to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326] shall apply with respect to any violation occurring before, on, or after the effective date of this Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 5(b)(1). "The amendment [to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326, however,] shall not apply with respect to an alleged violation if, before the effective date of [the Modernization Act], the Special Counsel has presented a complaint for disciplinary action...with respect to the alleged violation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00A7; 5(b)(2)(A).

Noting that the previous version of the Hatch Act provided a presumptive penalty of removal for a violation of the Act, the Board articulated a series of factors to be considered when determining whether the presumptive penalty of removal should be imposed, or whether some lesser penalty, not less than 30 days' suspension, was more appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 20 (2010). These factors, referred to as the <span class="Italic">Purnell</span> factors, <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Purnell</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 184, 200 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Fela v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 730 F. Supp. 779 (N.D. Ohio 1989), included: (1) the nature of the offense and the extent of the employee's participation; (2) the employee's motive and intent; (3) whether the employee had received advice of counsel regarding the activity at issue; (4) whether the employee ceased the activities; (5) the employee's past employment record; and (6) the political coloring of the employee's activities. <span class="Italic">See Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 20. In considering the <span class="Italic">Purnell</span> factors, the Board explained that a respondent who has been found to have violated the Hatch Act has the burden of presenting evidence showing that the Act's presumptive penalty of removal should not be imposed. <span class="Italic">Briggs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Modernization Act, however, removal is no longer the presumptive penalty for a violation of the Hatch Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> Modernization Act, &#x00A7; 4 (striking and replacing the entirety of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326). Under the amended version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326, "[A]n employee or individual who violates section 7323 or 7324 shall be subject to removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000." The Modernization Act's legislative history, moreover, makes clear that the Board should now consider a "broader range of penalties" when determining the appropriate penalty for a federal employee's violation of the Hatch Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-211, at 5. Whereas the Board used to apply the <span class="Italic">Purnell</span> factors to determine whether a respondent presented a sufficient basis to mitigate the presumptive penalty of removal, <span class="Italic">see Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 20, pursuant to the Modernization Act, the Board must now independently determine the proper penalty from among a range of permissible penalties, and we conclude that the Board should apply its <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis in conducting this analysis under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326. As explained in the Modernization Act's legislative history:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he Hatch Act's penalty provision should be modified to allow the MSPB to impose a broader range of penalties...and the [Modernization Act] amends the Hatch Act to authorize the same range of penalties authorized for other disciplinary actions under OSC's jurisdiction. Further, the Committee expects that, in selecting a penalty for a Hatch Act violation, the Board will consider the severity of the violation and other aggravating or mitigating factors, as the Board does with respect to non-Hatch Act violations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-211, at 5; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 78 Fed. Reg. 39543, 39545 (July 2, 2013) (interim regulation for 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.126(c)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other disciplinary actions under OSC's jurisdiction brought before the Board, the Board applies the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Lee</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 57, &#x00B6; 37 (2010), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Beatrez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 298 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors are a nonexhaustive list of twelve factors the Board considers in reviewing and determining an appropriate penalty in, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, employee-initiated appeals under chapter 75 and disciplinary actions filed with the Board by OSC. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Villada v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 6 (2010) (listing the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in a chapter 75 appeal); <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 57, &#x00B6; 37 (in determining the penalty in Special Counsel disciplinary actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1215 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.122-1201.127, the Board applies the factors that are set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering both the changes in the Hatch Act's statutory language and the Modernization Act's legislative history concerning those changes, we find that the Board should now apply the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining the proper penalty for a federal employee's violation of the Hatch Act under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326. Accordingly, in conducting this analysis, the Board now should consider: (1) the nature and seriousness of the offense, including whether the offense was intentional or inadvertent, or was frequently repeated; (2) the employee's job level and type of employment, including any fiduciary or supervisory role; (3) the employee's past disciplinary record; (4) the employee's past work record, including length of service; (5) the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level; (6) the consistency of the penalty with those imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses; (7) the consistency of the penalty with any applicable table of penalties; (8) the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the agency; (9) the clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated; (10) the potential for the employee's rehabilitation; (11) any mitigating circumstances surrounding the offense, such as unusual job tensions; and (12) the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the employee or others. <span class="Italic">See Villada</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 268, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. As in all instances where the Board applies the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, not all of these factors will be pertinent in every case, and the relevant factors must be balanced in each case to arrive at the appropriate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 7 (2013). In reaching this conclusion, we further note that several of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Purnell</span> factors overlap, and we find that the <span class="Italic">Purnell</span> factors continue to provide relevant guidance to our <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis insofar as they address the nature and seriousness of the respondent's offense and whether there are any mitigating circumstances, such as the respondent's reliance on the advice of counsel or his change in conduct once notified that his conduct violates the Hatch Act. <span class="Italic">See Purnell</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 200; <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Modernization Act does not require a respondent to establish why his removal should not be imposed for a violation of the Hatch Act.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Board's prior decisions addressing the Hatch Act, once OSC established that a federal employee violated the Hatch Act, the respondent-employee had the burden of establishing why the presumptive penalty of removal should not be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 20. In other OSC disciplinary proceedings before the Board, however, the Board has recognized that it possesses an independent obligation to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and determine for itself the appropriate penalty under the facts of the particular case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Frederick v. Department of Justice</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 517, 535 (1994) (in disciplinary actions brought by OSC itself, moreover, the Board is not bound by OSC's penalty determinations but instead takes into account the relevant factors enumerated in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Byrd</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 561, 582 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Byrd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 39 F.3d 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mongan</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 392, 398 (1987)), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 73 F.3d 349 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Consistent with our approach in other OSC disciplinary proceedings, therefore, we find that, under the Modernization Act, a respondent does not bear the burden of establishing why he should not be removed from federal service once OSC proves a violation of the Hatch Act. Rather, under the Modernization Act, we find that both OSC and the respondent may submit argument and evidence as to the severity of the violation and other aggravating and mitigating factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7326. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-211, at 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board's prior decisions holding that the respondent bears the burden of establishing why the presumptive penalty of removal should not be imposed are OVERRULED. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ware</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 128, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, affirming the Board, the Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. MSPB</span>, 594 Fed. Appx. 974 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the recent amendments to the Hatch Act, a violation no longer results in an employee's removal from his position unless the Board unanimously finds that the violation warrants removal. Hatch Act Modernization Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-230, &#x00A7; 4, 126 Stat. 1616. Instead, the amendment affords the Board great flexibility in crafting appropriate remedies for such violations, by making clear that an employee who violates the Act "shall be subject to removal, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period not to exceed 5 years, suspension, reprimand, or an assessment of a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After action is commenced through a Hatch Act complaint, a penalty assessed by an ALJ against the respondent in a Hatch Act case cannot be enhanced through newly-offered evidence from OSC of other violations; OSC's obligation is to provide notice and due process when the charges are preferred--an obligation defeated by belated efforts to enhance a penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Arnold</span>, CB-1216-16-0017-T-1 (NP 1/17/2023).</p>
