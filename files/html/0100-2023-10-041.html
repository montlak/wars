<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-41"><span class="space">e.</span> Pending Criminal Proceeding; Indefinite Suspension</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has generally stayed its proceedings pending the completion of a criminal trial because its proceedings could interfere with an ongoing criminal case involving the same conduct." <span class="Italic">Keay v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 331, 335 (1993). <span class="Italic">Wallington v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 42 MSPR 462, 464-66 (1989), stated the law concerning continuance of appeals pending resolution of criminal charges involving the same conduct implicated in the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's decision to suspend the Board's proceedings based on the fact that the appellant was the subject of a criminal proceeding involving the same facts represents a sound practice which the courts and the Board have sanctioned....&#8197;The Board's practice of staying its appellate proceedings under such circumstances recognizes that continuing the Board's proceedings could constitute improper interference with the ongoing criminal case concerning the same conduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the courts have determined that the Constitution does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings<span class="Italic">. Afro-Lecon, Inc. v. United States</span>, 820 F.2d 1198, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Securities and Exchange Commission v. Dresser Industries, Inc</span>., 628 F.2d 1368, 1375 (D.C. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 993 (1980). A court, however, has the discretion to stay civil proceedings during the pendency of criminal proceedings. The standard applicable in determining whether to stay a civil proceeding pending the outcome of criminal proceedings is whether "the interests of justice seem[&#8197;] to require such action." <span class="Italic">Afro-Lecon, Inc</span>., 820 F.2d at 1202, <span class="Italic">quoting United States v. Kordel</span>, 397 U.S. 1, 12 n.27 (1970); <span class="Italic">Dresser Industries, Inc</span>., 628 F.2d at 1375<span class="Italic">. See also Landis v. North American Co.</span>, 299 U.S. 248, 254-55 (1936) (decision to stay parallel proceedings "calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance") (citations omitted). In those cases in which the courts either exercise their discretion to stay civil proceedings or review an administrative exercise to stay administrative proceedings during the pendency of criminal proceedings, the stay generally extends for a reasonable period, to the completion of the criminal trial proceedings<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Afro-Lecon, Inc</span>., 820 F.2d at 1200; <span class="Italic">Peden</span>, 512 F.2d at 1103; <span class="Italic">Silver v. McCamey</span>, 221 F.2d 873, 874-75 (D.C. Cir. 1955).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, in recognition of the fact that its proceedings could constitute improper interference with an ongoing criminal case concerning the same conduct, will stay its proceedings in a Board appeal pending the completion of the criminal trial proceedings<span class="Italic">. See Raymond v. Department of the Army</span>, 34 MSPR 476, 478-79 (1987); <span class="Italic">Green</span>, 16 MSPR at 206. However, just as the pendency of a judicial appeal of a criminal conviction does not ordinarily suspend the operation of an otherwise final judgment as collateral estoppel before the Board, <span class="Italic">see Lively v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 318, 321 (1986), the pendency of a judicial appeal of a criminal conviction will not ordinarily result in a continuation of the stay of Board proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether proceedings before the Board will be stayed pending the final disposition of a criminal case, the Board will determine whether the interests of justice seem to require such action. Applying this standard to the instant case requires a balancing of the appellant's strong interest in postponement of these proceedings until the criminal charge against him is fully resolved[*] against the possible, and presumable, prejudice to the agency in having to wait an indeterminate amount of time to bring the Board proceedings to a conclusion<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Afro-Lecon, Inc</span>., 820 F.2d at 1206. Weighing such interests in the instant case turns largely on the agency's stated position in this matter. As we noted above, an agency may ordinarily be able to properly use collateral estoppel to prove its charges before the Board, if the elements of collateral estoppel are proven, despite the pendency of a criminal appeal of a conviction<span class="Italic">. See Lively</span>, 31 MSPR at 321. However, in its response to the appellant's petition for review, while denying that the appellant's constitutional rights would be prejudiced by continuing with the administrative proceeding, the agency states that it does not object to an order extending the stay until the final disposition of the criminal case "in order to avoid any possibility of conflict between the civil and criminal proceedings in other respects."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] With regard to jeopardizing his defense in the criminal proceeding by having to first depend against the administrative action, the appellant would be in virtually the same position, if his motion for a new trial were granted, as when the stay was originally effected. Likewise, if, on appeal, the court were to vacate the lower court's decision and remand the case for a new trial, the appellant's rights would again be adversely affected by his having to proceed at that time to defend against the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any objection by the agency to continuing the stay in this case, we find, under the limited circumstances here presented, that the interests of justice seem to require that the stay should be, and it therefore is, extended until the <span class="Italic">final</span> disposition of the criminal case against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1099, 1103-04 (Ct.

DHS</span>, NY-0752-14-0361-I-1, n.8 (NP 10/24/2022) ("However, the pendency of a judicial appeal of a criminal conviction will not ordinarily result in continuing a stay of Board proceedings. The appropriate standard is whether the interests of justice seem to require such action, after balancing the appellant's strong interest in postponing Board proceedings until the criminal charge against him is fully resolved against any prejudice to the agency in waiting an indeterminate amount of time to bring the Board proceedings to a close. The interests of justice in this case did not require a stay in this case until all criminal appeals are exhausted. The appellant did not indicate that the appellate court review of his criminal conviction is <span class="Italic">de novo</span> rather than on the record, and concurrent Board proceedings will not improperly interfere with the court's review.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board also provided guidance in <span class="Italic">Rice v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 317, 320 n.1 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly stated that it is improper to force an accused employee to participate in an administrative appeal proceeding without his consent when serious, related criminal charges are pending and that it is appropriate to stay the Board's proceedings pending completion of an ongoing criminal prosecution involving charges which are closely linked with the charges that form the basis of the appealed agency action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keay v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 331, 335-37 (1993), described the availability of limited stays to permit completion of some discovery during pendent criminal proceedings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In<span class="Italic"> Afro-Lecon, Inc. v. United States</span>, 820 F.2d 1198, 1203-04 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized the potential harm to the prosecution of the criminal case, as well as to the criminal defendant, which may result from the broad scope of civil discovery, in contrast to criminal "discovery." It further noted that postponement of civil proceedings is "desirable...for the protection of the integrity of two separate processes," citing <span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1099, 1103 (Ct. Cl. 1975). 820 F.2d at 1204. We therefore find that such a consideration must enter into the stay determination, even if it does not directly affect the presentation of the agency's case on appeal and there is no specific showing that the related criminal case necessarily will be harmed<span class="Italic">. See Pidock</span>, 54 MSPR at 32 (Board proceedings "might" constitute improper <span id="Page_1336"></span>interference); <span class="Italic">Wallington,</span> 42 MSPR at 465 (Board proceedings "could" constitute improper interference). We further find, however, that the extent of the potential harm to the related criminal case and the specificity of that showing would affect the weight given to this factor in determining the stay request. Moreover, the Board may allow certain discovery to continue in particular circumstances, such as to preserve evidence which may otherwise be lost, even though a stay is warranted, or consider the issuance of protective discovery orders if necessary to prevent prejudice, where discovery is allowed to continue<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> 4 Moore's Federal Practice (2nd Ed. 1993) Para. 26.70(2) at 26-463--26-465 (and cases cited therein).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wallington</span>, 42 MSPR at 465, the Board, while acknowledging that it would suspend its proceedings pending the completion of the trial, adopted the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Afro-Lecon</span>, 820 F.2d at 1202--"whether the interests of justice seem to require such action"--for determining whether to stay its proceedings until the final resolution of the appellant's criminal proceedings.[2] We find that, regardless of whether the stay is requested by the appellant or the agency, this standard is generally met where a stay is requested for a reasonable period pending the completion of a related criminal trial, it is unlikely that either party would be prejudiced thereby, and prosecuting authorities have concurred in the stay request to prevent undue interference in ongoing criminal proceedings and have provided specific reasons therefor. We further find that this standard has been met in this appeal and that the administrative judge properly exercised her judgment in granting the discovery stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In determining whether a stay of proceedings or discovery is appropriate, the courts have considered the following factors: (1) the interest of the plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously with the civil action as balanced against the prejudice to the plaintiff (from) delay; (2) the burden on defendants; (3) the convenience to the courts; (4) the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation; and (5) the public interest. <span class="Italic">In re Mid-Atlantic Toyota Antitrust Litigation</span>, 92 F.R.D. 358, 359 (D. Md. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board proceedings will not be inordinately delayed because of the stay. We note that the appellant has not objected to the postponement of the hearing and thus a further delay in discovery proceedings will not significantly affect the expeditious processing of the appeal. When Board proceedings resume, he will have the opportunity to conduct discovery prior to the hearing. Moreover, the length of the stay is for a reasonable period, i.e., until the completion of the trial, and the appellant is free to request reconsideration of the stay if the trial is not completed within a reasonable time. He has not shown prejudice by this delay. As the administrative judge found, his only claim of prejudice, that the informant's memory of the drug transaction would fade, has no basis in fact. There is no indication in the record that the informant will not be available for discovery proceedings because of advanced age, etc., requiring that her testimony be preserved now. Moreover, if the appellant prevails in his appeal, he will be restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. Pidock</span>, 54 MSPR at 31-32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, while the agency has not demonstrated that the presentation of its case would be materially affected by the denial of a stay or that third parties would be affected, the public interest will be affected thereby. As we discuss above, the deputy district attorney submitted a sworn statement that his prosecution may be hindered or otherwise impaired by a continuation of the Board's proceedings. He further stated that the appellant would not be allowed to depose its witnesses prior to trial under Pennsylvania's Rules of Criminal Procedure. The appellant has asserted that the Commonwealth would not be affected by proceeding with Board discovery because the witnesses have already testified at a preliminary hearing. But, he does not deny that he can circumvent, in effect, the limitations on criminal discovery by using the Board's discovery proceedings to depose the Commonwealth's witnesses before trial, even if he has a different attorney representing him on the criminal matter. Nor has he offered to limit his Board discovery to that permitted under the Commonwealth's Criminal Procedure Rules. Therefore, instead of the Commonwealth seeking to gain an unwarranted advantage, we find that the appellant is more likely to do so by deposing the agency's witnesses in advance of his criminal trial.[3] <span class="Italic">See Peden</span>, 512 F.2d at 1103-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We find the appellant's assertion, that allowing the Commonwealth's attorney to interfere with his Board appeal constitutes a denial of due process and a denial of his right to a fair hearing, to lack merit. As we note above, the Board may properly consider the effect on the prosecution of the related criminal case in connection with the stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that duplicative efforts in connection with the Board's proceedings may be avoided by the stay and that the appellant will not be burdened by the stay since he will be able to defend himself in the criminal proceedings without prosecuting his Board appeal at the same time. Accordingly, we find that the interests of the parties require the Board to grant the stay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One appeal was DWOP'd over the objection of an appellant whose case was joined with those of two other individuals appealing removals interrelated with concurrent criminal proceedings for the three appellants. The appellant argued that her case should have proceeded because she was unemployed and would suffer economic detriment by further delay in the Board proceedings. The agency pointed out problems concerning control of documents (in the possession of the U.S. Attorney) and the likely refusal of the co-appellants to testify by assertion of a Fifth Amendment privilege. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 592, 595 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mattison v. VA</span>, DC-0752-16-0350-I-1 (NP 7/15/2016) ("The Board addressed an analogous situation in <span class="Italic">Henderson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 592, 596-97 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, an administrative judge dismissed a removal appeal without prejudice pending resolution of criminal charges that were closely linked to the charges underlying the removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 596. On review, the appellant in that case asserted that she was being prejudiced by the agency's failure to turn over discovery materials. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 597. The Board dismissed the argument, noting that the appellant had failed to show how her rights had been affected by this discovery matter during the temporary dismissal of her appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, the appellant's arguments concerning discovery in the instant appeal are unavailing. The appellant has not shown that it was necessary to proceed with discovery during the period of dismissal without prejudice and while his criminal charges were pending. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Keay v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 331, 336 (1993) (recognizing that, in the context of a stay while an appellant's criminal charges were pending, the Board may allow certain discovery to continue in particular circumstances, such as to preserve evidence that may otherwise be lost).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under Board law before <span class="Italic">Wallington</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> due process was violated if an accused person was subjected, without his consent, to an administrative hearing concerning conduct also subject to a serious criminal charge pending against him. His necessary defense in the administrative hearing could disclose his evidence long in advance of the criminal trial and prejudice his defense in the trial. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 10 MSPB 568 (1982). But if the appellant proceeded through the hearing without objection and without a request for a continuance necessitated by pending criminal proceedings, no error occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bilger v. DOJ</span>, 33 MSPR 602, 609 (1987) (any right to secure the postponement of a hearing may be waived if the appellant proceeds with the hearing with knowledge of a criminal investigation); <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 12 MSPR 23, 25 (1982) (appellant was not compelled to testify and no adverse inference was drawn from his silence). An appellant was also justifiably concerned with the prejudicial effect of collateral estoppel that arises under <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. DLA</span>, 3 MSPR 171, 3 MSPB 273 (1980), following a criminal conviction and an adverse action involving the same offense. For those reasons, an adverse action hearing was to be stayed, on appellant's motion, pending the disposition of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney into criminal charges closely linked with the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Requiring an appellant to defend a case administratively during a pending criminal investigation would cause him to risk self-incrimination if he testified, or infliction of an adverse inference if he did not--results that could improperly interfere with the criminal investigation, <span class="Italic">Green v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]ourts have found that suspension of administrative proceedings was proper where the employee was the subject of a criminal proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Peden v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Peden, supra,</span> the court noted that freezing the administrative proceeding was proper because it not only protected the employee, but also arose out of a "sense that deferable civil proceedings constitute improper interference with the criminal proceedings if they churn over the same evidentiary material." <span class="Italic">See also Luigi</span> <span class="Italic">Goldstein, Inc. v.

Under the facts of this case, a continuing Board proceeding could constitute improper interference with the ongoing criminal investigation concerning the same conduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 66 MSPR 204, 208 (1995) ("[I]t is the Board's policy to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v.

<p class="Body-Text">In an earlier case, an AJ properly denied a further continuance, after twice <span id="Page_1337"></span>continuing the hearing, when related criminal proceedings were not concluded.

Rice</span>, involving an appeal originally DWOP'd pending the outcome of a criminal case, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's motion for an extension of the dismissal agreement was a refiling of his appeal with a motion for a continuance because the criminal case had not been completely disposed of. <span class="Italic">See Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban</span> <span class="Italic">Development,</span> 42 MSPR 93, 97 (1989) (pleadings will be interpreted liberally, especially when an appellant is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed.

United States,</span> 820 F.2d 1198, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 1987). A court may at its discretion so stay proceedings when the interests of justice seem to require such action. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> It is the Board's policy to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending. However, the pendency of a judicial appeal of a criminal conviction will not ordinarily result in a continuation of the stay of Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Wallington v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 42 MSPR 462, 465-66 (1989). The appropriate standard is whether the interests of justice seem to require such action, after balancing the appellant's strong interest in postponement of Board proceedings until the criminal charge against him is fully resolved against any prejudice to the agency in waiting an indeterminate amount of time to bring the Board proceedings to a close. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the interests of justice do not require a stay in this case until all criminal appeals are exhausted. The appellant has not indicated that the appellate court review of his criminal conviction is <span class="Italic">de novo</span> rather than on the record, and concurrent Board proceedings will not improperly interfere with the court's review. Moreover, the agency, in contrast to the agency in <span class="Italic">Wallington</span>, has consistently opposed the appellant's attempts to extend the dismissal agreement. We note, as we did in <span class="Italic">Wallington</span>, that the pendency of a judicial appeal of a criminal conviction does not ordinarily suspend an agency's otherwise appropriate application of collateral estoppel to prove its charges before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Wallington,</span> 42 MSPR at 466; <span class="Italic">Lively v. Department of the Navy,</span> 31 MSPR 318, 321 (1986). Therefore, we DENY the appellant's motion for a continuance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Normally an AJ should not dismiss an appeal from an indefinite suspension pending trial, for the suspension is not based on misconduct but on an indictment. <span class="Italic">Levenson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 38 MSPR 292, 296 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 623, 624 (1984) ("While an indefinite suspension might be proper on the basis of the indictment, it would not be properly imposed for the misconduct itself.... Therefore, the appeal of an indefinite suspension should not generally be dismissed pending trial."). The Board elaborated on the distinction between removal and indefinite suspensions, <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 362, 363-64 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In dismissing the instant appeal without prejudice, the administrative judge relied upon...<span class="Italic">Wallington</span>...distinguishable from the present indefinite suspension appeal, however, because it pertains to a removal action. In fact, the <span class="Italic">Wallington</span> decision relies upon the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS,</span> 16 MSPR 203, 205 (1983), where the Board specifically noted the distinction between removal actions and indefinite suspensions, where concurrent criminal proceedings exist....&#8197;[I]ndefinite suspensions based upon reasonable cause to believe the employee is guilty of a crime, and pending examination into criminal charges, have been approved by courts because of the dangers of subjecting an employee to an administrative hearing on the merits of alleged criminal misconduct while criminal charges are pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge therefore erred in dismissing the appeal on this basis, and we find that a remand for a determination on the merits of the agency action is required. On remand, the administrative judge should again explore the possibility of conducting a hearing, including informing the appellant of the various ways that hearings can be adjusted to accommodate the parties [referring to the possible status of the appellant being incarcerated] ....&#8197;The administrative judge should also inform the appellant that unreasonable objection to the various ways the Board can accommodate a hearing request may be deemed an implied waiver of the appellant's right to a hearing....&#8197;Further, depending upon the appellant's circumstances at the time the administrative judge receives this case on remand, the administrative judge may also consider continuing the case in lieu of dismissal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Moore</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Rittgers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 117 MSPR 182, 185-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2011 MSPB 101 (2011), coming to the Board on a PFR asserting that the AJ improperly dismissed an indefinite suspension appeal without prejudice to refile upon the conclusion of a criminal investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the investigation has been ongoing since September 15, 2009, and that the delay in processing his appeal has become an economical and psychological burden on him and his family....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Wallington</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 463, the agency removed the appellant based on charges of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, making false statements under oath in matters of official interest, and associating with persons connected with criminal activities. The appellant filed a Board appeal, informed the Board that he had been charged with two criminal misdemeanors, and moved that any further action in the appeal be stayed until the court disposed of the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency did not oppose the motion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 463-64. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice, subject to refiling within 20 days after the criminal charges were dismissed or resolved, because the criminal charges arose from the same incident that formed the basis of the removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464. On review, the appellant indicated that, although he was convicted of one of the criminal misdemeanor charges and found not guilty of the other, he had not yet been sentenced and he intended to file a motion for a new trial and, if necessary, an appeal of the conviction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant argued that his constitutional rights would be violated if he was required to proceed before the Board without having exhausted his remedies in the courts. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The agency did not object to an extension of the stay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board held that staying its appellate proceedings under such circumstances "recognizes that continuing the Board's proceedings could constitute improper interference with the ongoing criminal case concerning the same conduct," and that, although the U.S. Constitution does not ordinarily require a stay of civil proceedings pending the outcome of criminal proceedings, the applicable standard in determining whether to stay a civil proceeding pending the outcome of criminal proceedings is whether the interests of justice seem to require such action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464-65. In applying that standard, the Board balanced the appellant's strong interest in postponement of the proceedings until the criminal charge was fully resolved against the possible prejudice to the agency in having to wait an indeterminate amount of time to bring the Board proceedings to a conclusion, and found that, in the absence of any objection by the agency to continuing the stay, the interests of justice "under the limited circumstances here presented" required that the stay be extended. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 465-66.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Acree</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 121, the agency removed the appellant on the ground that he allegedly traded in national bank stock options based on non-public information that he obtained from his employment. On appeal, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal without prejudice to refiling because the Department of Justice was considering whether to bring a criminal action against the appellant for reasons the same as or similar to those that formed the basis for the removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After the appellant timely refiled his appeal and the administrative judge again dismissed it without prejudice to refiling, the appellant again refiled his appeal, but the administrative judge this time dismissed it as untimely refiled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 121-22. In finding that the appellant timely refiled his appeal and vacating the initial decision, the Board noted generally that "[T]he Board's policy is to stay its proceedings when criminal proceedings involving the same matter are pending." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 122-23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 362 (1992), the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant based upon his federal criminal indictment for unlawfully disclosing tax return information. The Board vacated the initial decision that had dismissed the appeal without prejudice, specifically finding the appellant had opposed dismissal of the appeal and distinguishing <span class="Italic">Wallington</span> because it had involved the appeal from a removal action, not an indefinite suspension as in <span class="Italic">Moore</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 363. Emphasizing the distinction between removal actions and indefinite suspensions when concurrent criminal proceedings exist, the Board found that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal without prejudice to refiling pending resolution of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also found that a remand for a determination on the merits of the agency indefinite suspension action was required. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this appeal is more akin to <span class="Italic">Moore</span> than to <span class="Italic">Wallington</span> and <span class="Italic">Acree</span>. An indefinite suspension based on the crime exception does not generally involve a determination on the merits of the alleged misconduct or any criminal charge, but is valid when: (1) There is reasonable cause to believe the employee committed a crime for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed; (2) the suspension has an ascertainable end; (3) there is a nexus between the alleged misconduct and the efficiency of the service; and (4) the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Dalton v. Department of Justice</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 429, 435 (1995); <span class="Italic">see Pararas-Carayannis v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955, 957-58 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Harding v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 284, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-22 (2010). Therefore, a conflict with an appellant's due process rights is not necessarily created simply because criminal charges are pending and an appellant must defend against an indefinite suspension related to the alleged criminal misconduct. Moreover, in this case the administrative judge granted the <span class="Italic">agency's</span> request for a second dismissal without prejudice over the appellant's express objection. Given <span id="Page_1338"></span>the Congressional directive that the Board expeditiously process appeals because delays adversely affect employees who might be unemployed while their appeals are pending, as a matter of policy an agency's request for a dismissal without prejudice generally should not be granted over an appellant's objection. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 218, 220-21 (1991). Accordingly, because the instant appeal involves an indefinite suspension and the appellant opposed the second dismissal without prejudice, the initial decision incorrectly granted the agency's requested dismissal. A remand for a determination on the merits of the agency's indefinite suspension action is required. <span class="Italic">See Moore</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 363-64.</p>
