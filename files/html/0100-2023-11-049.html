<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-50"><span class="space">a.</span> Past Misconduct</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Discussion of the role of evidence of past misconduct was provided in <span class="Italic">Carrick v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 280, 283 (1995), involving charges of sleeping on duty and determining that the evidence should relate to the appellant's propensity for telling the truth:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...One of the reasons the administrative judge gave for believing the agency's witnesses and for disbelieving the appellant, however, was the appellant's prior history of sleeping on the job. Although there is nothing improper in considering the appellant's prior misconduct in determining the appropriateness of the current penalty...or in impeaching her credibility, if the misconduct had anything to do with her propensity for telling the truth, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Christensen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 681, 688 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 979 F.2d 216 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 459 (1987), the administrative judge's reliance on evidence of the appellant's previous discipline for sleeping on the job as proof that she slept on the job on this occasion was error. In <span class="Italic">Ibrahim v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 531, 536 (1986), the Board, looking to the Federal Rules of Evidence for guidance, stated that "[T]he basic rule is that character evidence may not be introduced circumstantially to prove the conduct of the witness." <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Evid. 404(a). In that case, the administrative judge relied on the appellant's contentious behavior during the hearing to infer that the agency's charges of insubordination were true. The Board held that the administrative judge's reliance on such character evidence to prove the truth of the charges "constituted a basic error in his legal analysis..." and remanded the case for a new hearing. 30 MSPR at 536. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Cummings v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 MSPR 17, 22 (1991). Remand is not warranted here, however, because the administrative judge relied on additional factors to support his credibility findings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alexander v. USPS,</span> CH-0752-09-0737-I-1 (NP 3/3/2011), also considered evaluation of past acts in assessing truthfulness of the appellant's testimony:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While prior bad acts typically cannot be used as proof of the commission of a charged offense, and the parties stipulated that the proposed removal dealt solely with the appellant's conduct towards the complaining witness, the question of whether or not the appellant had previously made comments of a sexual nature is central to the question of whether he was honest in his testimony before the Board in light of his testimony discussed above. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 132, &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (prior conduct may not be used to prove that an employee engaged in misconduct on another occasion, or as a credibility determinant unless the prior conduct reflects on the witness' propensity for telling the truth); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DeFord</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 98, 101 (1985) (if a witness is found to have made a false statement under oath, the trier of fact has every right to distrust the witness, although he is not required to do so); <span class="Italic">Lacapurcia v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 514, 518 n.4 (1985) (if a witness has testified falsely under oath, her credibility as a witness is suspect). Thus, the administrative judge erred when he failed to address the considerable indications that the appellant was untruthful under oath. That error seriously undermines the administrative judge's credibility determination because, as discussed below, we find that the appellant did testify falsely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board discounted the significance of past misconduct to discredit a <span id="Page_1474"></span>witness if the past misconduct did not implicate the credibility of the witness, <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 73 MSPR 397, 402-03 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sustaining Specification A, the AJ found that Carolyn Perry, the appellant's supervisor, testified that the appellant committed the alleged misconduct set forth therein, while the appellant "denied being insolent and rude."...&#8197;The AJ further based his credibility determination on "the fact that the appellant appears to be predisposed to rude and disruptive conduct toward his supervisor, as reflected in the prior disciplinary action that has been administered in his case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that the AJ should not have relied on the prior disciplinary actions and the other sustained specifications to find his testimony less credible than Perry's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Carrick v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 280, 283, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 69 F.3d 555 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), a case that involved a charge of sleeping on duty, two agency witnesses testified that the appellant was sleeping or looked like she was sleeping, while the appellant denied that she was sleeping. One of the reasons the AJ gave for believing the agency's witnesses and disbelieving the appellant was the appellant's prior history of sleeping on the job. On review, the Board found that, although there is nothing improper in considering the appellant's prior misconduct in determining the appropriateness of the current penalty, or in impeaching her credibility if the misconduct had anything to do with her propensity for telling the truth, the AJ erred when he relied on the appellant's prior discipline for sleeping on the job as proof that she slept on the job on the charged occasion. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Citing to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Ibrahim v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 30 MSPR 531, 536 (1986), which in turn had looked to the Federal Rules of Evidence for guidance, the Board reasoned that character evidence may not be introduced circumstantially to prove the conduct of the witness. <span class="Italic">Carrick</span>, 67 MSPR at 283.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the circumstances in this appeal are similar to those in <span class="Italic">Carrick.</span> Therefore, the AJ should not have relied on the appellant's prior discipline for "rude and disruptive" conduct in making a credibility determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hawkins</span> added, 73 MSPR at 404-05:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[F]or the same reasons that the AJ should not have relied on the appellant's prior discipline for similar misconduct in making his credibility determinations with respect to Specification A, the AJ should not have relied on the other unspecified occasions, related by Rogue in her affidavit and testimony, in which the appellant was allegedly abusive, unprofessional, and disruptive. <span class="Italic">Cf. Carrick</span>, 67 MSPR at 283; Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith); Fed. R. Evid. 608(b) (specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness' credibility, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence).[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Rule 405(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which sets forth methods of proving character, provides that, "[I]n cases in which character or a trait of character of a person is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense, proof may also be made of specific instances of that person's conduct." In this appeal, the appellant's character for insolence and rudeness is not an "essential element" of the agency's charge. In other words, the agency did not charge the appellant with having an insolent and rude character generally. Rather, the charge is based on specific instances of conduct that the agency alleges constitute insolence and rudeness. Rule 405(b), therefore, is not instructive in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 Christopher B. Mueller &#x0026; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence &#x00A7; 122 (1994) (evidence of specific instances of conduct is permitted under Rule 405(b) when character itself is "of consequence" to the action--an end, and not simply a means to prove something else).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bidnick v. DOJ,</span> AT-0752-14-0060-I-1 (NP 4/15/2015), sustained the AJ's refusal to permit impeachment questions of a management witness based on long-past conduct issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the Branch Chief and the Staff Administrator did not give credible testimony of what they observed during the examination. Regarding the Branch Chief, the appellant argues that he has "credibility and integrity issues," as evidenced by his past disciplinary record, including discipline for failure to report an "incident" to his supervisor in 1998 and for misuse of a government computer in 2002 or 2003. The appellant's attorney attempted to question the Branch Chief about these matters at the hearing, but the administrative judge sustained the agency's objection to that line of questioning. The appellant argues that the administrative judge should have allowed testimony on these issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, not all misconduct that an individual might commit has a bearing on his propensity for telling the truth. <span class="Italic">Cf. Eichner v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (because the appellant's prior misconduct of disrupting operations, distracting employees, and disobeying orders did not involve his propensity for telling the truth, the administrative judge should not have considered it in determining the credibility of the appellant's testimony). It is not apparent to us, and the appellant has not alleged, that the Branch Chief's prior misconduct, which occurred approximately 10 to 15 years before the hearing, involved any sort of falsification or element of deception. Under these circumstances, we find that the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in sustaining the agency's objection to this line of questioning. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. Social Security Administration</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 10 (2010) (an administrative judge has wide discretion to control the proceedings, including the authority to exclude testimony that she believes would be irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(3). Moreover, the appellant has not explained on petition for review what testimony he expected to elicit from the Branch Chief concerning that prior misconduct. Therefore, he has not shown that the administrative judge's ruling prejudiced his substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Walton v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 462, 467 (1991); <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1981) (an administrative judge's procedural error is of no legal consequence unless it is shown to have adversely affected a party's substantive rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Eichner v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 202, 207 &#x00B6; 10 (1999), also rejected an analysis that equated past misconduct with current untruthfulness, unless the past misconduct directly implicates witness credibility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly argues that the administrative judge improperly relied on the appellant's prior misconduct in determining the credibility of his denial of the misconduct at issue. An administrative judge may consider an employee's prior misconduct in order to impeach his credibility only when the prior misconduct involved the employee's propensity for telling the truth. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 73 MSPR 397, 403 (1997). Here, however, the prior misconduct relied on by the administrative judge was the appellant's deliberate disruption of Postal operations, distracting employees, and disobeying direct orders to return to his work unit on February 27, 1996, for which he received a letter of warning and a 14-day suspension. Since this prior misconduct did not involve the appellant's propensity for telling the truth, the administrative judge improperly considered it in determining the credibility of the appellant's testimony. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins,</span> 73 MSPR at 403.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit said of evidence of prior misconduct, <span class="Italic">Young v. DHUD</span>, 706 F.3d 1372, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously held that, while prior misconduct may be considered in determining the appropriateness of a penalty or impeaching credibility where the prior misconduct relates to the propensity for honesty, reliance on prior conduct to prove whether the petitioner engaged in the same conduct on another occasion is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carrick v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 67 M.S.P.R. 280, 283, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 69 F.3d 555 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 132, 138 (M.S.P.B. 1999); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Smithsonian Inst</span>., 73 M.S.P.R. 397, 403 (M.S.P.B. 1997). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ibrahim v. Department of the Army</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 531, 536 (1986), the Board, looking to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a) for guidance, stated that '[T]he basic rule is that character evidence may not be introduced circumstantially to prove the conduct of the witness.' We agree. While the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to Board hearings, we have found them to be a helpful guide to proper hearing practices. <span class="Italic">Yanopoulos v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 796 F.2d 468, 471 (Fed. Cir. 1986). On remand, Mr. Young's past misconduct should not be used to prove charges that have been asserted against him in this case. Mr. Young's identity is not at issue here and the government's reliance on Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to excuse this use of character evidence is without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 84 MSPR 132, 138 &#x00B6; 10 (1999) ("[P]rior conduct may not be used to prove that the appellant engaged in the same type of conduct on another occasion, or as a credibility determinant unless the prior conduct reflects upon the witness' propensity for telling the truth."). In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 673 (1997), the Board explained during a credibility analysis that it considered "the consistency of witnesses' testimony and their truthfulness or lack of it on previous occasions" to be of some significance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. USPS</span>, 183 F.3d 1328 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (following remand, 84 MSPR 607 (1999)), concluded there was nothing objectionable about impeachment of the appellant, charged with engaging in a physical and verbal altercation with a supervisor, through evidence of a falsification of an employment application. A nonprecedential court case concluded that the Board may consider evidence of prior actions by an individual in the assessment of a credibility dispute as to whether a particular similar act occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matthews v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1308) (a charge of sexual harassment). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Vicente v.

R. Evid. 608)). [<span class="Italic">Refer to</span> Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-102.html#sec7-100">Agency Consideration of Past Discipline</a>."]</p>
