<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-167"><span class="space">a.</span> Definition of "Law" Under 5 USC 7106(a)</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7106(a)(2), the exercise of management rights is conditioned on that exercise being in accordance with applicable laws:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;in accordance with applicable laws--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;to hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain employees in the agency, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;to assign work, to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;with respect to filling positions, to make selections for appointments from--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;any other appropriate source; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(D)&#x2003;to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission during emergencies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators may issue awards setting aside agency actions as contrary to statute, regulations, agency guidance or policy statements, and agencies may then seek to set aside those awards as violations of management rights because, among other reasons, they are not based upon the statutory definition of "laws." Government-wide regulations issued by OPM can be enforced, and their enforcement reviewed, through arbitration. Arbitrators often apply external law, including EEO and overtime compensation statutes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Confirming the ability of arbitrators to interpret and apply agency rules in grievance resolution, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 220</span>, 65 FLRA 860, 863 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that arbitrators are empowered to interpret and apply agency rules in the resolution of grievances under the Statute.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 1269, 1275 (1993) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>). When evaluating exceptions asserting that an award is contrary to a governing agency rule or regulation, the Authority will determine whether the award is inconsistent with the plain wording of, or is otherwise impermissible under, the rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Ogden Serv. Ctr., Ogden, Utah</span>, 42 FLRA 1034, 1056-57 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Ogden</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220</span>, FLRA evaluates exceptions to an award construing an agency rule or regulation based on the law as it stood at the time the events of grievance arose, 65 FLRA at 864:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, while the exceptions in this case were pending before the Authority, the General Services Administration (GSA) amended the FTR. <span class="Italic">See </span>75 Fed. Reg. 24434 (May 5, 2010). In particular, the FTR amendments rephrased 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 301-51.6 and, <span class="Italic">for the first time</span>, explicitly limited "official travel" to "[t]ravel under...the direction of a Federal agency." <span class="Italic">See </span>75 Fed. Reg. at 24,435. In amending the FTR, the GSA stated that the newly added definition of "official travel" applied only to "travel performed on and after June 4, 2010[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 24,434, which would not include the grievant's travel at issue here. The Authority has previously held that, in the absence of any indication that amendments to governing legal provisions were intended to be applied retroactively, the Authority should apply the <span id="page_1949"></span>pre-amended versions of those provisions, as they existed when events gave rise to the grievance, in order to determine whether an award is consistent with the applicable legal standard. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Ctr.</span>, 53 FLRA 34, 38 n.1 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Mines</span>) (applying pre-amended version of statute to evaluate whether award was contrary to law). As the final rule amending the FTR makes clear that retroactive application is not warranted, <span class="Italic">see </span>75 Fed. Reg. at 24434, and consistent with <span class="Italic">Bureau of Mines</span>, 53 FLRA at 38 n.1, we do not rely upon the amended FTR in our evaluation of the Agency's exceptions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 65 FLRA 356, 360 (2010) (in light of explanation of Office of Personnel Management explanation that its regulatory amendments should not have retroactive effect, Authority declined to apply amendments retroactively when determining whether award was contrary to law). As discussed above, under the pre-amended version of the FTR, the Arbitrator's findings satisfy the FTR requirement--as it is incorporated by Agency rules--that the Card be used only for "official travel related expenses."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v53/53-021.html">53 FLRA 146</a>, 152-53 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>), explained how FLRA assesses an exception arguing that an award violates law, as expressed in statute or regulation, by infringing statutory management rights established by 5 USC 7106:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A]n arbitration award that affects management rights under section 7106(a)(2) may provide a remedy only for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b).[8]...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;When an arbitrator has enforced a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement that constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we apply the analysis of <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>), to determine whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B). Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, an arbitrator's enforcement of an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) is not contrary to management rights unless the enforcement would abrogate the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">The regulation may be government-wide. See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, National Park Service and FOP, Park Police Committee</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-212.html">71 FLRA 1121</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (award permitting officers to avoid paying fines for traffic or parking offenses while they used GOVs was contrary to GSA government-wide regulations imposing personal responsibility, with exceptions, for payment; an arguable past practice of not requiring payments did not cure the violation of the contrary regulation) (recon. den., <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-19.html">72 FLRA 103</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester dissenting)).<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 1441 and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, St. Paul Dist.</span>, 61 FLRA 201, 206 (2005), involving a RIF of a seasonal employee, noted that the term "law" includes agency regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, an award affecting management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute will satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> if it provides a remedy for a violation of an applicable law. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I.</span>, 55 FLRA 687, 690-91 (1999), <span class="Italic">decision after remand</span>, 56 FLRA 938 (2000). The Arbitrator was enforcing, among other things, the RIF regulations set forth in 5 C.F.R. Part 451. Thus, if those regulations constitute "applicable laws" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), then prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> is satisfied.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Member Pope notes that the Authority has never held in any context that the term "applicable laws" includes laws that are not relevant to the management right being addressed. The concurrence's statement to the contrary reflects a complete misreading of NTEU, 42 FLRA 377, 389 (1991) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993), where the Authority held that the term "applicable laws" includes "but is not limited to, relevant provisions of the United States Code or other lawfully enacted statutes," only in clarifying that the term also includes other applicable provisions of "law in it's generic sense," including controlling judicial decisions and regulations having the force and effect of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a regulation is an applicable law where that regulation has "the force and effect of law<span class="Italic">." Id.</span> at 690. Regulations have the force and effect of law where they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedure requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first requirement--that a regulation affects individual rights--is satisfied where the regulation is mandatory and establishes the obligations of agencies and the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 351, the regulations concerning RIF, include mandatory provisions and establish the obligations of agencies and the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.204 ("Each agency covered by this part is responsible for following and applying the regulations in this part when the agency determines that a reduction in force is necessary[&#8197;]"); &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.701-351.705 (setting forth employees' "bump and retreat" rights). Accordingly, 5 C.F.R. Part 351 satisfies the first requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the second requirement, there is an explicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress for OPM to enact RIF regulations. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3502(a) provides, in pertinent part: "The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations for the release of competing employees in a reduction in force...." Thus, the second requirement is met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with regard to the third requirement, the current version of 5 C.F.R. Part 351 resulted from notice-and-comment rulemaking. <span class="Italic">See</span> 51 Fed. Reg. 318-01. There is no assertion, and no basis for concluding, that the regulations in Part 351 were not promulgated in conformance with any procedure requirements imposed by Congress. Accordingly, there is no basis for finding that the third requirement is not met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the regulations set forth in 5 C.F.R. Part 351 are applicable laws within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. Consequently, the award satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The governing regulation may be an agency's own regulation if the regulation is not contrary to the provisions of the negotiated agreement, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU Chap. 149</span>, 66 FLRA 626, 629-30 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For purposes of determining whether an award is contrary to law, rule, or regulation under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute, the term "regulation" includes governing agency regulations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed.

The Authority has found that directives constitute agency-wide regulations. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Def., Dependents Sch.</span>, 54 FLRA 259, 266 (1998) (indicating that the Authority has, on numerous occasions, defined the term "regulation" as encompassing directives); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Office of Dependents Sch., Ger. Region</span>, 48 FLRA 979, 985 (1993) (finding that a directive constituted a governing agency-wide regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, even assuming the Agency's interpretation of the 2007 directive is entitled to deference, the Agency has not established that the award is contrary to that interpretation.<span class="Italic"> </span>An award is deficient if it is inconsistent with a "governing" agency regulation. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Cent.

Although collective bargaining agreements, rather than agency-wide regulations, govern the disposition of matters to which they both apply, <span class="Italic">e.g., VA</span>, 55 FLRA at 629, there is no contention that the parties' agreement governs this dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 65 FLRA 13, 15-17 (2010) (Member Beck, dissenting), reviewing an arbitration award, the question was whether management rights were infringed when an arbitrator enforced the agency's merit assignment program ("MAP") when he overturned a merit selection decision. The MAP was an "applicable law," and there was no violation of management rights:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions that contend that an award is contrary to a management right, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of a right set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a). The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 558 (1999). The right to select under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) includes the right to determine the qualifications needed to perform the work of a position and to determine whether applicants possess such qualifications. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 339, 343 (2000). In this case, the Arbitrator concluded that the selecting official's determination that the grievant did not meet the qualifications for the position was improper. By precluding the selecting official from determining whether the grievant was qualified, the award affects management's rights to assign work and to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both parties acknowledge that, if the MAP constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), then the award is not deficient. However, the parties dispute whether the MAP constitutes an applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A regulation constitutes an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) when it has "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 390-91 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds, </span>996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Regulations have the force and effect of law when they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 391-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has considered whether agency regulations constitute an <span id="page_1950"></span>applicable law under the <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>requirements in three cases: <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Academy, Colo. Springs, Colo.</span>, 59 FLRA 888 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to another matter); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Missile Command, Army Commc'ns Command Agency, Redstone Arsenal, Ala.</span>, 59 FLRA 154 (2003) (then-Member Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I.</span>, 55 FLRA 687 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>). In <span class="Italic">Air Force </span>and <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the Authority held that the regulations had the force and effect of law and constituted applicable laws. In <span class="Italic">Army</span>, the Authority held that there was no basis on which to conclude that the agency regulation had the force and effect of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, the Authority held that the agency's Performance Appraisal Review System (PARS) regulation met all three <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>requirements. 55 FLRA at 691. The Authority first concluded that PARS affected individual rights and obligations, noting that a regulation affects individual rights when it is mandatory and establishes obligations of agencies and rights of employees. The Authority found that PARS obligated the agency to conduct the performance appraisal process in a certain manner and affected the right of employees to obtain a particular rating. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 690. The Authority further concluded that PARS was promulgated pursuant to an explicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress because, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, each agency is required to establish certain performance appraisal systems and PARS stated that it was developed under this authority. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 690-91. As to the third requirement, the Authority explained that, to meet this requirement, the regulation must be promulgated in accordance with applicable statutory procedures and be within the scope of delegated duties. The Authority acknowledged that, to be validly promulgated under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), many regulations must be published through notice of the proposed rule in the Federal Register with an opportunity for interested parties to comment. However, the Authority noted the exception set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(a)(2) to the notice and comment requirements of the APA for agency rulemaking involving a matter related to agency management or personnel. The Authority found that PARS was excepted from the notice and comment requirements under &#x00A7; 553(a)(2) and was otherwise promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements of law, regulation and OPM policy. Accordingly, the Authority concluded that PARS was promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 691.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, the Authority held that Air Force Instruction (AFI) 38-203, which pertained to procurement and contracting out, met all three <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>requirements. 59 FLRA at 893. The Authority first concluded that AFI-28-203 affected individual rights and obligations because it was mandatory for contracting-out studies and established the obligations of the agency and the right of employees as they pertained to such studies. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 891. The Authority further concluded that AFI-38-203 was promulgated pursuant to a delegation of legislative authority by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 892. Finally, the Authority concluded that AFI 38-203 was promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 892-93.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Army</span>, the arbitrator specifically cited MICOM 690-12.5 and 690-28.11, agency regulations pertaining to promotion. The Authority concluded that the citations did not constitute express findings that the agency violated the regulations. However, assuming that the arbitrator implicitly found that the agency violated the regulations, the Authority determined that "there [wa]s no evidence or assertion that either regulation constitute[d] an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute." 59 FLRA at 156.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, there is no dispute that the MAP is mandatory and that it establishes the obligations of the Agency and the rights of employees with respect to promotions and assignments within the Agency. Accordingly, the first requirement of <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>is satisfied. As to the second requirement, Congress has expressly authorized OPM to prescribe rules governing the competitive service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302. Consistent with this authority, OPM has promulgated rules governing agency promotion and placement programs from which the MAP specifically states that it is derived. MAP Section I (Purpose); Section III (Authority). In this regard, the express purpose of the MAP is to assure that employees receive equitable consideration for promotion and placement solely on merit and fitness. MAP Section I. Accordingly, the second requirement is satisfied because the MAP is consistent with, and derived from, authorized OPM-imposed requirements. <span class="Italic">See Navy</span>, 55 FLRA at 690-91. As to the third requirement, &#x00A7; 553(a)(2) excepts matters relating to agency management and personnel from the notice and comment requirements of the APA. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 691. As a matter relating to agency management and personnel, the promulgation of the MAP was excepted from the notice and comment requirements of the APA. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>The Agency does not contend that the MAP was not promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements of law and OPM rules and policy. Moreover, the Agency maintains that the MAP is a binding regulation that governs the disposition of this matter. Accordingly, the third requirement is satisfied. The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Army </span>does not establish otherwise because, unlike that case, the Union specifically asserts, and the record supports, that, under Authority precedent, the MAP has the force and effect of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly<span class="Italic">, </span>we conclude that the MAP constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). As the effect on management's rights is based on the Arbitrator's enforcement of such applicable law, the Agency fails to establish that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a). Consequently, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The earliest decision relied on in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243</span> was <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. and NAGE, FUSE</span>, 55 FLRA 687, 690-91 (1999) (following a remand to an arbitrator, 56 FLRA 938 (2000)). The arbitrator required the agency to raise the level of the grievant's performance rating as a result of the agency's isolation of its Performance Appraisal Review System ("PARS"). FLRA considered whether the remedy was consistent with the requirement in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU Chap. 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997), that there be a finding either of a violation of applicable law within &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) or a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). FLRA concluded that the PARS was an applicable law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's appraisal of the grievant violated the Agency's PARS regulation. If the PARS regulation constitutes either an "applicable law" or a contract provision within the scope of 7106(b) of the Statute, then Prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that a regulation is an "applicable law" where that regulation has "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 42 FLRA 377, 391-92 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds,</span> 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>). Regulations are found to have the force and effect of law where they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This test is similar to the test used by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to determine whether agency regulations have the force and effect of law. <span class="Italic">See Hamlet v. United States,</span> 63 F.3d 1097, 1105 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Hamlet</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 517 U.S. 1155 (1996).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In particular, <span class="Italic">Hamlet,</span> 63 F.3d at 1105, sets out a four-part test for determining whether an agency's personnel regulation has the force and effect of law. Under this test, the court asks whether the promulgating agency: (1) was vested with the authority to create the regulation; (2) conformed to procedural requirements, if any, in promulgating the regulation; and (3) intended the provision to establish a binding rule. The court also determines whether the regulation contravenes a statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first requirement--that a regulation affects individual rights--has been determined to be satisfied where the regulation is mandatory and establishes the obligations of agencies and the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 42 FLRA at 391. The Federal Circuit, in determining whether an agency regulation is mandatory, examines the language of the provision, its context, and "any other extrinsic evidence of intent." <span class="Italic">Hamlet,</span> 63 F.3d at 1103-1105. Here, the PARS regulation's purpose is "[t]o establish policy and responsibilities for the...performance appraisal system[.]" The regulation sets out requirements for supervisors and employees with respect to performance plans, appraisals and ratings, and provides specific summary ratings that are associated with particular levels of ratings on performance elements. On their face, the regulations oblige the agency to conduct the performance appraisal process in a particular manner and affect the rights of individual employees to obtain a particular summary performance rating. The Agency has provided no argument or reason that would indicate that the regulations are not the binding rules they purport to be, and we find that the PARS regulation affects individual rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, there is an explicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress to create performance appraisal systems. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302, each agency is required to establish performance appraisal systems that conform to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulation and contain specific features. The PARS regulation explicitly states that it was developed under this authority. <span class="Italic">See </span>PARS Regulation at &#x00A7; 5(d). The terms of the Agency's PARS regulation include the features required by the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the PARS regulation was promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, for an agency rule to have the force and effect of law, it must be validly promulgated in accordance with applicable statutory procedures and be within the scope of delegated duties. 1 Stein, Mitchell, Mezines, Administrative Law &#x00A7; 1.02[2], at 1-48-1-49 (1999). Many agency regulations must be published through notice of the proposed rule in the Federal Register, providing interested parties an opportunity for comment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b). However, section 553(a)(2) of title 5 excepts agency rulemaking from the notice and comment requirement to the extent that it involves <span id="page_1951"></span>"a matter relating to agency management or personnel[.]" In applying this exception, several courts have held that an agency manual or handbook can be a regulation with the force and effect of law, despite not being published for notice and comment. <span class="Italic">See Hamlet,</span> 63 F.3d at 1103-05, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles,</span> 354 U.S. 363 (1957); <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Piccone v. United States,</span> 407 F.2d 866 (1969).[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hamlet</span> also discussed precedent where courts found that agency regulations did not create enforceable rights. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1104-05. In reaching these conclusions, the courts held that the disputed regulation was precatory, rather than mandatory, <span class="Italic">see Griessenauer v. Department of Energy,</span> 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985); that the provision was intended to "establish a policy" rather than "create any rights," <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 812 F. 2d 705, 711 (Fed Cir. 1987); or that the provision was an "interpretive," rather than a "substantive" rule, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Jeffrey,</span> 823 F.2d 1512, 1528-30 (Fed. Cir. 1987). These decisions do not relate to the procedural regularity of the regulations at issue, but to the intent of the agency promulgating the particular regulation, an issue discussed above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only requirements placed on agency performance appraisal systems under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 are that they must include specific substantive matters and be promulgated under the regulations that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) prescribes. The OPM regulations, in turn, require that an agency must submit a description of its appraisal system to OPM for approval. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.209.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's award does not state whether the Agency's PARS regulation was approved by OPM. However, in an unpublished decision of the Federal Circuit, the court stated that the Agency's PARS regulation was approved by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Woodward v. Department of the Navy,</span> 99 F.3d 1160, 1996 WL 599796, *2 (Fed. Cir. 1996). We also note that it appears from the record that the Agency's PARS regulation, dated August 17, 1993, has been in effect for over five years. Section 430.210 of 5 C.F.R. provides that if OPM determines that an appraisal system "does not meet the requirements of applicable law, regulation, or OPM policy, it shall direct the agency to implement an appropriate system or program or take other corrective action." If the Agency's PARS regulation was not initially promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements set forth in law, regulation, or OPM policy, it seems reasonable to expect that corrective action would have already been taken by the Agency at the direction of OPM. We thus find that the PARS regulations was validly promulgated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Agency's PARS regulation is an "applicable law" because it affects individual rights and obligations, was promulgated pursuant to an explicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress and was promulgated in conformance with required procedures. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's application of the Agency's PARS regulation meets prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 243</span> also relied on <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 59 FLRA 154, 156 (2003), involving an award determining that preselection occurred in violation of an agency regulation, MICON 690-28-11, requiring that officials avoid practices that suggested preselection. But FLRA decided that the award failed to meet the first requirement of <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving</span> because the document relied on by the arbitrator did not qualify as a law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if we were to conclude that the Arbitrator implicitly found a violation of either or both of the Agency's regulations, there is no evidence or assertion that either regulation constitutes an applicable law within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. The Union states, without elaboration, that MICOM 690-28 and another Agency regulation not addressed by the Arbitrator were "taken from 5 [C.F.R.] 335." This claim does not assert, let alone demonstrate, that the Agency regulations constitute applicable laws. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record that would lead us to conclude that the Agency regulations constitute "applicable laws" under the criteria established by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that a regulation is an "applicable law" where that regulation has "the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA 377, 391-92 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Regulations are found to have the force and effect of law when they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 392-93. There is no basis in the record on which to conclude that MICOM 690-28.11 or 690-12.5 satisfies these requirements. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Signal Ctr. &#x0026; Ft. Gordon, Ft. Gordon, Ga., </span>58 FLRA 511, 514 (2003) (Member Pope concurring) (Authority set aside an award which failed to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> because, in relevant part, there was no assertion or factual finding to show that the award was enforcing any law).</p>
<p class="noindent">The other decision cited in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapt. 243</span> was <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Academy and AFGE Local 1867</span>, 59 FLRA 888, 890-93 (2004), a ULP that required whether an information request for procurement-related information (used in a contracting-out determination) was prohibited by law from release under 5 USC 7114(b). The "law" relied on by the agency was an Air Force regulation, and FLRA determined that it properly blocked release of the information requested by the union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute, an agency must furnish information to a union, upon request and "to the extent not prohibited by law," if that information is: (1) "normally maintained by the agency"; (2) "reasonably available"; (3) "necessary for full and proper discussion, understanding, and negotiation of subjects within the scope of collective bargaining"; and (4) not "guidance, advice, counsel or training." <span class="Italic">United States DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Forrest City, Ark.,</span> 57 FLRA 808, 812 (2002). In this regard, the only factors disputed before the Judge were whether the TPP was "necessary" for the Union to carry out its representational duties and whether release of the TPP is "prohibited by law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's finding that the release of the TPP is not prohibited by law. More specifically, the Respondent excepts to the Judge's finding that AFI 38-203 is not an agency regulation which has the "force and effect of law." For the reasons discussed below, we find that AFI 38-203 is a regulation with the force and effect of law, which prohibited the release of the TPP at the time of the Union's request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFI 38-203 is an agency regulation which has the "force and effect of law." </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an earlier case involving the release of an MEO, the Authority concluded that the term "law" in &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) of the Statute includes "regulations having the force and effect of law." <span class="Italic">Ft. Knox,</span> 43 FLRA at 493. Regulations have the force and effect of law if they: (1) affect individual rights and obligations; (2) were promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; and (3) were promulgated in conformance with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport R.I.,</span> 55 FLRA 687, 690 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 42 FLRA at 391-92) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>). We address each of these three requirements below.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFI 38-203 affects individual rights and obligations. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In regard to the first requirement, the Authority has held that an agency's regulation affects individual rights and obligations where the regulation is mandatory and it establishes the obligations of the agency and the rights of employees. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy,</span> 55 FLRA at 690; <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 42 FLRA at 391. The AFI is a regulation that is mandatory throughout the Air Force for all contracting out studies. In this regard, the Respondent argues, and neither the GC nor the Union disputes, that the AFI "is an implementing regulation that is required to be implemented by the service secretaries and followed to the letter by the [Agency]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the TPP, AFI 38-203, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11.2.11.3 and 17.2.3 contain substantively identical language. Those provisions state, in mandatory terms, that the TPP "is not releasable to the public" until a final cost comparison decision has been reached and that the TPP "is not released for public review when a tentative cost comparison decision is determined." These paragraphs of the regulation go on to state that the TPP may be releasable after the final cost comparison at the time of the final study, if its release is not likely to adversely affect the competitive position of an in-house offer in a future competition. These clauses do not detract from the mandatory nature of the regulation when, as in this case, a tentative--not a final--decision is made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, it is clear that the regulation establishes the obligations of the Agency and the rights of employees with regard to contracting out studies. In this regard, the regulation seeks to protect the TPP from release where release of the TPP would be "likely to adversely impact the competitive position of a[n] in-house offer in a future acquisition." The regulation protects the individual rights of federal employees by maintaining the confidentiality of contracting out studies so that those employees will not be disadvantaged in future contracting out competitions, which could result in the loss of their jobs. In sum, we find that AFI 38-203 affects individual rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFI 38-203 was promulgated pursuant to a delegation of legislative authority by Congress. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second element, the Respondent argues that AFI 38-203 is based on two parallel lines of authority--OMB Circular A-76 and the FAIR Act. For the reasons discussed below, we find that there is a sufficient nexus between the FAIR Act, that statute's delegation of authority to OMB to issue Circular A-76, and AFI 38-203 to establish the requisite delegation of legislative authority by Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the FAIR Act was "to provide a process for identifying the functions of the Federal Government that are not inherently governmental functions[.]" 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 501 note. The FAIR Act provides an explicit delegation of legislative authority for the Director of 0MB to issue guidance for the competitive process required by the Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 501 note, Sec. 2(d) ("The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue guidance for the administration of this subsection [entitled Competition Required]."). Accordingly, OMB Circular A-76 and its <span id="page_1952"></span>Handbook derive explicit legislative authority from and implement the FAIR Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> OMB Circular A-76 ("3. Authority. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970 (31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1111); Executive Order 11541; the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 405); and the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act of 1998 (31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 501 note).").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the 0MB Circular is a government-wide regulation having the force and effect of law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU,</span> 47 FLRA 304, 306 (1993); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 42 FLRA at 391. OMB Circular A-76 directs agencies to implement the Circular and its Supplement. <span class="Italic">See</span> OMB Circular A-76 &#x00B6; 9.c. ("each agency head shall...[i]mplement this Circular and its Supplement with a minimum of internal instructions."). Accordingly, OMB Circular A-76 represents an implicit delegation of legislative authority for the promulgation of AFI 38-203.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Hamlet v. United States,</span> 63 F.3d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">Hamlet</span>), the court had to determine whether an agency's personnel manual had the force and effect of law. With regard to the requirement that the manual be "promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress[,]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy,</span> 55 FLRA at 690, the court found that this requirement had been satisfied where, as here, the legislative authority from which the manual was derived was regulatory. <span class="Italic">See Hamlet,</span> 63 F.3d at 1105.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, a similar connection exists between the FAIR Act, OMB Circular A-76 and AFI 38-203. In this regard, the FAIR Act authorizes OMB to issue Circular A-76, which in turn directs agencies to implement the Circular through "internal instructions." OMB Circular A-76 &#x00B6; 9.c. Accordingly, we find that AFI 38-203 was promulgated pursuant to an implicit or explicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFI 38-203 was promulgated in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the third element, the Respondent argues that as an implementing regulation of a military department, AFI 38-203 was not required to be promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment requirements of the APA. In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy,</span> the Authority found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b) excepts agency rulemaking from the notice and comment requirement to the extent that it involves "a matter relating to agency management or personnel [.]" 55 FLRA at 691. Section 553(a) also excepts from the notice and comment requirements "a matter relating to...contracts." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(a). AFI 38-203 establishes the rules the Respondent must follow when conducting a contracting out study. As such, the regulation concerns matters relating to contracts and is excepted from the notice and comment requirements of the APA.</p>
<p class="noindent">Concerning the deference due to agency interpretations of agency regulations, FLRA will not disturb an arbitrator's analysis of an agency regulation if the arbitrator's interpretation is consistent with the regulation and the agency's interpretation is publicly articulated prior to the case and does not amount to a litigation position, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 68</span>, 65 FLRA 23, 25-26 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the resolution of grievances under the Statute, arbitrators are empowered to interpret and apply agency rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 48 FLRA 1269, 1275 (1993). In this regard, an agency's prior interpretation of its own regulation is controlling unless it is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent" with the language of the regulation. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Med. Facility for Fed. Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA 1126, 1136 (1996) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">FLRA v. U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Fin. Mgmt. Serv.</span>, 884 F.2d 1446, 1454 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">FLRA v. Treasury</span>)). However, the Authority declines to defer to an agency's "litigative positions." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Treasury</span>, 884 F.2d at 1455)). Accordingly, for an agency's interpretation to be entitled to deference, the interpretation asserted in exceptions must have been publicly articulated prior to "litigation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Nordell v. Heckler</span>, 749 F.2d 47, 48 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). In circumstances where an agency fails to establish that deference is due to its interpretation of its regulation, the Authority independently assesses whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the regulation is consistent with its provisions. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 56 FLRA 627, 630 (2000) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>); <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 51 FLRA at 1137.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Moreover, the Agency provides no evidence that it formally promulgated or otherwise publicly announced its interpretation of the IRM's use of the word "return" prior to the instant dispute. Therefore, the Agency's interpretation of "return" is not entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 1136 (citing <span class="Italic">FLRA v. Treasury</span>, 884 F.2d at 1455); <span class="Italic">cf. United States v. Paddack</span>, 825 F.2d 504 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (Foreign Service Grievance Board did not err in refusing to accord deference to agency's interpretation of regulation issued only after formal grievance litigation was commenced).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in accordance with Authority precedent on <span class="Italic">de novo </span>regulatory interpretation, we independently assess whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of "return" is consistent with the text of the relevant IRM provisions. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 56 FLRA at 630. As mentioned above, the IRM does not define "return." In addition, the IRM expressly recognizes that the Agency may use an employee's temporary-promotion compensation rate to set the employee's pay upon promotion. <span class="Italic">See supra </span>IRM &#x00A7; 6.500.1.4.7(1)(A). In these circumstances, we find no inconsistency between the text of the IRM and the Arbitrator's conclusion that a "return" requires more than a mere paper-record notation. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
