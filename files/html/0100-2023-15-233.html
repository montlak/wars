<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-232"><span class="space">2.</span> Employment Application; Security Questionnaire; Lack of Candor</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Employment applications provide a fertile source of falsification cases. If falsification of an employment application is demonstrated, the misconduct goes to the appellant's reliability, veracity, trustworthiness, and ethical conduct. It affects the efficiency of the service. Removal for lack of candor or false statement in an employment application can come during or after a probationary period. <span class="Italic">Freeland v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1344.OPINION.8-7-2020_1632844.pdf">825 Fed. Appx. 750</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP) ("Mr. Freeland's employment was still subject to a background investigation."). Freeland noted that the charge can be lack of candor, incorporating some element of intent and subject to a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis for the tenured employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Freeland argues that the Board failed to acknowledge that the Agency, in its Removal Notice, accused Mr. Freeland of intentionality. As noted in the Board's decision, a lack of candor does not require "intentionality or an intent to deceive." <span class="Italic">Ludlum</span>, 278 F.3d at 1284-85 (stating that lack of candor involves "a failure to disclose something that, in the circumstances, should have been disclosed to make the statement accurate and complete"). The Board's finding that Mr. Freeland's failure to disclose the unfavorable circumstances regarding his prior employment was enough to support the charge of lack of candor is supported by substantial evidence, regardless of any "intentionality." To the extent Mr. Freeland is arguing that the deciding official failed to analyze the first <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor, "the nature and seriousness of the offense, and its relation to the employee's duties, position, and responsibilities, including whether the offense was intentional or technical or inadvertent, or was committed maliciously or for gain or was frequently repeated," we find the Board's determination that the deciding official did consider such a factor supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin</span>., 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). The record contains the deciding official's analysis of each Douglas factor and the Board heard testimony from the deciding official and credited such testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Freeland also contends that his incorrect answer on the SF-85Ps was not done for "personal gain." However, a finding of lack of candor does not require a finding of personal gain. Additionally, although the Board states that a finding of personal gain would be a "commonsense inference," it notes that the charge was not based on a finding of personal gain. One of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors is personal gain. To the extent Mr. Freeland is arguing the deciding official inappropriately found personal gain in deciding the penalty, we find the Board appropriately weighed the testimony from the deciding official and Mr. Freeland. We see no reason to overturn the Board's credibility determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal for falsification of government documents promotes service efficiency because acts of falsification raise serious doubts regarding the employee's honesty and fitness for employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 52 MSPR 45, 47 (1991). <span class="Italic">Delessio v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 517, 521 (1987), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[R]emoval is a reasonable penalty for employment application falsification....&#8197;This...has been held to be the case in the private sector, especially where, as in this case, there is an explicit proscription of such falsification. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Florida Steel Corporation</span>, 586 F.2d 436, 450 (5th Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Firestone Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 539 F.2d 1335, 1336 n.4 (4th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawes v. OPM,</span> 122 MSPR 341, 350 &#x00B6; 21, 2015 MSPB 29 (2015) (suitability appeal: "A falsification charge includes an element of private material gain. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boo v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 13 (2014). Securing employment is private material gain that will support a falsification charge. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.").</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A case involving questions in application forms seeking to obtain information about past employment history is the suitability appeal of <span class="Italic">McFalls v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3167), sustaining removal for the employee's misstatements concerning the basis of his departure from his prior employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McFalls completed an employment application for an auditor position with the USAAA on April 14, 1999. In the application, he indicated that he was employed as an auditor at the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), even though he had submitted his resignation to HHS one day earlier. Although his resignation was not effective until May 8, 1999, and therefore he was technically still working for HHS, we believe that Mr. McFalls had an affirmative obligation to notify the USAAA, at least after May 8, 1999, that he no longer was employed by HHS. However, Mr. McFalls failed to inform the USAAA of his resignation even during the interview with the USAAA on June 1, 1999. In fact, he told the USAAA that he had resigned from HHS only when a personnel management specialist with the USAAA confronted him on June 2, 1999. Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mr. Mcfalls intended to deceive the USAAA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. McFalls contends that the Board incorrectly decided that he provided false information on Optional Form ("OF") 306, "Declaration for Federal Employment," and Standard Form ("SF") 86, "Questionnaire for National Security Positions," during the appointment process for his position with DFAS. We again disagree; substantial evidence supports the Board's finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The false information on these forms concerned Mr. McFalls' employment history.... With respect to his employment history, Mr. McFalls' supervisor at HHS informed him that his performance was poor and that a letter of removal was being drafted at the agency's headquarters. Mr. McFalls agreed to resign rather than face a possible performance-based termination. He failed to disclose this resignation information on the OF-306 and SF-86 forms, however. Specifically, question 11 on form OF-306 asked: "During the last 5 years, were you fired from any job for any reason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems. In response, Mr. McFalls answered "No." Similarly, question 22 on form SF-86 asked whether during the last seven years, the applicant had "[l]eft a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance." In response, Mr. McFalls did not provide any information regarding his resignation from HHS. In light of these facts, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that by not disclosing information about his resignation from HHS in response to question 11 on OF-306 and question 22 on SF-86, Mr. McFalls provided false information on these forms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Harrison v. USDA</span>, 411 Fed. Appx. 312, 313-15 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), one of a number of the sustained charges in a removal case concerned a response to an inquiry about prior employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second charge was supported by four specifications. All four specifications involved answers Ms. Harrison provided on Optional Form 306 ("OF-306") as part of her employment application with the FSA and on the "electronic questionnaire for investigations processing" form ("e-QIP") that Ms. Harrison filled out during the investigation of the first charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before joining the FSA, Ms. Harrison worked in a similar position with the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") until she was terminated in November of 2004. Following her termination, she appealed to the Board and eventually entered into a settlement agreement with FEMA. The first two specifications relate to her failure to disclose the existence of the settlement agreement. When Ms. Harrison filled out OF-306 on her first day of work with the FSA, she answered "no" to question 12:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During the last 5 years, have you been fired from any job for any reason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, did you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, or were you debarred from Federal employment by the Office of Personnel Management or any other Federal agency?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harrison also responded "no" to a similar question on the e-QIP. Because Ms. Harrison had resigned from her position with FEMA by mutual agreement, the administrative judge concluded that her answers were false and therefore sustained the first two specifications.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the second charge, Ms. Harrison claims that she did not knowingly and intentionally falsify information regarding her employment with FEMA. To prevail on that charge, the agency was required to prove that the statement was false, that it was material, and that the employee acted with the intent to deceive the agency for her private gain. <span class="Italic">Leatherbury v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 524 F.3d 1293, 1301-02 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The settlement agreement between FEMA and Ms. Harrison permitted her to acknowledge that she left her position by mutual agreement. Although FEMA has amended her SF-50 to indicate that she was not removed but left by agreement, that change did not alter her obligation to respond truthfully to the questions relating to separation by mutual agreement. Falsification of federal employment applications is a type of misconduct as to which materiality is presumed. <span class="Italic">See Kissner v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 792 F.2d 133, 134 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Moreover, an intent to defraud can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, such as an applicant's desire not to disclose information that could adversely affect the likelihood of her being hired. Here, the administrative judge considered the record as a whole and Ms. Harrison's explanations as to why she answered the questions the way she did and found that she acted with an intent to deceive the FSA. That finding is supported by substantial evidence; we therefore sustain the Board's decision with respect to the first and second specifications of the falsification charge.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Employees may be charged with intentional deception through employment applications that do not fairly respond to broad questions about whether the appellant departed a prior job under unfavorable circumstances or through mutual agreement as a result of specific problems, as <span class="Italic">Pappas v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 152, 156-60 (1997), a suitability appeal, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In analyzing the suitability determination here, the administrative judge found that the appellant's superior with the NYSP (Lt. Thomas Wood) had informed the appellant that his performance was unacceptable and that Lt. Wood thus planned to recommend his termination; she further found that Lt. Wood had suggested to the appellant that, for his own good and that of the NYSP, he should consider resigning. She concluded that when confronted with his poor performance results and Lt. Wood's anticipated recommendation, the appellant chose to resign rather than pursue any disciplinary matter through. the NYSP's internal review process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge nonetheless found that the appellant had not made an intentionally false or deceptive statement or engaged in criminal or dishonest conduct by failing to disclose the circumstances of his resignation in answering the questions quoted above on the SF-86 and the SF-171. She determined that he had not been fired by the NYSP and had not been told that he would be fired (merely that Lt. Wood had recommended his termination). The administrative judge further found that the appellant had not left his job with the NYSP by mutual agreement because of specific problems or allegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance because the record did not show "an exchange of benefits between the appellant and the NY State Police that would constitute a mutual agreement, particularly in light of the fact that the appellant was later foreclosed from receiving unemployment benefits because he resigned voluntarily." Finally, she concluded that the question on the SF-86 asking whether the appellant had left a job under "unfavorable circumstances" was "inappropriate" because that phrase was "so broad and vague as to be subject to wide interpretation." She therefore found that his "exclusion" of a response to that question was reasonable. The administrative judge thus determined that none of the questions quoted above applied to the appellant's resignation from the NYSP and that they did not require him to describe the circumstances of his resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant had not made an intentionally false or deceptive statement or engaged in criminal or dishonest conduct with respect to this matter. We agree. As noted above, the administrative judge's own undisputed factual findings show that the appellant took advantage of Lt. Wood's suggestion and resigned rather than contest Lt. Wood's presumptive recommendation that he be terminated for unsatisfactory performance; Capt. Wood testified that he made clear to the appellant his opinion that resignation was in the "best interest" of both the appellant and the NYSP. Given this background, it seems clear that the appellant did leave his job because of "specific problems" and "following allegations of unsatisfactory performance," and that the appellant and the NYSP mutually agreed that resignation was his best option under those circumstances. The appellant thus should have disclosed those circumstances in response to questions on the SF-171 and the SF-86, and his failure to do so raises an inference of an intent to deceive<span class="Italic">. See Naekel</span>, 782 F.2d at 978; <span class="Italic">Devitto</span>, 61 MSPR at 302.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, however, the administrative judge found that the appellant had not resigned by "mutual agreement" because he did not obtain unemployment benefits as a result of that resignation and thus had not received the tangible "exchange of benefits" required to support a "mutual agreement." OPM rightly points out, that this reasoning strongly suggests that the administrative judge interpreted "mutual agreement" to mean a contract; under the law of contracts, an enforceable contract does not exist unless it is based on a bargained-for exchange known as "consideration." <span class="Italic">See</span> J.M. Perillo &#x0026; H.H. Bender, Corbin on Contracts, &#x00A7; 5.1 at 2-7 (Rev. ed. 1995). Consideration under the law of contracts, however, is not measured in dollars and cents alone, and courts are not usually disposed to enter upon "nice calculation" of whether consideration is adequate<span class="Italic">. See</span> Corbin on Contracts, &#x00A7; 5.14 at 63-65. A very small consideration (the proverbial "peppercorn") can support an enforceable contract; convenience, avoidance of troublesome details and efforts, and forbearance to institute proceedings against the other party, for example, can be proper elements of consideration<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 65-71. Even under the law of contracts, then, the agreement between the appellant and the NYSP that he should resign might be an enforceable contract supported by sufficient consideration; the NYSP obtained the appellant's departure without termination proceedings, and the appellant avoided the unpleasant prospect of contesting such proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unnecessary, however, to decide whether or not this agreement was binding under the law of contracts. Nothing on the face of the SF-86 or the SF-171 stated or implied that the phrase "mutual agreement" should be interpreted in that way.[7] As support for her interpretation, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Forma v. Department of Justice</span>, 57 MSPR 97, 100, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), as an example of resignation by mutual agreement, where the agency agreed to show that the employee had resigned involuntarily (so that he could receive unemployment benefits) in exchange for his resignation. Review of <span id="Page_2758"></span><span class="Italic">Forma</span>, however, does not disclose that the Board required (either directly or implicitly) an agreement between an employee and his former employing agency regarding a resignation to be supported by consideration under the law of contracts in order to constitute a "mutual agreement." It merely found in that case that an agreement between the employee and the agency existed and that it resulted in his resignation following allegations of unsatisfactory performance. Under those circumstances, the Board held, the appellant should have disclosed on an SF-86 and an SF-171 that he had left his job with that agency by mutual agreement because of a specific problem and following allegations of unsatisfactory performance; it therefore found that the appellant had intentionally given false answers by failing to disclose those facts<span class="Italic">. See Forma</span>, 57 MSPR at 103-05.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;As OPM rightly observes, it is not otherwise reasonable to assume that a wide variety of federal job applicants, responding to simple, general questions on employment forms in widespread use, should have a familiarity with the black-letter law of contracts in order to respond to them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on essentially the same facts, we reach the same result. The lack of a promise of unemployment benefits supporting the mutual agreement between the NYSP and the appellant that he should resign after allegations of unsatisfactory performance did not discharge him from his duty to tell the truth and to reveal the circumstances of his resignation. Our precedent simply does not direct us to absolve him from that responsibility, and we decline to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge also found that it was reasonable for the appellant not to disclose these matters in response to a question on the SF-86 asking whether he had left a job under "unfavorable circumstances" because that phrase was too broad and subject to wide interpretation. OPM argues that this finding is mistaken, and we agree. We do not dispute that the phrase is general and that, in a particular case, an employee might be justifiably uncertain about whether it applied to the specific facts of his employment history. This is not that case. As discussed above, the appellant left his job with the NYSP rather than face possible termination proceedings for unsatisfactory performance. Given those facts, the appellant reasonably should have known that he had left his NYSP job under unfavorable circumstances, and it was not reasonable for him to "exclude" a response on that issue. The argument that the phrase was too broad for him to respond accurately to the question thus is not plausible here, and an inference of an intent to deceive arises from his failure to submit a true response<span class="Italic">. See Hanker</span>, 73 MSPR at 164 (a failure to disclose information in response to a question on an SF-86, coupled with the lack of a plausible explanation for that failure, warranted an inference of an intent to deceive). For the reasons discussed above, then, the record shows that the appellant did give intentionally false or deceptive answers and engaged in dishonest conduct in completing the SF-86 and the SF-171.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forma v. DOJ</span>, 57 MSPR 97, 103 (1993) ("Because the appellant himself asserted that he left by mutual agreement, and he did not deny that there had been allegations of unsatisfactory performance, the only accurate answer to the question '[have you] left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance,' was 'yes.' Similarly, a 'yes' response was the only accurate answer to the question 'did you leave by mutual agreement because of specific problems,' because either allegations of poor performance or the existence of a 'mismatch' between the appellant's interests and strengths and the requirements of his position would have constituted a 'specific problem.'").</p>

Although Mr. White states that the Army's personnel agent advised him how to answer question 18a, which asked when he left his last federal job, there was substantial evidence whereby the Board could have found that Mr. White intended to withhold the information that he had been removed from his position with the VA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. White argues that the Army should have determined that he made an error and allowed him to correct it, or solicited more information, pointing out that the Army's administrator allowed him in to fill in other gaps in his form and correct other errors.

The Board concluded that the appellant truthfully responded when he gave the reason that caused his prior separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective May 30, 2008, the agency removed the appellant from his Federal Air Marshal (FAM) position with the Transportation Security Administration based on three specifications of lack of candor. Specifications 2 and 3 arose from the appellant's answering "no" to Question 22 on his Standard Form (SF) 86 and Question 20 on his Security Clearance Application concerning whether, in the previous 7 years, he had "[l]eft a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances." Specification 4 arose from the appellant's answer in response to a question during an administrative inquiry regarding why he resigned from his position with the United States Customs Service (USCS); he stated that he resigned in anticipation of his appointment to the agency and because of the USCS's refusal to reassign him to a different program. The deciding official determined that the appellant lacked candor because when the appellant resigned from his position with USCS on July 15, 2001, he was aware that USCS had proposed a 14-day suspension action on or about April 20, 2001.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After holding a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision that affirmed the removal action. He found that the agency proved the three specifications of lack of candor, and that the appellant failed to prove his affirmative defense. Further, the administrative judge found that the removal action promoted the efficiency of the service. In a timely filed petition for review, the appellant reiterates his arguments on appeal below. The agency did not respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sustaining the lack of candor charge, the administrative judge found that the proposed 14-day suspension action "was clearly relevant and should have been disclosed," even if the appellant's reason for leaving USCS was completely unrelated to the proposed suspension action. In so finding, he essentially concluded that the existence of the proposed disciplinary action ipso facto mandated its disclosure. However, such an approach bypasses the critical question of whether the appellant left USCS as a result of receiving the proposed 14-day suspension action, or if there were other circumstances that motivated his departure. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs v. Department of Justice</span>, 35 F.3d 1543, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (interpreting the "unfavorable circumstances" language as meaning that the circumstances caused an individual's departure from a job). The administrative judge should have weighed the conflicting evidence in this regard, but he made no findings on this issue. We therefore weigh the evidence on review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cummings v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 17, 21 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's July 27, 2001 resignation letter sets forth the alleged harassment to which he was subjected, articulates his frustration over USCS management's alleged reluctance or incapability to reassign him, and states that he was resigning "to stop [his] personal and professional turmoil since these 'managers' have made it a point to continue to perpetrate their harassment." He then states that "[i]t is sad commentary about how Customs really treats its employees. I am notifying your office that I am resigning from the [USCS] effective the date of this memorandum." This is consistent with the "reason for resignation" contained in the SF-50 documenting the appellant's resignation, which states, "incompetent management within polygraph operations investigation services division, and office of investigation, USCS," and with the appellant's oral and written statements to the agency and to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, relied heavily upon the portion of the SF-50 documenting the appellant's resignation, which states: "Agency Finding: resigned after receiving written notice on 04/20/01 of proposal to suspend for 14 days." The record evidence and the inherent inconsistencies in the SF-50 itself cast doubt upon whether the "Agency Finding" in SF-50 accurately described the motivation behind the appellant's resignation. In contrast, the "reason for resignation" section of the SF-50 is consistent with the reasons set forth in the appellant's July 2001 resignation letter and the other record evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that at the hearing and at his deposition, the appellant testified that following his resignation, USCS issued an SF-50 that did not include an "agency finding," and later issued a second one that included an "agency finding." This is consistent with the appellant's May 2008 written response to an agency official regarding his reasons for resigning from the USCS. The agency did not submit any evidence or argument on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2759"></span>It is also significant to our analysis that USCS's proposed disciplinary action had been pending against the appellant for approximately 3 months without apparent action when he decided to resign. There is no indication that USCS had decided to take or effect the action at the time of the appellant's resignation. Additionally, the proposed action was only a 14-day suspension, which further supports that it was not the motivation behind the appellant's resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lack of candor is a broader and more flexible concept than falsification, and as such, its contours and elements depend on the particular context and conduct involved. <span class="Italic">Little v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 18 (2009). It may involve a failure to disclose something that, under the circumstances, should have been disclosed to make a statement accurate and complete. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002). As discussed below, under the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the facts do not support a lack of candor charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither Question 22 in the SF-86 nor Question 20 in the Security Clearance Application specifically elicited whether the appellant left a previous job as a result of proposed or effected disciplinary actions. Regardless of what the agency and USCS believe was the reason for the appellant's resignation, the questions on these employment application forms are posed to the applicant for employment and, thus, the answers to these questions necessarily concern the applicant's reason for leaving a former job. Thus, the appellant was only obligated to inform the agency of the proposed disciplinary action in response to these questions if he left the USCS because of the proposed 14-day suspension action. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs</span>, 35 F.3d at 1547. As discussed above, there is little evidence to support the view that the appellant resigned from the USCS because of the proposed 14-day suspension, and much evidence supporting that the appellant resigned from the USCS for reasons unrelated to the proposed 14-day suspension. Consequently, he was not required to disclose the proposed disciplinary action in response to Question 22 on the SF-86 or Question 20 on the Security Clearance Application. We therefore find that the appellant did not demonstrate a lack of candor in responding to the questions at issue, and that the agency failed to prove Specifications 2 and 3. <span class="Italic">See Jacobs</span>, 35 F.3d at 1547.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final specification of lack of candor alleges that the appellant's responses during the December 2007 administrative inquiry regarding why he resigned from the USCS were "less then fully forthcoming" because the appellant first stated that he resigned from USCS in anticipation of his appointment to the agency, and then stated that he resigned following the denial of his transfer request. In support of this specification, the agency presented a memorandum summarizing the administrative inquiry prepared by an agency investigator on May 12, 2008. First, as noted above, the agency investigator drafted the memorandum on May 12, 2008, 5 months after the December 13 and 14, 2007 interviews. The record does not contain contemporaneous notes of the administrative inquiry, and the May 12, 2008 memorandum does not state that it was based on notes taken during the meeting with the appellant. Thus, there is reason to doubt the accuracy of the May 12, 2008 memorandum. Moreover, to the extent that the agency contends that the appellant failed to disclose the proposed disciplinary action, there is no indication that he was asked about such matters during the investigative interview. Finally, and most significantly, the appellant's purported responses during the administrative inquiry are consistent with the reasons he has repeatedly provided for his resignation from the USCS. Thus, we conclude that the agency failed to show that the appellant lacked candor during the December 2007 administrative inquiry.</p>

VA,</span> AT-0752-10-0045-I-1 (NP 5/13/2011) ("Regarding the charge of a lack of candor, the Federal Circuit has held that a lack of candor is a broad and flexible concept 'whose contours and elements depend upon the particular context and conduct involved.
