<p class="Body-Text">In cases affecting components of the civil service other than the Postal Service, the Federal Circuit applied law developed during the postal reorganization appeals and continued to distinguish reassignments or downgradings accepted by employees prior to the formal use of RIF procedures and those actions that followed invocation of RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Leibowitz v. MSPB</span>, No. 2007-3208 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), noted that a downgrade was voluntary if it was accepted as an alternative to a possible RIF but it was accepted prior to the agency both notifying the appellant that her position was abolished and stating that she would not be reassigned to a position at the same grade level:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Leibowitz was previously employed as a Territory Manager, GS-15, in Brooklyn, New York, for the Business/Self-Employed Division, Taxpayer Education and Communications ("TEC") organization of the Internal Revenue Service, Department of the Treasury ("the agency"). During a restructuring of TEC in 2003, the number of territories within the organization was reduced from seventy-six to forty-eight. Leibowitz's Territory Manager position was selected for elimination due to the consolidation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency informed Leibowitz on October 21, 2003, that her position was being eliminated and that she had until July 1, 2004, to find a new position. She was sixty-two years old at that time. Leibowitz filed an equal employment opportunity complaint alleging that age discrimination had been a factor in the elimination of her position, but she received an unfavorable determination on that claim on May 25, 2006. She also applied for two other GS-15 positions in her commuting area but was not selected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having been unable to find a position at the same level in the same area, Leibowitz signed a Change to Lower Grade Statement ("the CLGS") on February 16, 2004. Leibowitz later rejected the offer of a $25,000 Voluntary Separation Incentive Payout made by the agency on April 1, 2004. Leibowitz was then transferred to the position of Management and Program Analyst, GS-13, on May 16, 2004, but retained her GS-15 pay. The Notification of Personnel Action for the transfer states that the transfer was at her request. Also, her complaint statement indicates that Leibowitz took the lower grade with salary retention because she had been unable to locate a GS-15 position in her commuting area and feared that she would be terminated if she refused to accept the alternate position that would be assigned to her by the agency if she did not find a position on her own before July 1, 2004. She retired eight months after starting her new job because, as the Administrative Judge ("AJ") stated, she was disillusioned by the loss of her prior position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his Initial Decision on the agency's motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the AJ concluded that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear Leibowitz's appeal concerning alleged discrimination and her reduction in grade because the change in grade was voluntary and a discrimination claim could only be heard in connection with a claim over which the Board had jurisdiction. The AJ's ID became the final decision of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113. Leibowitz timely appealed to this court, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Leibowitz argues that the Board failed to address the evidence supporting her age discrimination claim and that this was error because the alleged discrimination caused her to take a position at a lower grade. She also argues that the agency failed to advise her regarding her rights if she did not sign the CLGS. In response, the government argues that the Board only has jurisdiction over a limited set of adverse actions affecting employees and that the Board correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over a reduction in grade undertaken voluntarily. The government did not respond to Leibowitz's allegation that she was not informed of her rights because she first raised that argument in her reply brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for the Board to decide an issue of discrimination, it must have been the basis of "an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the [Board]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. DHS</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). A reduction in grade may be appealed to the Board, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, but the adverse action must have been involuntary, <span class="Italic">see Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328. "Under our precedent, the Board does not have jurisdiction if an employee bids for a lower grade position, unless the agency induced the employee to bid for the lower grade job by informing [her] (1) that [her] position had been abolished and (2) that [she] would not be reassigned to a position at the same grade level." <span class="Italic">Marcino v. USPS</span>, 344 F.3d 1199, 1203 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Application for and acceptance of a lower grade position does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction so long as the application and acceptance are made after the agency informs the employee that she will not be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As this court has explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[coercive involuntariness] does not apply to a case in which an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave. As this court has explained, the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (quoting <span class="Italic">Staats v. USPS</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency had clearly informed Leibowitz that her position was being abolished, Leibowitz did not allege that the agency had informed her that she would not be reassigned. Instead, the record indicates that, faced with the possibility that she would be terminated if she refused a reassignment outside her current area of residence, Leibowitz voluntarily chose to accept a reduction in grade with salary retention for a position in her commuting area. A voluntary reduction in grade is not an adverse employment action that may be appealed to the Board, and the Board <span id="Page_3041"></span>could not therefore reach the underlying allegation of discrimination. The AJ also found that Leibowitz had made no allegation that she was misled by the agency, and she does not specify any such action or omission by the agency in her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board did not arbitrarily apply the jurisdictional requirements for an appeal of an adverse employee action, we <span class="Italic">affirm</span> its decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Knight v. DOD</span>, 332 F.3d 1362, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2003), determined that a reassignment/downgrading following announcement of a RIF was covered by the RIF regulations when the challenged personnel action was the result of a placement opportunity in lieu of separation that was negotiated between the agency and the employees' union as an arrangement to assist employees adversely affected by the RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government has not pointed to any precedent that contradicts our holding here. The government cites two RIF cases from this court, but they simply held that employees who voluntarily leave their positions in advance of an imminent RIF do not suffer an appealable adverse action. <span class="Italic">Krizman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 77 F.3d 434 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Mueller v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 76 F.3d 1198 (Fed. Cir. 1996). These cases are distinguishable because in both <span class="Italic">Krizman</span> and <span class="Italic">Mueller</span>, the employees decided to <span class="Italic">retire</span> before any appealable RIF action occurred. Neither <span class="Italic">Krizman</span> nor <span class="Italic">Mueller</span> involved an action where the agency chose to place an employee in a vacant position after the employee had been released or reached for release from his or her competitive level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government also cites several Board decisions, which of course are not binding on this court. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Owen v. Army</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 88 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. United States Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 640 (1997), cited by the government, were decided before this court decided <span class="Italic">Harants</span> and were overruled to the extent they were inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Harants</span>. The only pertinent Board decision cited by the government is <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 141, 145-46 (1999), which issued after <span class="Italic">Harants</span>. There, the Board held that it had no RIF jurisdiction where the employee voluntarily accepted a lower-grade position before the effective date of a RIF. In an apparent attempt to limit <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> stated that any Board precedent relied upon by <span class="Italic">Harants</span> "was never intended to give appeal rights to employees who receive valid RIF notices and who then voluntarily accept offers of other positions (that the agency was not obligated under the RIF rules to make) before their RIF placements are effectuated." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 144. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> reasoned that a RIF notice was a tentative proposal subject to modification or cancellation, and such proposed actions were not directly appealable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> further distinguished <span class="Italic">Harants</span> on the ground that <span class="Italic">Harants</span> and the Board decisions <span class="Italic">Harants</span> relied on, such as <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, all involved the Postal Service reorganization that was undertaken without affording the reorganized employees any RIF rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We decline to adopt <span class="Italic">Johnson's</span> reasoning. Statements made in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> cannot change the holding of <span class="Italic">Harants</span>. Nor do they compel a different holding in this case. Mere statement in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> of the prior intent of the Board does not change what <span class="Italic">Harants</span> stands for, because <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> does not discuss or refute the specific reasoning provided by <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, which was in turn adopted by <span class="Italic">Harants</span>. Although a tentative action is not appealable, in the present case, <span class="Italic">Knight</span> was already released from her previous GS-11 position and already demoted to the new GS-5 position when she appealed. <span class="Italic">Knight</span> is not appealing the RIF notice of October 1998, a tentative proposal; she is appealing an actual release, and a demotion that immediately followed. Although <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> is correct that <span class="Italic">Harants</span> involves the Postal Service reorganization, we do not find the analysis of <span class="Italic">Harants</span> limited to the Postal Service or to the 1992-1993 reorganization. Neither <span class="Italic">Harants</span> nor <span class="Italic">Brown</span> indicates that the reason for finding Board jurisdiction is because of the setting of the Postal Service or the reorganization undertaken without affording the reorganized employees any RIF rights. Instead, Brown held that the "timing of this offer [after the appellant was informed that he would not be retained in his former position], along with the agency's statements regarding the adverse consequences that might result from the appellant's failure to accept the offer...cause[d] it to be comparable to an offer of assignment under subpart G [&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.701-705] of the reduction-in-force regulations." <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 351. We thus find <span class="Italic">Johnson's</span> bare assertion not persuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board has jurisdiction over Knight's appeal under the RIF regulations. As the RIF regulation dictates: "This part does not require an agency to fill a vacant position. However, when an agency, at its discretion, chooses to fill a vacancy...this part shall be followed." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(b). Thus, although an agency is not obligated to fill a vacancy under RIF, when it nevertheless chooses to do so and when the other requirements of &#x00A7; 351.201(b) are satisfied, the action becomes part of the RIF. Our holding, however, does not cover any and every agency action relating to a RIF. Only, as is the case with Knight, where the agency chooses to fill a vacancy in a successor organization with an employee who has been reached for release from a competitive level for a legitimate RIF reason, such as reorganization, must the agency follow the RIF regulations. Consequently, the Board does have jurisdiction over the appeal under &#x00A7; 351.901.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A demotion accepted in anticipation of a reorganization and RIF, but before a notice from the agency that the employee would be released from his competitive level, did not constitute an appealable RIF. The Federal Circuit distinguished <span class="Italic">Harants</span> in <span class="Italic">Ovens v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3429):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Mr. Ovens' appeal challenges his demotion by the United States Department of the Army (Department) as part of a reduction-in-force (RIF) conducted in 1996. The Board dismissed the appeal because it found that Mr. Ovens' demotion was voluntary and therefore not appealable to the Board. Because Mr. Ovens voluntarily accepted a lower-graded position before he was informed of the action to be taken by the Department during the RIF, the Board is without jurisdiction to hear Mr. Ovens' appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. We therefore affirm the final decision of the Board dismissing Mr. Ovens' appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ovens was employed by the Department as a grade GM-14 Civilian Personnel Officer at the Civilian Personnel Office (CPO) in Fort Richardson, Alaska. The CPO in Fort Richardson was one of several CPOs located within the Pacific Region. In late 1995 and early 1996, the Department developed a plan to reorganize the Pacific Region to improve its cost effectiveness. The Department planned to consolidate many of the functions of the CPOs within the Pacific Region into a new Civilian Personnel Operations Center (CPOC) to be located at Fort Richardson, Alaska. Under the plan, only the director of the CPOC at Fort Richardson would be classified as a GM-14 position. The remaining positions were to be classified at the GS-13 level. As part of the reorganization, Mr. Ovens' position was to be abolished. On March 14, 1996, the Department notified Mr. Ovens that he did not have a transfer of function right to preferential consideration for the CPOC Director position. However, he was subsequently encouraged to submit an application and to compete for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 16, 1996, the Department offered Mr. Ovens a position as a Supervisory Personnel Staffing and Classification Specialist, Grade GS-13, in the newly created CPOC. The offer also included the right to saved pay for two years. The letter stated that this was the best offer that could be made to Mr. Ovens at that time and that he had five days from the receipt of the letter to accept the offer. If Mr. Ovens declined the position, or did not respond, the letter informed him that he would compete in a RIF for placement in the CPOC or into another organization in his competitive area. The letter finally stated that Mr. Ovens had the right to appeal his transfer to the Board and briefly explained the procedures for doing so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 30, 1996, Mr. Ovens accepted the GS-13 position within the CPOC offered to him in the May 16, 1996 letter. At that time, the selection process for the GM-14 Director position was not yet complete. Another candidate was eventually selected for the GM-14 Director position on June 18, 1996. Mr. Ovens was reassigned to the position of Supervisory Personnel Staffing and Classification Specialist, Grade GS-13 on September 29, 1996. He subsequently appealed his demotion to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated January 10, 1997, the Administrative Judge (AJ) found that Mr. Ovens had not been told that he would not be selected for a position at the same grade level and therefore his decision to accept the GS-13 position in the CPOC was a voluntary transfer. The AJ found Mr. Ovens' position legally indistinguishable from that in <span class="Italic">Cooley v. United States Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 353 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 80 F.3d 468 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The AJ therefore concluded that <span class="Italic">Cooley</span> governed Mr. Ovens' case and that the Board did not have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Ovens' appeal. The decision of the AJ became the final decision of the Board on July 11, 1997, pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Board is limited to agency actions for which the right to appeal is specifically granted by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a) (1994); <span class="Italic">Harants v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 130 F.3d 1466, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997). This court reviews the Board's jurisdictional conclusion <span class="Italic">de novo. See King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1217 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction in this case is governed by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901 which states: "An employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted by a reduction in force action may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board." An assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes an appealable RIF demotion even where the employee apparently accepts that position voluntarily, as long as the assignment is made after the agency has informed the employee that his original position had been abolished and that he had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. <span class="Italic">See Harants</span>, 130 F.3d at 1469. Mr. Ovens' only contact with the Department regarding his options during the forthcoming RIF was the May 16, 1996 letter informing him of the opportunity to accept a GS-13 position in the CPOC. Thus, this case turns entirely upon the characterization of the May 16, 1990 letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Ovens argues that the May 16, 1996 letter not only informed him that his position had been abolished as part of the RIF, but that it also informed him that he would not be retained at his current level. In support, Mr. Ovens points to paragraph four which begins: "The best offer which can be made to you at this time is a change to a lower <span id="Page_3042"></span>graded position." Contrary to Mr, Ovens' assertion, this language does not specifically inform him that he "had not been selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level." <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, 130 F.3d at 1469. A reasonable interpretation of this language is that it informs Mr. Ovens that, as of the date of the letter, a GS-13 was the best position available. It does not inform Mr. Ovens that, pursuant to the RIF procedures, he could not be retained in his current grade level as required by <span class="Italic">Harants</span> and <span class="Italic">Cooley</span>. <span class="Italic">See also Brown v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 351 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The GS-13 position in the CPOC which Mr. Ovens ultimately accepted was not offered to him as part of the RIF procedures. Rather, it was offered to Mr. Ovens only because he had previously volunteered for a position in the CPOC. In fact, the May 16, 1996 letter informed Mr. Ovens that "[i]f you decline this offer of a transfer of function, you will compete in a reduction in force at your installation for placement into the [CPOC]." The letter itself makes clear that a RIF competition had not yet taken place and consequently, Mr. Ovens could not have been informed that he was not selected for assignment to a position at his former grade level. In taking the GS-13 position in the CPOC, Mr. Ovens was not coerced into accepting the GS-13 position before the Department determined that he necessarily would be demoted. Because his decision to accept the GS-13 position in the CPOC was voluntary, the Board does not have jurisdiction to hear his RIF appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Owen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 74 MSPR 88, 90-92 (1997), decided that RIF jurisdiction was not established when the appellant took a voluntary downgrade that he applied for prior to receiving a specific RIF notice of separation and that he received by appointment a day after the RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding Board jurisdiction in this case, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 345 (1993), a case that grew out of the Postal Service's 1992 nationwide restructuring. There, the Board held that the appellant's "voluntary" acceptance of the agency's offer of assignment to a position with a lower rate of pay did not bar the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal under the RIF regulations, where he was offered the new assignment only after he was informed that he would not be retained in his former position. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 58 MSPR at 351-52. The Board found jurisdiction under the RIF regulations because the agency acted in total disregard of the appellant's RIF rights, and never advised him of any specific RIF placement position to which he was entitled. The Board reasoned that the appellant's assignment actually became an appealable RIF placement akin to a placement under Subpart G of the RIF regulations, Assignment Rights (Bump and Retreat)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, although the appellant was notified that he would be separated, no separation occurred because, prior to the effective date, he voluntarily requested and obtained assignment to a lower-graded position, rather than await the agency's action. Thus, the more proper precedent, we find, is <span class="Italic">Smitka v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 680, 685-86 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 95-3447, 1996 WL 84666 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 28, 1996) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Smitka</span>, the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellants' appeals of assignments outside their local commuting areas where, although notified that they were to be reassigned to a facility in another city, they were not permanently assigned to lower-graded positions in the other city, separated or furloughed before they requested and obtained reassignments to lower-graded positions in their local commuting area to avoid relocation. Prior to that time, the Board found, the agency was still considering its options and could have offered the appellants other positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, too, the agency could have canceled the appellant's planned separation before September 30, 1994, even if he had not applied, and been selected, for the position of GS-9 Guidance Counselor. Since the appellant was never separated, his decision to apply for the lower-graded position and accept the agency's offer is outside the Board's jurisdiction.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901 ("An employee who has been furloughed for more than 30 days, separated, or demoted <span class="Italic">by a reduction in force action</span> may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">Tomasello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 MSPR 640, 643 (1997). We further find that, because the appellant accepted the GS-9 position, in lieu of allowing the separation to be effected, the Board lacks jurisdiction to review his claim that he would not have been subject to separation if the agency had properly applied the TOF regulations to his former position. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 298, 4 MSPR 221, 223-24 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This result is not obviated by the fact that the agency afforded the appellant appeal rights to the Board in the specific RIF notice. Had he been subjected to the RIF action described in that notice, he would have been able to appeal to the Board under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901. We have found, however, that he was not. In any event, an agency's error in notifying an appellant of a right of Board appeal does not serve to confer jurisdiction on the Board. <span class="Italic">Miles-Townsend v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 405, 407 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The approach of <span class="Italic">Owen</span> was reaffirmed, and the Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">Harants</span> decision was distinguished, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 83 MSPR 141, 143-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12 (1999), concluding that a downgrading taken in advance of and apart from the rights specified in a RIF notice did not create a right of appeal to the Board when the appellant's alternative was to await the RIF and appeal the ensuing personnel action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[B]ecause the initial decision did not address the effect of <span class="Italic">Harants v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 130 F.3d 1466 (Fed. Cir. 1997) on this appeal, we do so here. The court in <span class="Italic">Harants</span> relied on Board precedent to hold that if the agency issues an employee a RIF notice informing him that his position will be abolished and that he has not been selected for another position at the same grade, the employee can appeal the RIF <span class="Italic">even if he voluntarily accepts another position prior to the effective date of the RIF notice. Id</span>. at 1469. The court gave no rationale for this holding other than noting that the Board had applied this principle previously. We hold here that any related Board precedent was never intended to give appeal rights to employees who receive valid RIF notices and who then voluntarily accept offers of other positions (that the agency was not obligated under the RIF rules to make) before their RIF placements are effectuated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A RIF notice is analogous to a proposed adverse action letter. Both are no more than notice to the employee that the agency has tentatively decided that some adverse personnel action is necessary. During the notice period in both situations, many things can happen that affect the final action of the agency. In the proposed adverse action situation, the employee may make a response to the charges that results in the agency reducing the proposed discipline level or deciding that discipline is not warranted at all. In the RIF notice situation, much happens within the organization relative to separations and position abolishment and reconstitution, and frequently the notice that informed the employee that his position had been selected for abolishment is canceled and the agency retains the employee in his old position or reassigns him to another position at his original grade. The agency may offer the employee a lower-graded position, and the employee may accept it, even though the agency was not obligated to do so under the RIF regulations. In both situations, the agency's notice to the employee is a tentative proposal subject to modification or cancellation up until the final effective date of the proposed action. The court and the Board have long held that proposed actions that are not effectuated or are canceled are not directly appealable. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 934 F.2d 1240, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Westmoreland v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 77 MSPR 315, 317 n.4 (1998); <span class="Italic">Shires v. Department of Defense,</span> 60 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee is issued a RIF notice, he has two choices: He can either wait until the effective date of the tentative action or he can voluntarily take another position or leave the agency altogether prior to the effective date of the action. In the former situation, he would obviously have Board appeal rights. In the second situation, however, it is unreasonable to give the employee appeal rights because he has voluntarily left his position prior to the effective date of the tentative action. Voluntary actions are not appealable to the Board, and "[t]he fact that an employee is faced with an inherently unpleasant situation...does not make an employee's decision any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Covington v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Once the employee has accepted a voluntary change to a lower-graded position, he should not be able to appeal an action that was never effected, the tentative RIF action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps most importantly, the principle at issue here can lead to a nonsensical result. For example, assume that the appellant has been given a RIF notice informing him that he is to be removed from his current position and placed into another position one grade lower in another part of the organization. The employee may well decide that he does not want to leave his current organization, and he accepts a voluntary demotion into a position in the same organization, but two grades lower than his current position. Under the principle applied in <span class="Italic">Harants</span>, what does the employee appeal: The two-grade demotion for which he volunteered or the one-grade demotion which was proposed? If it is the two-grade demotion, then why should the agency's liability be at that level rather than the one-grade demotion level it would have been if its proposed RIF action had been carried out? What if the agency's RIF notice identifies a potential one-grade demotion, but the employee resigns prior to the effective date; would <span class="Italic">Harants</span> require that we consider the resignation as a RIF separation?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case, in any event, is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Harants</span> and the Board precedent on which the <span class="Italic">Harants</span> decision relies, <span class="Italic">Hanson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 58 MSPR 413 (1993), and <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 58 MSPR 345 (1993). These three cases involved the Postal Service reorganization that was undertaken without affording the reorganized employees <span class="Italic">any</span> RIF rights. In that context, reassignments to lower-graded positions would be within our jurisdiction as involuntary placements because the Postal Service employees were completely divested of their RIF rights by the method in which the Postal Service undertook the reorganization. The employees' decisions to accept the demotions were tainted by the Postal Service's failure to extend RIF protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3043"></span>In the instant case, by contrast, the appellant was afforded his RIF rights and voluntarily chose to accept a reassignment to a lower-graded position. He did so knowing that if he did not accept the demotion, his placement rights would be protected by the RIF regulations and by his right to further appeal the action to the Board. In this context, the decision to accept a lower-graded position is voluntary and not within our jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ found, the proper result in this case is dictated by <span class="Italic">Owen v. Department of the Army</span>, 74 MSPR 88, 91-92 (1997), a non-Postal Service reorganization case in which the Board held that when an employee voluntarily accepts another position prior to the effective date of the RIF notice, the Board lacks jurisdiction over any subsequent RIF appeal. The reasoning in <span class="Italic">Owen</span>, that the agency could have canceled the planned RIF separation before the effective date of the RIF, and that there was no separation or demotion "by a reduction in force action" in accordance with 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.901, applies here as well.</p>
