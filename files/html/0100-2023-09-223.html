<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-220"><span class="space">2.</span> Disqualification of Representative; State Disciplinary Rules</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the analysis concerned an agency attorney, and the Board did not touch on state unauthorized practice statutes and rules, under <span class="Italic">Zapata v. USPS,</span> AT-0353-10-0712-I-1 (NP 7/10/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An attorney licensed in any state is authorized to practice as an attorney before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 429 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are few cases involving attempts to disqualify representatives. It was not until <span class="Italic">Collins v. DOJ</span>, 94 MSPR 62, 66-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-17 (2003), that the Board articulated an analytical standard for the application of disciplinary rules to lawyers challenged for conflicting interests. <span class="Italic">Collins</span> left much to be determined through future cases, but the essence of the decision was that state disciplinary rules would control, although a significant question remained of how to determine the applicable set of rules, e.g., the state where the hearing is held, the state where the retainer agreement was signed, the state where the employment dispute arose:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below that the appellant's representative, a licensed attorney in California, should be disqualified under California ethics rules. In denying the agency's motion, the administrative judge did not say whether she was applying state standards, standards ordinarily applied in federal court, or something else. Board caselaw can be read to suggest that analysis of a conflict of interest question does not depend on any established state or federal ethics standards, but is instead an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> inquiry. <span class="Italic">E.g., Levick v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 84, 90-91 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 155 F.3d 568 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">Davidson v. Department of Energy,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 531, 536 (1984); <span class="Italic">but see Sweeney v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 225 (1980) (applying, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> a federal criminal conflict-of-interest statute in determining whether an individual demoted from a managerial position to a position in the bargaining unit could be represented by a union on appeal), <span class="Italic">recon.</span> <span class="Italic">denied,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 646 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard that we apply to the agency's motion for disqualification will control how we rule on the motion. Under California ethics rules, where there is a "substantial relationship" between the current and former representation, an attorney will ordinarily be disqualified from the current representation<span class="Italic">. See</span> California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-310; <span class="Italic">Elan Transdermal Ltd. v. Cygnus Therapeutic Systems,</span> 809 F. Supp. 1383 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (applying state standards pursuant to local rules of district court); <span class="Italic">see generally Rosenfeld</span> <span class="Italic">Construction Co. v. Superior Court,</span> 235 Cal. App. 3d 566, 286 Cal. Rptr. 609, 612-15 (1991). Furthermore, under California ethics rules, someone who consults a lawyer about possible representation but does not actually retain him should nevertheless be treated as a "client" for conflict of interest purposes, if the lawyer received confidential information during the consultation. <span class="Italic">See</span> [Cal. Ethics Op. 1984-84 (California State Bar Committee on Professional Responsibility)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under California ethics rules, Matthews' representation of the appellant in this proceeding creates a conflict of interest. The appellant himself provides the "substantial relationship" between Saenz's consultation with Matthews and Matthews' current representation of the appellant. As stated above, in early 2001 the appellant put Saenz on a PIP. Saenz claimed that the appellant's action was discriminatory, she discussed the matter more than once with Matthews, and she asked him to represent her. In this case, Saenz is a witness who is expected to testify in support of the agency's charges that the appellant made unwelcome and inappropriate comments and gestures of a sexual nature in the workplace shortly before the PIP. Saenz credibly testified that she considered the subjects of her discussions with Matthews to be confidential. Indeed, by all appearances Matthews also considered the discussions to have been confidential, based on his circumspect questioning of Saenz at the hearing on the agency's motion, and based on his initial refusal, under principles of "privilege," even to acknowledge to the agency that Saenz had consulted him. Matthews' job in this proceeding is to discredit the agency's evidence against the appellant; the danger that confidential information he obtained from Saenz will give him an unfair advantage when he cross-examines her, or that he will inadvertently reveal a confidence, is too great to ignore. In this connection, it would be inappropriate for the Board to demand proof of exactly what Saenz said to Matthews when she consulted him, for doing so would require her to give up the very confidentiality that the California ethics rules are designed to preserve. <span class="Italic">Cf. Elan Transdermal Ltd.,</span> 809 F. Supp. at 1388 (a former client should not be forced to disclose confidential information in order to establish that a law firm's current representation of another party creates a conflict of interest).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The fact that Saenz is a witness and not a party in this proceeding makes no difference in the analysis under California ethics rules. <span class="Italic">American Airlines v. Sheppard, Mullin,</span> <span class="Italic">Richter &#x0026; Hampton,</span> 96 Cal. App. 4th 1017, 117 Cal. Rptr. 2d 685, 701 (2002). In addition, although Matthews' representation of the appellant could proceed if Saenz gave "informed written consent," California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-310(E), no such written consent has been given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result might be different if we were to analyze the conflict of interest question under "national" ethics standards developed by the American Bar Association (ABA). <span class="Italic">See Cole v. Ruidoso Municipal Schools,</span> 43 F.3d 1373, 1383 (10th Cir. 1994). Federal courts may apply an amalgam of ABA and state ethics rules. <span class="Italic">E.g., Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. U.S. Fire Insurance Co.,</span> 50 F.3d 1304, 1311-12 (5th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Cole,</span> 43 F.3d at 1383; <span class="Italic">Cromley v. Board</span> <span class="Italic">of Education of Lockport Township,</span> 17 F.3d 1059, 1066 (7th Cir. 1994). Under the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, a lawyer may be disqualified from a current representation when it is "substantially related" to an earlier representation or consultation, but only if the former client or consultee provided the lawyer with confidential information with a reasonable belief that the lawyer "was acting as the party's attorney." <span class="Italic">Cole,</span> 43 F.3d at 1384. Based on the totality of Saenz's testimony, it does not appear that she reasonably believed Matthews was "acting as [her]attorney."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before 1998, the question of whether to apply state or "national" ethics rules to attorneys appearing before the Board would have been difficult to resolve. This is because in 1989, the Justice Department issued a policy statement declaring that federal government attorneys appearing in federal court are exempt from some state ethics rules. <span class="Italic">See U.S. v. Lopez,</span> 989 F.2d 1032, 1035 (9th Cir. 1993) (discussing the government's <span id="Page_1204"></span>argument, based on the 1989 Justice Department policy statement, that an Assistant U.S. Attorney could not be held to the California state ethics rule governing communication with the opposing party). It would be undesirable for the Board to hold, in that vein, that although private attorneys representing appellants must follow state ethics rules, attorneys representing federal agencies need not do so. In 1998, however, the 1989 Justice Department policy was superseded by statute. Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-118. The statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An attorney for the Government shall be subject to State laws and rules, and local Federal court rules, governing attorneys in each state where such attorney engages in that attorney's duties, to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that State.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 530B(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute represents a policy determination by Congress that in litigation involving the federal government, the playing field should be level with regard to standards of attorney conduct. What would have been a difficult issue before 1998 has in essence been resolved for us by the enactment of 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 530B(a). Accordingly, we hold that an attorney appearing before the Board, whether representing a private party or an agency, will be expected to conform to applicable state rules governing attorney conduct. In this case, we apply California rules of attorney conduct because the hearing was set to take place in California.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In most cases, where a hearing is requested, the applicable ethics rules would be those of the state in which the hearing is to be held. Where a hearing is not requested, or where the hearing is by telephone or video conference with the participants in different states, the state with the closest relationship to the proceedings would provide the applicable rules of conduct. To resolve the conflict of interest question presented in this case we need not describe all of the possible situations that might arise where a choice of state ethics rules might be presented, and we leave it to administrative judges to make the necessary determinations in such future cases.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board may sanction the parties for violation of its rules and orders, influencing the outcome of their cases, <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 660, 666 (1995), and although the Board can eject unduly disruptive representatives from its proceedings, the Board generally does not act as an enforcer of state bar disciplinary rules that set minimum standards of professional conduct. <span class="Italic">Christofili v. Dept. of Army</span>, 81 MSPR 384, 392-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21 (1999), involving a discovery dispute, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the appellant's representative violated New Jersey's Rules of Professional Conduct, RPC 4.2 ("Communication With Person Represented By Counsel"). The agency further asserts that, just as the federal courts in the state of New Jersey have the authority to enforce the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct in proceedings before the federal courts, so does the Board in its proceedings. The administrative judge found that the Board lacks the authority to enforce the New Jersey Rules of Professional Conduct. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that the regulation of the practice of law and the discipline of members of a state bar is exclusively a state court matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Doyle v.

Specifically in this case, the Supreme Court of New Jersey has disciplinary jurisdiction over every attorney authorized to practice law in the state of New Jersey as set forth in the New Jersey constitution. <span class="Italic">See</span> N.J. Gen. Application R. 1:20-1(a). However, a "state code of professional responsibility does not by its own terms apply to sanctions in the federal courts." <span class="Italic">In re Snyder</span>, 472 U.S. 634, 645 n.6, 105 S. Ct. 2874, 86 L. Ed.2d 504 (1985).
