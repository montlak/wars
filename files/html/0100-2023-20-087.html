<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-89"><span class="space">b.</span> IRA Appeal, Direct Appeal of Otherwise Appealable Action Distinguished; Issue Preclusion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal of an adverse action or performance based action, an appellant's claim of whistleblowing reprisal is an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Ayers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 123 MSPR 11, 17 &#x00B6; 12, 2015 MSPB 58 (2015) (removal appeal). 2012 regulatory amendments from the Board make clear the election of remedies required by an individual who can, as to a given personnel action, initiate either an IRA appeal or a direct appeal to the Board in an otherwise appealable action. The IRA appeal sacrifices defenses and limits the scope of proof at the Board hearing on the IRA case. The direct appeal to the Board permits a broader range of defenses and a broader examination of the proof of the agency's charges. 5 CFR 1209.2 (2022) provides a regulatory explanation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Generally</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal to the Board from agency personnel actions alleged to have been threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appeals authorized</span>. The Board exercises jurisdiction over:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Individual right of action (IRA) appeals</span>. These are authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions listed in 1209.4(a) of this part that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 1</span>: An agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he reported that his supervisor embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. Because a performance evaluation is not an otherwise appealable action, Employee X must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board or before seeking a stay of the evaluation. If Employee X appeals the evaluation to the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminated or exhausted, his appeal is an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 2</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he previously filed a Board appeal of the agency's action suspending him without pay for 15 days. Whether the Board would have jurisdiction to review Employee X's performance rating as an IRA appeal depends on whether his previous Board appeal involved a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing. If it did, the Board could review the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the employee has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). If the previous appeal did not involve a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Similarly, if Employee X believed that the current performance appraisal was retaliation for his previous protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) activity, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 3</span>: As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as "minimally satisfactory." Employee X believes that the agency has rated him "minimally satisfactory" because he testified on behalf of a co-worker in an EEO proceeding. The Board would have jurisdiction over the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the appellant has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 4</span>: Citing alleged misconduct, an agency proposes Employee Y's removal. While that removal action is pending, Employee Y files a complaint with OSC alleging that the proposed removal was initiated in retaliation for her having disclosed that an agency official embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. Employee Y may file an IRA appeal with respect to the proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Otherwise appealable action appeals</span>. These are appeals to the Board under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) that include an allegation that the action was based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. Otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a). An individual who has been subjected to an otherwise appealable action must make an election of remedies as described in 5 U.S.C. 7121(g) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example 5</span>: Same as Example 4 above. While the OSC complaint with respect to the proposed removal is pending, the agency effects the removal action. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. With respect to the effected removal, Employee Y can elect to appeal that action directly to the Board or to proceed with a complaint to OSC. If she chooses the latter option, she may file an IRA appeal when OSC has terminated its investigation, but the only issue that will be adjudicated in that appeal is whether she proves that her protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action and, if so, whether the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Employee Y in the absence of the protected disclosure. If she instead files a direct appeal, the agency must prove its misconduct charges, nexus, and the reasonableness of the penalty, and Employee Y can raise any affirmative defenses she might have.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Issues before the Board in IRA appeals</span>. In an individual right of action appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. The appellant may not raise affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty, as a requirement under 5 U.S.C. 7513(a), i.e., that its action is taken "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." However, the Board may consider the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its adverse action in determining whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(3), an employee who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel action in retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity "may elect not more than one" of 3 remedies: An appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701; a negotiated grievance under 5 U.S.C. 7121(d); or corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with the Special Counsel (5 U.S.C. 1214), which can be followed by an IRA appeal filed with the Board (5 U.S.C. 1221). Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(4), an election is deemed to have been made based on which of the 3 actions the individual files first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3794"></span>(2)&#x2003;In the case of an otherwise appealable action as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee who files a complaint with OSC prior to filing an appeal with the Board has elected corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, i.e., a complaint filed with OSC, which can be followed by an IRA appeal with the Board. As described in paragraph (c) of this section, the IRA appeal in such a case is limited to resolving the claim(s) of reprisal for whistleblowing or other protected activity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board lacks jurisdiction over a matter directly appealed to the Board, there is no election of remedies precluding the appellant from initiating an IRA case with OSC and then, upon exhaustion of the OSC remedy, pursuing the matter through a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dydell v.

<p class="Body-Text">Before regulatory changes in 2012 and 2013, the appellant made no substantial sacrifice in defenses or proof by starting out with OSC in an IRA case. Before 2012, an appellant with an appealable adverse action could first file a corrective action request with the Office of Special Counsel, alleging whistleblowing reprisal, wait out the OSC process, and then initiate an appeal from the underlying adverse action and the whistleblowing reprisal complaint with the Board. The Board in turn adjudicated both the adverse action, as if it had originally been filed directly with the Board, and the whistleblowing claim, as in <span class="Italic">Samble v. DOD</span>, 98 MSPR 502, 507 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employees subject to adverse actions that are within the Board's jurisdiction, who also allege that the action constituted reprisal for whistleblowing, may choose either to seek corrective action from the OSC before appealing to the Board or to appeal directly to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(b)(2). Here, the appellant chose the former and his Board appeal is timely if filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC's issuance of its notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation into his whistleblowing allegations. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1209.5(a)(1), 1209.5(b); <span class="Italic">Massimino v.

[<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l) (the date of filing by mail is the postmark date). Thus, the appeal was filed within 65 days of the date of the OSC's letter terminating its investigation and was timely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board has jurisdiction and the appellant timely filed his appeal, the appellant has a right to the same appellate procedures that he would have been given in an adverse action appeal notwithstanding his choice to seek corrective action from the OSC before filing his appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">Massimino</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 324-25. Thus, the appellant has the right to, among other things, the hearing that he requested. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in <span class="Italic">Samble</span> was <span class="Italic">Massimino v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 318, 323-25 (1993), stating that if an otherwise appealable action is first pursued through the OSC on a claim of whistleblowing reprisal, the subsequent appeal to the Board, assuming it was timely filed after the OSC closeout letter, will encompass not only the whistleblowing claim but the underlying merits of the otherwise appealable action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the scope of the Board's review in most appeals includes both the merits of the action appealed and any affirmative defenses asserted, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c), it extends only to the whistleblower issue in IRA appeals. In this appeal, because the demotion and reassignment action at issue constitutes an OAA, the administrative judge determined that the appellant may receive an adjudication of all of his claims raised in his appeal. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 636 n.3 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), we did not decide the Board's scope of review applicable to a matter that may properly be brought as an IRA appeal that is also directly appealable to the Board because that case was not an OAA appeal. We must decide the issue in this OAA appeal, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1222 states that "[e]xcept as provided in section 1221(i), nothing in...chapter[12] or chapter 23 shall be construed to limit any right or remedy available under a provision of statute that is outside of [either chapter]." Thus, section 1222 strongly suggests that any rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, such as the right to raise affirmative defenses in matters appealable under those chapters, are not restricted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This interpretation of section 1222 is supported by the legislative history of the WPA. In their joint explanatory statement regarding the WPA, House and Senate Members made the following explicit statement regarding the "availability of other remedies":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [WPA] contains a new section 1222 of title 5, United States Code, which provides that the network of rights and remedies created under chapter 12 and chapter 23 of title 5 is not meant to limit any right or remedy which might be available under any other statute....Section 1222 is not intended to create a cause of action where none now exists or to reverse any court decision. Rather, section 1222 says it is not the intent of Congress that the procedures under these chapters of title 5, United States Code, are meant to be exclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. H750 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in enacting the WPA, Congress was attempting to expand and enhance the protections and appeal rights afforded to whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See Gergick v. General Services Administration,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 659-60. To limit an employee's appeal rights and remedies <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> an OAA, which is directly appealable to the Board by definition, when the employee first chooses to seek corrective action from the OSC, would be contrary to the letter and the purpose of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1222; <span class="Italic">Gergick</span> [<span class="Italic">supra</span>].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Board's jurisdiction and scope of review in this appeal is the same as if the appellant had filed a petition for appeal of the demotion reassignment action with the Board in the first instance rather than first filing a complaint with the OSC.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The approach of <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> was questioned in footnote 2 to the nonprecedential final order in <span class="Italic">McDowell v. Dept. of Army,</span> SF-0752-11-0536-I-1 n.2 (NP 4/27/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant first made an election, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g), to seek a remedy for his removal by pursuing corrective action with OSC under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1), and the administrative judge adjudicated this appeal as an otherwise appealable action following chapter 75 procedures. <span class="Italic">See Massimino v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 318, 322-23 (1993) (Board determined that chapter 75 procedures should be followed for Individual Right of Action (IRA) appeals where the case involves a personnel action included in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512). However, we are not convinced that this precedent properly interprets 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g). <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). It is well established that an employee is deemed to have made a binding election of forum when he has timely filed either a notice of appeal under the Board's applicable appellate procedures, a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, or an allegation to OSC under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Calvetti v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Thus, having elected to first file a complaint with OSC under section 7121(g), an appellant's appeal probably should be processed in accordance with the rules and procedures for an individual right of action (IRA) appeal. In such cases, the only issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e), i.e., whether the appellant has demonstrated that one or more whistleblowing disclosures was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the protected disclosure(s). Nevertheless, we need not resolve this issue here because it would not affect the outcome in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The questions raised in <span class="Italic">McDowell</span> were resolved through the 2012 regulatory amendments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not resolved through the 2012 regulatory amendments was the importance of notice by an agency to an employee to bind the employee's election between IRA and adverse action appeals jurisdiction. The issue was the subject of discussion in <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/AGORANOS_PETER_J_CH_1221_11_0466_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_829963.pdf">119 MSPR 498</a>, 506-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18, 2013 MSPB 41 (2013) (earlier noted in the discussion on grievance elections), determining that the agency must make the appellant aware of the election of remedies for a choice to bind the appellant in an action otherwise properly before the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the undisputed record evidence shows that, before filing an appeal with the Board, the appellant filed a complaint with OSC alleging that the agency denied him a WIGI, and that he amended his complaint to allege that he was removed in reprisal for his whistleblowing. However, the agency removed the appellant without notifying him of his right to file a request for corrective action with OSC under subchapters II and III of chapter 12 of title 5 and without notifying him of the effect that such an election would have on his appeal rights before the Board. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's filing of the OSC complaint did not constitute <span id="Page_3795"></span>a valid, informed election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. Therefore, he was not precluded from filing a subsequent appeal of his removal, and he was not restricted to the issues within the scope of an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends on review that the appellant made a "strategic choice" before the administrative judge to forgo his rights under chapter 43 and to limit his appeal to one seeking corrective action for whistleblower retaliation. However, the record does not show that the appellant received any notice that the consolidation of his appeals would result in the waiver or loss of any his claims for relief from his removal appeal. At the time the appellant requested dismissal of his removal appeal, Board precedent stated that when an individual who was affected by an action that is directly appealable to the Board chooses to file a whistleblower retaliation complaint with OSC, the jurisdictional basis of any later appeal to the Board is the authority under which the agency took the personnel action, not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221. <span class="Italic">Massimino v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 318, 323 (1993). This precedent further held that the scope of such an appeal is not limited to whistleblower retaliation as an IRA is, but instead includes all issues that could have been adjudicated had the individual appealed directly to the Board (e.g., the merits of the personnel action, which the agency bears the burden of proving; denial of due process; discrimination; harmful procedural error; other prohibited personnel practices). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c). In 1994, over one year after the Board decided <span class="Italic">Massimino</span>, Congress enacted amendments to the WPA that added 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g). Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(b), 108 Stat. 4365. <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> was thus abrogated by statute, but the Board erroneously continued to follow <span class="Italic">Massimino</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Calvetti v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 4 n.1 (2007). Accordingly, even though the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) negates the holding in <span class="Italic">Massimino</span>, the appellant and his counsel could have reasonably relied upon the <span class="Italic">Massimino</span> holding in concluding that the appellant was not waiving any of his affirmative defenses when he requested to withdraw his removal appeal. Under similar circumstances, the Board has found that an appellant who has exercised due diligence should be permitted to reopen a withdrawn removal appeal and to proceed with the adjudication of his appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 423, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Shannon v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9 (2005) (Board reopened an appeal where the appellant withdrew the appeal based on representations of the administrative judge that he could pursue his claim of reprisal for whistleblowing with OSC). We therefore reopen the appellant's chapter 43 removal appeal and remand it to the Chicago Regional Office for adjudication on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the notice of a required election between an IRA appeal and a direct Board appeal is not properly provided by the agency, it may be provided by the AJ, but the information from the agency must be sufficient to allow an informed election, <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DE-0752-15-0483-B-1 (NP 9/15/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who claims to have suffered whistleblowing reprisal regarding an action may elect no more than one of the following remedies: a direct appeal to the Board; a negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121; or a request for corrective action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapters II and III, i.e., an OSC complaint, potentially to be followed by an IRA appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 17 (2015), <span class="Italic">clarified by Gardner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 30-31 (2016). Ordinarily, an individual who first requests corrective action from OSC will be deemed to have made a binding election to proceed in that forum. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4)(C); <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 17. In such a case, the jurisdictional requirements for an IRA appeal apply, even if the contested personnel action would have been directly appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 17. However, the Board also has held that an election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) is binding only if made knowingly and voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not make a knowing election because the agency failed to provide her with notice of the consequences of her election. As a result, he provided the appellant with the opportunity to elect either an IRA appeal challenging her removal based on alleged whistleblower reprisal or an adverse action appeal challenging her removal under chapter 75 and raising affirmative defenses. As to a potential IRA appeal, he found that the appellant exhausted her administrative remedies with OSC; that is, that OSC had investigated her allegations, found no basis for determining that a violation of her rights under the whistleblower laws occurred, and provided her with Board appeal rights. As to a potential removal appeal under chapter 75, he found that the appellant timely filed the appeal and that the Board had jurisdiction over it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge found that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal under chapter 75, the choice that he presented to the appellant was essentially a choice between adjudicating--or withdrawing--her affirmative defenses other than whistleblower reprisal. When an appellant raises affirmative defenses, the administrative judge must apprise her of the applicable burdens of proving those defenses and must address those defenses in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. <span class="Italic">Erkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 8 (2008). When an appellant makes an election to pursue an appeal as an IRA appeal, as opposed to an otherwise appealable action, based on the mistaken belief that he could still pursue his nonwhistleblowing affirmative defenses in an IRA appeal, the Board has found that the election was not knowing and informed and, therefore, not binding. <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 18 (2013) (finding that the appellant's election to pursue his claims as an IRA appeal was not a valid, informed election when the record did not show that he received notice that his election would result in the waiver or loss of any of his claims for relief from his removal appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge did not explicitly advise the appellant that she would be withdrawing her affirmative defenses if she chose to pursue her appeal as an IRA appeal, or give her an opportunity to object. Moreover, the appellant's continued assertions throughout the appeal pertaining to her affirmative defenses other than whistleblower reprisal evidence a misunderstanding that, by choosing to pursue her appeal as an IRA appeal, the Board would no longer consider those claims. <span class="Italic">See Zendejas v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 348, &#x00B6; 6 (2007) (explaining that a withdrawal based on a misunderstanding constitutes an exception to the general finality rule). Therefore, we find that, although the appellant circled the option for pursuing her appeal as an IRA appeal, the record evidence indicates that she wanted the merits of her removal and all of her affirmative defenses adjudicated by the Board and that she misunderstood that she was waiving these claims. Under these circumstances, we find a remand is necessary to adjudicate the merits of her removal and any affirmative defenses she raised in response to the removal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Freeborn v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 18 (2013) (instructing an administrative judge on remand to adjudicate a previously withdrawn whistleblower reprisal claim if the administrative judge determined that the appellant made a binding election to proceed with that claim before the Board and that his decision to withdraw that claim was based on a material misunderstanding that he could pursue the claim at a later date).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory election scheme does not preclude an appellant whose direct appeal from an otherwise appealable action (e.g., a coerced resignation) to the Board is dismissed as untimely from initiating an IRA complaint with OSC and then filing an appeal with the Board if whistleblowing is properly alleged, as in <span class="Italic">Brundin v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 75 MSPR 332, 334-36 (1997), a decision that also noted the significance of timely filing in the election scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 14, 1996, the appellant filed a petition for appeal (MSPB Docket No. NY-0752-96-0194-I-1) from an allegedly involuntary resignation; she asserted, among other things, that she had resigned involuntarily due to agency reprisal for her whistleblowing activities. In a June 3, 1996 initial decision, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed, and the Board denied the appellant's petition for review of the initial decision on August 30, 1996.... On April 24, 1996, the appellant sought corrective action from the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) regarding her allegedly involuntary resignation. After the lapse of more than 120 days without action by OSC on her complaint, the appellant filed the instant individual right of action (IRA) appeal, contending again that she had resigned involuntarily due to agency reprisal for her whistleblowing activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After issuing a show-cause Order on the issue and affording the appellant an opportunity to respond, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He found that the appellant's prior appeal of her resignation foreclosed her from filing a later IRA appeal of that matter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary resignation is tantamount to a removal; a removal may be appealed to the Board and is characterized by regulation as an "otherwise appealable action." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(2), 1209.2(b)(2); <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 2 MSPB 307, 2 MSPR 140, 141 (1980). The administrative judge thus correctly found that the appellant had alleged that she had been affected by an otherwise appealable action when she asserted that her resignation was involuntary. An appellant affected by an otherwise appealable action who asserts that the action was based on his whistleblowing activities may choose either to seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA appeal with the Board or to appeal directly to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1209.2(b)(2); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 USC 1214(a)(3), 1221(a), (b). The administrative judge interpreted 5 CFR 1209.2(b)(2) to mean that the appellant here could choose one of the two options for raising her allegations that her resignation was involuntary due to whistleblower reprisal, but that she could not choose both. He concluded that the appellant had already chosen one of those options by appealing her resignation directly to the Board and that she could not later file an IRA appeal of that matter; he dismissed the appeal on that basis....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our own examination of the remedial structure created by Congress for resolving allegations of whistleblower reprisal, we conclude that the 1994 act to reauthorize OSC, in which Congress amended 5 USC 7121 by adding subsection (g), governs the remedies available to an aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice <span id="Page_3796"></span>other than the one cited in 5 USC 7121(d). <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 4361, 4365-66. (In addition to the prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2302(b)(1) described in 5 USC 7121(d), 5 USC 2302 sets forth ten other prohibited personnel practices, among which is reprisal against whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(8).) The new provision stated that such an employee could "elect" not more than one of the following remedies: An appeal to the Board under 5 USC 7701; a negotiated grievance procedure under 5 USC 7121; or procedures for seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III[*] of chapter 12 of title 5<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Those subchapters set forth procedures allowing an employee to seek corrective action from OSC before filing an IRA appeal with the Board regarding allegations of whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1211-1222.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we note that the appellant was covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the American Federation of Government Employees and that the agreement provided for a negotiated grievance procedure for the resolution of employee complaints "concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee." The agreement specifically excluded complaints concerning certain actions from the negotiated grievance procedure, but complaints alleging involuntary resignation or constructive removal (as the appellant has alleged here) were not among those excluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an employee covered by a negotiated grievance procedure who raised allegations of whistleblower reprisal, then, the appellant could elect one and only one of the three remedies set forth in 5 USC 7121(g); if she elected the Board remedy by filing a prior appeal of her resignation, she could not later file an IRA appeal of the same matter. The statute, however, also specifically provides what an employee must do to "elect" any of the listed remedies. In the case of a Board appeal, an employee has not elected that remedy unless he has "timely filed a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(g)(4)(A). As discussed above, the Board dismissed the appellant's prior appeal because it was not timely filed; she therefore did not "elect" the Board remedy by filing that appeal. The agency has conceded that the appellant has not challenged her resignation by using the negotiated grievance procedure. The appellant thus has not elected two of the three cited remedies in 5 USC 7121(g) and could properly elect the remaining remedy, corrective action procedures under subchapters II and III of chapter 12 of title 5, to raise allegations of whistleblower reprisal in connection with her resignation. The remedial structure created by Congress therefore did not preclude the filing of the instant IRA appeal of the appellant's resignation, and dismissal of the appeal thus was not appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some decisions before the 2012 regulatory amendments were unclear as to the effect of an IRA election on an otherwise appealable action.<span class="Italic"> Shannon v. DHS</span>, 100 MSPR 629, 636-37 &#x00B6; 17 (2005), raised but did not decide the question of whether an election of remedies bars an IRA appeal based upon an action first appealed as an adverse action beyond the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n the event that the AJ determines on remand that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the termination appeal under chapter 75, and because there is no jurisdiction to hear the appellant's claim of reprisal for whistleblowing if his appeal is considered under part 315, subpart H, it is necessary to determine whether the appellant's IRA appeal would be viable. The Board has not squarely addressed the question of whether an appellant makes a valid election under section 7121(g), precluding a later IRA appeal, when he files an earlier direct appeal over which the Board lacks jurisdiction. That section provides that an election of a direct appeal with the Board is deemed made when the appellant "has timely filed a notice of appeal under the <span class="Italic">applicable</span> appellate procedures." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(4)(A) (emphasis added). If the AJ finds that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the termination appeal, then the termination appeal cannot constitute an exercise of the "applicable" appellate procedures. Because jurisdiction never attached, the original appeal was not a true choice among viable alternatives and, thus, cannot serve as an election of remedies under section 7121(g). Therefore, under those circumstances, the termination appeal would not constitute a binding election of remedies so as to preclude the appellant's subsequent IRA appeal. In that event, the AJ must adjudicate the appellant's IRA appeal, including threshold issues of IRA jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant who files simultaneously with the Board and OSC could have elected a Board appellate rather than IRA remedy--a result of complex analysis of an alleged constructively adverse action coupled with whistleblowing reprisal allegations, <span class="Italic">Hinton-Morgan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 75 MSPR 382, 397-99 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 4361, limited the choice of remedies of Federal employees covered by labor management agreements who allege that they have been subject to prohibited personnel practices other then those listed in 5 USC 2302(b)(1), which prohibits discrimination on the bases of race, color, religion, sex (including equal pay violations), national origin, age, handicap, marital status, and political affiliation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2302(b)(1)-(b)(11); 7121(d), 7121(g). An employee covered by a labor management agreement alleging that she was subjected to a personnel action that is not excluded from the application of the agreement's grievance procedures, and who alleges that the personnel action was taken in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(2)-(11), must elect one of three remedies. She must elect: (A) An appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 USC 7701; (B) a negotiated grievance procedure; or (C) procedures for seeking corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel under 5 USC 1214 and 1221. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(g). A person shall be considered to have elected remedy (A) if she has filed a timely notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedure, remedy (B) if she has timely filed a grievance in writing, and remedy (C) if she has sought corrective action from the OSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(g)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant herein is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and she is alleging that she was subject to a prohibited personnel practice other than those listed in &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), retaliation for whistleblowing under 5 USC 2302(b)(8). Further, under the terms of the labor management agreement, constructive demotion is not excluded from the application of the agreement's grievance procedures. Thus, the appellant's allegation that the agency's constructive demotion was reprisal for whistleblowing was subject to the election provisions of 5 USC 7121(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not file a grievance, however, she filed a constructive demotion appeal and an allegation of retaliation for whistleblowing with the Board. She also filed a request for corrective action regarding the same matter with the OSC. She did not, however, file with the OSC before she filed with the Board. Specifically, the appellant filed her constructive demotion appeal in Seattle on January 16, 1996, even though the constructive demotion was not effected until January 21, 1996. On January 29, 1996, she amended that appeal to allege that the demotion was the result of improper conduct by her supervisor. On that same date, she also filed a request for corrective action regarding the same constructive demotion with the OSC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the appellant's constructive demotion appeal ripened after she filed her Board appeal, <span class="Italic">see Campbell v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 147, 151 (1996), but before January 29, 1996, the date on which she amended her appeal to allege that the constructive demotion was taken in retaliation for her whistleblowing, and on which she filed her request for corrective action with the OSC. She therefore did not file her request for corrective action before she filed the same matter with the Board. Further, because the appellant's constructive demotion appeal ripened after she filed with the Board, the record establishes that it was timely filed regardless of the ultimate finding on the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.22(b). Accordingly, when she filed her constructive demotion appeal and her allegation that this action was retaliation for whistleblowing with the Board, she elected one of the remedies provided in &#x00A7; 7121(g), and foreclosed the others, including the remedy of corrective action from the OSC and the Board under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214 and 1221.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case appears to be complicated by the fact that the Board has not yet made a determination whether it has jurisdiction over the merits of the appellant's constructive demotion appeal. We have, therefore, considered whether a finding, that the appellant's filing of a constructive demotion appeal with the Board under 5 USC 7701 was an election of remedies under 5 USC 7121(g), could harm the appellant's substantive right to a remedy on her whistleblower allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, in the appeal filed under &#x00A7; 7701, the Board finds that the appellant was subjected to a Chapter 75 appealable action, an involuntary demotion, it has jurisdiction over the merits of her appeal, and it will adjudicate her whistleblower allegations. If, however, the Board finds that the appellant was not subjected to a Chapter 75 appealable action because her demotion was voluntary and that therefore it lacks jurisdiction over her appeal, it will not decide the appellant's whistleblower allegations. Further, the principle of collateral estoppel would bar the appellant from establishing jurisdiction over her IRA appeal under 5 USC 1221 because the underlying personnel action, the constructive demotion, is identical to the action at issue in the 7701 appeal. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 332, 336-37 (1995); <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's substantive right to a remedy on her whistleblower allegations, therefore, hinges on whether she proves on remand in a full evidentiary hearing that she was subjected to an involuntary demotion. Accordingly, we decline to take jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal, which involves issues alike in all material respects to those in the adverse action appeal, and dismiss the IRA appeal under 5 USC 7121(g). <span class="Italic">See Brundin v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 75 MSPR 332 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant who first files with the Board, withdraws his appeal, and then attempts to take his case to OSC and then again to the Board may find the latter case precluded by the former, <span class="Italic">Hartman v. MSPB</span>, 131 Fed. Appx. 729, 730-31 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3797"></span>In June 2000, the Department of Veterans Affairs removed the petitioner...for inability to perform his duties and unauthorized absence. Hartman appealed the action to the Board, but after he was granted disability retirement, he voluntarily withdrew his appeal, which the Board dismissed in August 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He then filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel ("Office"). In 2003 the Office informed him that it was closing its file. It pointed out that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(2) an aggrieved employee could elect "not more than one" of the following remedies: "(1) to exercise his right to pursue this matter under his agency's negotiated grievance procedure, if any; (2) to file a timely appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board; or (3) to submit a complaint to the Office of Special Counsel." It stated that "[t]he fact that you had an appeal pending before the Board is evidence of your election of remedies; thus, establishing our lack of jurisdiction." It also stated that he could file a request for corrective action with the Board. Letter from Office to Hartman (Feb. 19, 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hartman filed such a request. In his initial decision, which became final when the Board denied review, the Board's administrative judge dismissed the request for corrective action. The administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The record shows the appellant withdrew his first MSPB appeal, which challenged the removal action that forms the basis for the instant request for corrective action. Withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes the underlying action from the MSPB's jurisdiction, and the appeal will not be reinstated in the absence of unusual circumstances, such as where the decision to withdraw was based on misleading or incorrect information...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he record does not indicate the sort of unusual circumstances that would justify reinstating the appellant's prior MSPB appeal. Consequently, his request for corrective action must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although OSC's February 13, 2003 letter invited the appellant to file a request for corrective action with the MSPB, an erroneous notice of appeal rights does not create a right of appeal where one would not otherwise exist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 3-4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Office noted, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g)(2), Hartman was required to elect only one of three remedies. By filing a timely appeal with the Board, Hartman made his election and he was precluded from later seeking relief from the Office. <span class="Italic">See Thurman v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 598, 600-01 (1998); <span class="Italic">Collins v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 582, 587-88 (2001). Hartman's voluntary dismissal of his appeal to the Board did not vitiate his earlier election to invoke that remedy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's settled practice apparently is that an appellant's voluntary withdrawal of an appeal to it precludes the Board from reinstating the appeal unless there are unusual circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Drummond v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 231, 233 (2002); <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 159, 161 (2001); <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 168, 171 (1991). As the administrative judge correctly stated, the fact that the Office told Hartman that he could seek corrective action from the Board does not create a right of appeal where one would not otherwise exist. <span class="Italic">See Mosher v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 355, 357 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have no reason to reject the administrative judge's conclusion that Hartman had not shown "the sort of unusual circumstances that would justify reinstating the appellant's prior MSPB appeal."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may occur that a personnel action, e.g., a reassignment or detail that is alleged as whistleblowing reprisal, could be taken to the Board through the IRA process while the agency takes an action, e.g., removal, that is directly appealed. Since the removal is not part of the IRA case, it cannot be directly addressed as a consequence of the action reviewed in the IRA case. The relief, if any, is through presentation of whistleblower reprisal as an affirmative defense in the direct appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-1221-12-0654-C-1 n.5 (NP 2/24/2015) ("Although the appellant argues that the removal of his supervisory duties was instrumental in the charges that resulted in his removal, as noted above, his removal is simply not at issue here, only the taking away of his supervisory duties. Such an argument would instead be addressed appropriately as an affirmative defense in the appellant's pending removal appeal."). The appellant must ensure that the OSC complaint is not amended in some manner to include the removal before the removal is appealed to the Board; confusion of the scope of the OSC complaint may lead to an unintended election of remedies that creates an IRA case as to the removal rather than allowing a direct appeal of the removal.
