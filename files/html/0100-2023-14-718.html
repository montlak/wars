<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-719"><span class="space">a.</span> Reopener, Zipper Clauses</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although the Fourth Circuit took issue with FLRA's belief that midterm bargaining obligations arise as a matter of law upon the request of the union, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1280, 1288 (4th Cir. 1992) [discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-016.html#sec8-17">Midterm Bargaining Obligation and the 'Covered By' Doctrine: <span class="Italic">SSA</span></a>"], FLRA resolutely maintains that parties can bargain over midterm reopeners. FLRA required this in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1995 and Dept. of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Ctr.</span>, 47 FLRA 470, 471, 472-73 (1993), approving as negotiable the proposal that "[t]he parties contractually agree that at the [midterm] of this agreement, either party may request to reopen the contract to renegotiate a maximum of two articles contained within this agreement":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute, a proposal will be found nonnegotiable if, among other things, it is inconsistent with Federal law.... However, the Agency cites no specific provision of law with which the proposal is allegedly inconsistent....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we construe the Agency's argument that the proposal is incompatible "with the most basic statutory objective of protecting the 'paramount right of the public to as effective and efficient a Government as possible'" as a contention that the proposal is inconsistent with section 7101 of the Statute, we reject that contention. The Agency has not demonstrated, and we find no basis in the record on which to conclude, that the limited reopener clause provided by the proposal would lead to an unstable collective bargaining relationship between the parties so as to be inconsistent with the statement in section 7101 of the Statute that the provisions of the Statute "should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Agency's reliance on the court's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the court found that an agency did not have an obligation to bargain midterm over union-initiated proposals in the absence of management action changing unit employees' conditions of employment.[2] In contrast, the issue presented by the proposal in this case is whether the Agency is prohibited by law from entering into the proposed reopener clause or whether the proposal is otherwise nonnegotiable. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> that demonstrates that the Agency is prohibited by law from entering into the reopener clause proposed by the Union or that the proposal is otherwise nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;As acknowledged by the Agency, the Authority has respectfully <span id="page_1144"></span>declined to follow the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 45 FLRA 1290, 1291 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note the Agency's assertion that the proposal would lead to a "great increase in the costs of bargaining and the attendant dispute resolution processes." We find that the Agency's assertion is speculative and does not provide a basis for finding the proposal nonnegotiable. Moreover, when considering cost arguments in contexts other than management's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, we have held that an agency is not exempt from the obligation to bargain over a union proposal solely because that proposal may result in an increase in costs....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 62 FLRA 267, 283-84 (2007) (petition for review granted in part, denied in part, and remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 550 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (addressing proposals involving grooming standards)), approved negotiability of Proposal 9, that "[e]ither party may reopen this MOU at any time subject to the mutual requirements to negotiate prior to implementation to the extent required by law and regulation":</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to &#x00A7; 2427.2 of the Authority's Regulations, the Office of Personnel Management (the Petitioner) requests that the Authority issue a general statement of policy or guidance regarding whether "zipper clauses"--provisions that would foreclose or limit midterm bargaining during the term of a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA)--are a mandatory subject of bargaining. Specifically, the Petitioner asks us to find that zipper clauses are a mandatory subject of bargaining. We find that they are.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the basis for its request, the Petitioner asserts that the Authority's precedent regarding zipper and reopener clauses has created an anomaly because only reopener clauses can be bargained to impasse.[4] According to the Petitioner, the Authority's failure to address whether parties must bargain over a zipper clause creates a "fundamental inequity" for parties seeking to adopt a zipper clause. Because the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel) may resolve negotiation impasses over only mandatory subjects of bargaining, the Petitioner argues that the Authority's lack of clarity about zipper clauses precludes the Panel from considering proposals that <span class="Italic">limit</span> midterm bargaining, but not reopener proposals that <span class="Italic">broaden</span> midterm bargaining.[6] Therefore, the Petitioner urges that the Authority should enable parties to bargain zipper clauses to impasse by finding that such clauses are mandatory subjects.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Mandatory subjects of bargaining are topics within the required scope of bargaining.[10] As mentioned earlier, any party may bargain to impasse over mandatory topics.[11] Decades ago, the Authority and the U.S. Courts of Appeals engaged in a years-long legal tug-of-war about whether the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) required midterm bargaining,[12] and whether the Statute made proposals about midterm bargaining mandatory subjects that parties may negotiate to impasse.[13] At different times, the Authority provided different answers to those questions.[14] Further, the U.S. Courts of Appeals disagreed with one another about what the Statute required.[15] Consequently, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;For the sake of simplicity, from this point forward, the shorthand phrase "midterm bargaining" refers to bargaining over union-drafted, negotiable proposals during the term of a CBA, where: (1) the proposals are not in response to an agency-initiated change to conditions of employment; (2) the proposals are not covered by an existing agreement; and (3) the union has not waived any right that it may have to bargain over those proposals.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">On remand from the Court, the Authority looked once again at whether the Statute required midterm bargaining and whether the parties must negotiate over proposals concerning their midterm-bargaining obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, the Authority held that the Statute required midterm bargaining,[18] for several reasons. The Authority observed that nothing in the Statute distinguished between obligations for midterm and term bargaining.[19] In addition, matters appropriate for collective bargaining are "sometimes unforeseen and unforeseeable," and the Authority concluded that such matters should be addressed through midterm negotiations, rather than "the more adversarial grievance/arbitration process."[20] Further, the Authority determined that the "mutual" obligation to bargain in good faith called for equalizing the positions of the parties by requiring both sides to negotiate over midterm changes that the other initiated.[21] Moreover, the Authority determined that midterm bargaining would likely lead to more efficient negotiations by allowing parties to address concerns in a timely manner, and by relieving the need to bargain over every conceivable topic during term negotiations, even when many of those topics might prove insignificant during the CBA's term.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Next, the Authority addressed whether the Statute made reopener clauses mandatory subjects for negotiations. The Authority held that it did,[23] for two reasons. First, the Authority held that a reopener clause would merely restate a statutory obligation, and proposals restating statutory obligations were within an agency's obligation to bargain.[24] Second, the Authority held that a proposal about midterm bargaining was not inconsistent with law or government-wide rule or regulation.[25] However, the Authority declined to address whether zipper clauses were mandatory subjects for negotiation, which eventually led to the request in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find that by resolving the Petitioner's question concerning zipper clauses--a question that has persisted for decades without a clear answer--we will provide guidance with "general applicability" under the Statute[26] on a matter that currently confronts parties in the context of a labor-management relationship.[27] Therefore, we grant the Petitioner's request for a general statement.[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;To the extent that this conclusion is inconsistent with the Authority's statement, twenty years ago, that the parties' obligations to bargain over zipper clauses would be "more appropriate[ly resolved] where the matters are squarely presented," <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 56 FLRA at 54, we find that the passage of an additional two decades without any clear guidance on zipper clauses militates in favor of issuing a general statement now.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B. <span class="Italic">Empowering the Parties to Answer a Question that the Statute Does Not</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously mentioned, the Supreme Court held that the Statute does not clearly require or prohibit midterm bargaining.[29] In its decision on remand from the Supreme Court, the Authority decided that the Statute requires midterm bargaining.[30] However, the Authority's first consideration to support that conclusion is flawed. In particular, the Authority found that the Statute does not distinguish between obligations for midterm and term bargaining.[31] But in one important respect, those obligations are distinguishable: The parties' mutual obligation to bargain in term negotiations is clearly established in the Statute,[32] whereas a mutual obligation to bargain midterm is not.[33] Indeed, that indeterminacy in the Statute's text was the driving force behind the Supreme Court's ruling.[34] Although the Court recognized that the Authority could resolve that ambiguity, and the Authority did so, we find it more appropriate to recognize that the Statute neither requires nor prohibits midterm bargaining. Instead, the Statute leaves midterm-bargaining obligations to the parties to resolve as part of their term negotiations.[35]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;The dissent argues that "this finding is nothing new." Dissent at 11. And we have not maintained otherwise. But the suggestion that we cannot reexamine our precedent without a "new" judicial finding to spur our reevaluation sits uncomfortably alongside cases in which previous majorities--of which the dissenting Member was a part--overturned Authority precedent without any judicial prompting. <span class="Italic">E.g., NTEU, Chapter 302,</span> 65 FLRA 746 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting) (overruling Authority precedent without intervening judicial precedent); <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 65 FLRA 509 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting, in part) (same); <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA,</span> 65 FLRA 113 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (same); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F.

<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;Indeed, in the long history of litigation over these issues, there has been universal agreement that the obligation to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective[-]bargaining agreement" compels bargaining over negotiable proposals for a term CBA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4).</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[35]&#x2003;We note that the Authority previously denied a different request from the Petitioner for a general statement of policy or guidance about whether the Statute requires midterm bargaining, and that denial was based, in part, on the fact that the "guidance sought by [the Petitioner was] sufficiently provided by existing Authority precedent." <span class="Italic">U.S. OPM</span>, 71 FLRA 423, 423 (2019) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 64 FLRA 156; <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 56 FLRA 45). However, the previous request did not concern zipper clauses, and the precedent on which the Authority based its previous denial did not resolve whether zipper clauses were within the duty to bargain. In the request at issue here, the question of the parties' obligations to negotiate zipper clauses has been squarely raised. And because those obligations depend, in some respects, on whether the Statute itself compels midterm bargaining, we find it necessary to address the Statute's midterm-bargaining requirements in order to properly evaluate whether zipper clauses are mandatory subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 399 F.3d 334, 340-43 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (reviewing, with approval, Authority precedent holding that a proposal that requires a party to waive a unilateral right must be a permissive, not mandatory, subject of bargaining).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we now hold that proposals that concern midterm-bargaining obligations--whether they resemble reopener or zipper clauses, or take some other form--are mandatory subjects of bargaining under the Statute.[36] </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;The dissent cannot decide whether it disagrees with our decision for being too broad, Dissent at 11 (criticizing, in the dissent's words, "the purported need to respond to a request for a policy statement that did not even <span class="Italic">present</span> this question"), or too narrow, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 14 n.39 (criticizing the failure to "attempt to explain how the parties should proceed with respect to midterm bargaining if their term agreement contains neither a zipper nor a reopener clause").

<p class="noindent-1">That treatment is consistent with the Authority's previous recognition that matters relating to the parties' midterm-bargaining relationship plainly relate to conditions of employment.[37] Further, the Statute presumes that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining unless the text explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party an unqualified, or "unilateral," right.[38] As explained above, the Statute does not, on its own, explicitly or by unambiguous implication vest either party with a unilateral right to engage in midterm bargaining.[39] In other words, because neither party would be required to waive a statutory right, any proposal concerning midterm bargaining would come within the default rule that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;Notwithstanding the dissent's gratuitous hyperbole, Dissent at 14, one need only read that "any proposal concerning midterm bargaining would come within the default rule that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining" to grasp the implications for negotiability, impasse, and unfair-labor-practice cases involving midterm-bargaining proposals. While this general statement cannot offer answers for every question that may arise regarding parties' future midterm-bargaining obligations, the absence of absolute certainty inheres in <span id="page_1146"></span>most statutory interpretations, including those that the Authority set forth in Interior. 56 FLRA at 54, 56-57 (majority refused to clarify whether zipper clauses were mandatory subjects of bargaining, despite dissent's insistence that the analysis ignored an essential area of concern).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4) of the Statute provides further support--beyond the default rule--for treating proposals concerning midterm bargaining as mandatory subjects for negotiation.[41] Specifically, that section says that the parties "may determine appropriate techniques, consistent with the provisions" of &#x00A7; 7119--concerning negotiation impasses--"to assist in any negotiation."[42] For example, adding a reopener clause to a CBA may allow the parties to expedite bargaining by presently avoiding topics of little immediate concern that "could unnecessarily and inefficiently broaden and prolong term negotiations."[43] On the other hand, adding a zipper clause to a CBA may provide management with an assurance that its other contractual commitments will not be interpreted as imposing an ongoing midterm-bargaining obligation.[44] In other words, management negotiators can have greater confidence that, if they agree to union-favored proposals that recognize additional midterm bargaining obligations for the agency, then those obligations can be counterbalanced with an appropriately tailored zipper clause.[45] Thus, the parties may adopt proposals concerning midterm bargaining as "appropriate techniques. . .to assist in any negotiation,"[46] which is an additional reason for finding them to be mandatory subjects of bargaining.[47]</p>

Second, even among those without an applicable reopener clause, the dissent's concern would extend only to parties that do not already protect employees' health and safety in their agreements. Third, because many parties already include health and safety provisions in their agreements, even in the absence of our decision today, the covered-by doctrine would arguably preclude further bargaining by those parties on employee health and safety initiatives, unless the parties mutually agreed to reopen their existing agreements or already included a reopener clause that applied in this situation.

<p class="noindent">The 2020 General Policy Statement was vacated by <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220128086">24 F.4th 666</a>, 668-77 (D.C. Cir. 2022), determining that bargaining over zipper clauses, i.e., restrictions on mid-term bargaining, is permissive:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When issues arise during the term of a collective bargaining agreement that are not covered by the agreement, federal employees may seek to bargain with their agency employers over how such issues should be handled. For its part, an agency may try to head off such midterm bargaining by securing during term bargaining a clause in the parties' collective bargaining agreement that limits or forecloses midterm bargaining. Such a clause is commonly referred to as a zipper clause--a clause that treats the term agreement as having zipped up, or closed off, potential midterm bargaining. Unions, valuing the opportunity to negotiate midterm on unforeseen matters not already covered by the existing agreement, such as the effect of a pandemic on the workplace, generally oppose zipper clauses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not disputed that parties may negotiate over and agree to a zipper clause. But what happens if an agency proposes a zipper clause, and the union disagrees on whether or to what extent to include it in the collective bargaining agreement? The answer largely depends on whether zipper clauses are a "mandatory" or "permissive" subject of bargaining. Federal labor law treats some subjects of collective bargaining as mandatory, meaning that when parties bargain to impasse over proposals on those subjects, a dissatisfied party may seek resolution from the Federal Service Impasses Panel. And Panel resolution may include imposition of the clause in the agreement over the other party's objection. In contrast, subjects that are permissive for one or both parties are those on which a party may choose to, but need not, bargain. A party may decline to negotiate on proposals on permissive subjects, and its counterparty may not take disputes over such proposals to the impasses panel for potential insertion into the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unions here challenge a Policy Statement of the Federal Labor Relations Authority that announced for the first time that zipper clauses are mandatory bargaining subjects. <span class="Italic">U.S. Off. of Pers. Mgmt. (Petitioner) (Policy Statement),</span> 71 F.L.R.A. 977, 977 (Sept. 30, 2020). In other words, the Authority determined that, if an agency and a union intractably disagree over a zipper clause proposal, the agency may bring the proposal to the impasses panel--which has the authority to put it (or a different clause reflecting what it determines to be a better resolution) into the parties' term agreement. FLRA policy statements are unusual: Before producing a spate of them in 2020, including the one challenged here, the Authority had not issued any Policy Statement in over thirty-five years. Three labor unions challenge this one as arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We grant the petitions for review and vacate the Policy Statement. Importantly for our analysis, the Authority chose to structure its consideration of the zipper clause question in two steps, casting its answer at step one as also determinative of step two. The Authority first held that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) does not entitle employees to demand midterm bargaining even when the parties' agreement is silent on the matter. <span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. The Authority then relied on that holding as "necessary" to its conclusion that proposed contractual zipper clauses expressly foreclosing midterm bargaining are mandatory bargaining subjects. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 979 n.35. The first holding was arbitrary and capricious. The Authority's errors include miscasting Supreme Court precedent, relying on conclusory assertions, and mischaracterizing its dramatic shift of the bargaining baseline as allowing "the parties to resolve" the issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 979. And, because the Authority avowedly rested its second holding on its first, we must vacate the zipper clause holding as well. In view of these conclusions, we need not rule on the unions' threshold objection that the Authority ignored its own criteria for issuance of general statements of policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2427.5. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have had few occasions to address the distinction between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining. In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA (AFGE 1983), 712 F.2d 640 (D.C. Cir. 1983)</span>, we held that matters relating to conditions of employment are presumptively mandatory bargaining subjects unless the Statute "explicitly or by unambiguous implication" provides a party with a "unilateral right[ ]" regarding the matter under consideration. AFGE 1983, 712 F.2d at 646 &#x0026; n.27 (formatting modified). If the Statute clearly confers a right on a party, in other words, the party may refuse to bargain over proposals on that matter. Agencies, for instance, need not bargain over their right "to determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). And employees need not bargain over their right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment." <span id="page_1147"></span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102. But a party must bargain in good faith over any lawful proposal that does not trench on its unilateral rights. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reaffirmed and elaborated that standard in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA (NTEU 2005),</span> 399 F.3d 334 (D.C. Cir. 2005). We explained that not all rights provided by the Statute are necessarily unilateral rights and so permissive subjects of bargaining: Only rights which the Statute "explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party" rise to the level of unilateral rights over which a party may but need not negotiate. <span class="Italic">NTEU 2005,</span> 399 F.3d at 340 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE 1983,</span> 712 F.2d at 646 n.27).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As OPM recognized in its request for the Policy Statement, whether zipper clauses are mandatory or permissive bargaining subjects was an open question. No court had squarely decided whether unions have a unilateral right to bargain midterm, nor had the Authority. The Authority expressly declined to decide the point in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C. (Interior),</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 45 (2000), on remand from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court had held in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees,</span> Local 1309 v. Interior (<span class="Italic">Local 1309</span>), 526 U.S. 86 (1999), that the Statute's text is ambiguous as to whether it confers a general right to midterm as well as term bargaining. Local 1309, 526 U.S. at 92. The key provision simply requires that parties "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 88 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4)). As the Court noted, "[o]ne can easily read 'arriving at a collective bargaining agreement' as including an agreement reached at the conclusion of midterm bargaining" just as it includes one resulting from term bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 93 (second emphasis added). The Court acknowledged agencies' concerns that midterm bargaining could incentivize piecemeal negotiation, but also recognized policy reasons that the Statute might require midterm bargaining: "Without midterm bargaining," the Court wondered, "will it prove possible to find a collective solution to a workplace problem, say, a health or safety hazard, that first appeared midterm?" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 94. Indeed, the Court reasoned, "[t]he Statute's emphasis upon collective bargaining as 'contribut[ing] to the effective conduct of public business' suggests that it would favor joint, not unilateral, solutions to such midterm problems." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (second alteration in original) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(B)). The Court accordingly remanded for the Authority, informed by its "expertise in its field of labor relations," to decide whether the Statute requires midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 99 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA,</span> 464 U.S. 89, 97 (1983)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority took up that question in <span class="Italic">Interior</span> and held that "under the Statute, agencies are obligated to bargain during the term of a collective bargaining agreement on negotiable union proposals concerning matters that are not 'contained in or covered by' the term agreement, unless the union has waived its right." <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. at 54. Quoting Congress's statutory findings supportive of public-sector collective bargaining, the Authority underscored that nothing in the Statute suggests those findings are any less applicable to midterm than term bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)). The Authority's own judgment, informed by its experience, was that midterm bargaining leads to "more focused negotiations," neither prompting kitchen-sink term bargaining over issues that might never arise, nor delaying resolution of important concerns that arise midterm until term negotiations recommence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 52. The Authority rejected as "unsupported and speculative" arguments that union-initiated midterm bargaining was harmful to federal sector labor relations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 54. In its experience, midterm bargaining was appropriately limited by the doctrine barring renegotiation of matters covered by the term agreement, gave rise to few disputed cases, and had not led to piecemeal or "continuous" bargaining as critics feared. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 53.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But <span class="Italic">Interior</span> decided only the default rule that parties have a "statutory right" to bargain midterm if the contract is otherwise silent. The Authority disclaimed any view on whether proposals for contractual zipper clauses are mandatory or permissive bargaining subjects. <span class="Italic">See Interior,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. at 54 ("[W]e will not consider" here the question "whether 'zipper clauses' are a mandatory subject of negotiation."). In deciding that the Statute requires midterm bargaining, then, <span class="Italic">Interior</span> left open whether it does so "by unambiguous implication" so confers a "unilateral right" of the sort <span class="Italic">AFGE 1983</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU 2005</span> described. That state of affairs prevailed for two decades. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority in November 2019 rejected a request to revisit <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> describing the case as its "seminal" precedent recognizing the statutory right to midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">See OPM,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. 423, 423 (2019). But just ten months later, in the Policy Statement before us, the Authority reversed course. Before addressing the question expressly left open by <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Authority circled back to repudiate the core holding of <span class="Italic">Interior</span> that it had reaffirmed just months earlier. Deeming reconsideration of that issue "necessary" to its decision of the question OPM presented--whether zipper clauses are mandatory or permissive--the Authority revisited <span class="Italic">Interior's</span> holding that the Statute requires midterm bargaining at all, even as a default rule. <span class="Italic">See Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979 n.35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a paragraph, the Authority jettisoned <span class="Italic">Interior</span>. Contrary to its reasoning in <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Authority's Policy Statement deemed it "more appropriate" to conclude that the Statute does not require midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">See Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. The Authority declared that the Statute "clearly established" an obligation to bargain at term, but it saw "indeterminacy in the Statute's text" as to whether it requires midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The entirety of its analysis of the distinction it drew is terse:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As previously mentioned, the Supreme Court [in <span class="Italic">Local 1309</span>] held that the Statute does not clearly require or prohibit midterm bargaining. In its decision on remand from the Supreme Court, the Authority decided that the Statute requires midterm bargaining. However, the Authority's first consideration to support that conclusion is flawed. In particular, the Authority found that the Statute does not distinguish between obligations for midterm and term bargaining. But in one important respect, those obligations are had the Authority. The Authority expressly declined to decide distinguishable: The parties' mutual obligation to bargain in term negotiations is clearly established in the Statute, whereas a mutual obligation to bargain midterm is not. Indeed, that indeterminacy in the Statute's text was the driving force behind the Supreme Court's ruling. Although the Court recognized that the Authority could resolve that ambiguity, and the Authority did so, we find it more appropriate to recognize that the Statute neither requires nor prohibits midterm bargaining. Instead, the Statute leaves midterm-bargaining obligations to the parties to resolve as part of their term negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnotes omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having erased <span class="Italic">Interior</span> by holding that the Statute simply does not obligate agencies to bargain midterm, the Authority then addressed the question OPM had posed: whether zipper clauses are mandatory or permissive bargaining subjects. Basing its conclusion on its reversal of <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Authority held that zipper clauses are mandatory bargaining subjects. Immediately after the above-quoted paragraph regarding <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Authority dispatched the zipper clause issue as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Thus, we now hold that proposals that concern midterm-bargaining obligations--whether they resemble reopener or zipper clauses, or take some other form--are mandatory subjects of bargaining under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">That treatment is consistent with the Authority's previous recognition that matters relating to the parties' midterm-bargaining relationship plainly relate to conditions of employment. Further, the Statute presumes that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining unless the text explicitly or by unambiguous implication vests in a party an unqualified, or "unilateral," right. As explained above, the Statute does not, on its own, explicitly or by unambiguous implication vest either party with a unilateral right to engage in midterm bargaining. In other words, because neither party would be required to waive a statutory right, any proposal concerning midterm bargaining would come within the default rule that all matters relating to conditions of employment are mandatory subjects of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979-80 (footnotes omitted)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The core of the Authority's reasoning is that, "[a]s explained above" in the prior paragraph regarding <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Statute does not require midterm bargaining at all, even as a default matter, so necessarily fails to establish any unilateral right to midterm bargaining that would make it permissive, not mandatory, for unions to negotiate whether to retain that right to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 980. The Authority held that the Statute consequently treats zipper clauses as mandatory bargaining subjects that, upon impasse, may be imposed on unions against their will by action of the impasses panel. In a footnote, the Authority added that it was "necessary" to decide whether the Statute requires midterm bargaining "in order to properly evaluate" the zipper clause question. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 979 n.35. The Authority also asserted that other statutory language, which allows parties to determine appropriate techniques to aid their negotiations, offered "further support" for its position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 980.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Three federal employee labor unions timely petitioned for review, and we consolidated those cases. The unions contend that the Authority violated its regulations providing criteria for issuance of Policy Statements, abrogated its precedent without reasoned explanation and in contravention of the Statute's text and purpose, and relied on unreasoned bases for concluding that zipper clauses are mandatory subjects of bargaining. We have jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a), and the unions have standing, <span class="Italic">see AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 750 F.2d 143, 144-45 (D.C. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">. . .</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority's First Holding Was Arbitrary and Capricious.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority failed to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision that the Statute does not require midterm bargaining. The Policy Statement <span id="page_1148"></span>simply deemed it "more appropriate" to read the Statute to not require midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. But it offered no non-arbitrary reason why.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The only explanation the Authority offered was what it saw as a negative implication of the statutory text: The Statute "clearly established" term bargaining but was "indetermina[te]" as to midterm bargaining, it reasoned, implying the exclusion of the latter. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But the statutory text does not separately define term and midterm bargaining. The text the Authority leans on as showing the "one important respect" in which the Statute differentiates the two bargaining stages, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> in fact makes no distinction at all. It says only that the parties must "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement"--whether in term or midterm negotiations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). </p>
<p class="noindent-1">Indeed, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Local 1309</span> held that the very phrase on which the Authority here relies does not differentiate the two bargaining stages, so that text cannot alone impart the meaning the Policy Statement ascribes to it. The Court stressed that the operative provision simply refers to collective bargaining, and that "[o]ne can easily read 'arriving at <span class="Italic">a collective bargaining agreement'</span> as including an agreement reached at the conclusion of midterm bargaining." 526 U.S. at 93 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4)); <span class="Italic">see also Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 983 (Member DuBester, dissenting) (observing that "<span class="Italic">Local 1309</span> rejected this very premise" that the Policy Statement relies on). In fact, as discussed above, the Court suggested that the Statute's text, structure, history, and objectives taken together might imply a duty to bargain midterm as well as at term, <span class="Italic">see</span> 526 U.S. at 94--perhaps even by unambiguous implication, <span class="Italic">see Interior,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. at 54 (leaving the point open). As manifest by the Court's remand, the textual ambiguity of the identified phrase does not itself mean that midterm bargaining is <span class="Italic">not</span> required. </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's contrary view cannot stand. Its parsing of the same few words that the Court considered in <span class="Italic">Local 1309</span> was the only reason the Authority gave for the first analytic step of its Policy Statement. In the absence of any other support, that first conclusion is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That flaw alone requires vacatur. But the Authority's holding was unreasoned in three further ways.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">First,</span> the Authority rested its policy decision on a basic mischaracterization of the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">Local 1309</span> that wrongly equated not expressly requiring midterm bargaining with prohibiting it. The <span class="Italic">Policy Statement</span> declares that "the Supreme Court held that the Statute does not clearly require or prohibit midterm bargaining." Policy Statement, 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. But the Supreme Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's view that the Statute prohibits midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">See Local</span> 1309, 526 U.S. at 91-92. The only question on remand to the Authority following the Court's Local 1309 decision was whether the Statute recognizes a right to midterm bargaining or instead simply does not address it. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 88. In miscasting <span class="Italic">Local 1309</span> as leaving open whether the Statute "requires [ ]or prohibits" midterm bargaining, 71 F.L.R.A. at 979, the Authority incorrectly suggested its decision struck a middle position on the issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Second,</span> the Authority based its holding on an unsupported premise that its Policy Statement increased choice among the parties. It reasoned that "the Statute leaves midterm-bargaining obligations to the parties to resolve." <span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. But reversing <span class="Italic">Interior</span> affected the default rule, which applies if the parties have not otherwise decided whether and how they will bargain midterm. The Authority did not explain how altering that default to empower the impasses panel to intervene and forbid or limit midterm bargaining increases party choice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Third,</span> even as it acted without advance notice or justification to abrogate its decades-old precedent in <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> the Authority in the same breath described itself as taking no position on the issue <span class="Italic">Interior</span> resolved. The Policy Statement commented that, following Local 1309, the Authority "could resolve" the textual ambiguity and "did so" in Interior, but that it now deemed it "more appropriate" to leave that question "to the parties." 71 F.L.R.A. at 979. But it did nothing of the sort. In fact, as discussed above, it flipped the baseline that the Authority, pursuant to the Supreme Court's remand, had set in <span class="Italic">Interior</span> to hold instead that the Statute does not require midterm bargaining. Under the guise of neutrally declining to exercise the policy authority it wielded, the Authority answered the precise question that it simultaneously said it "could" but did not resolve. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also gave no hint in its public notice that it viewed the zipper clause question as opening the door to reconsidering its longstanding holding in <span class="Italic">Interior.</span> It thus issued its Policy Statement without the benefit of public comment on <span class="Italic">Interior's</span> continued vitality. <span class="Italic">See Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 984 &#x0026; n.34 (Member DuBester, dissenting) (describing how commenters assumed <span class="Italic">Interior's</span> "well-established principle" was not up for reconsideration). But because we hold that the Authority's reasoning was deficient, we need not reach whether the rule might be procedurally defective on that ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The drive-by procedure and conclusory reasoning that produced the challenged Policy Statement is little match for the full process and detailed analysis that supported the Authority's determination in Interior. There, the Authority had deployed subject matter expertise to analyze the Statute and assess how best to structure the bargaining relationship. Here, the Authority did nothing of the sort. It dispensed with <span class="Italic">Interior</span> in one paragraph of flawed textual analysis, devoid of any reasoned application of its labor relations expertise. Because the Policy Statement does not pass muster under <span class="Italic">State Farm,</span> we need not reach the unions' contention that the Authority's change from its previously established position imposed any distinct burden of justification, particularly whether the Authority implicitly contravened factual findings from <span class="Italic">Interior</span> or unsettled strong reliance interests, <span class="Italic">see FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.,</span> 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 (2009). </p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's holding on the first step by which it structured its decision thus fails as unreasoned, so we vacate it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority's Second Holding, Which It Expressly Rested on the First, Was Also Arbitrary and Capricious.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority next held that zipper clauses are mandatory bargaining subjects. Because the Authority rested this holding critically on the first, we must vacate it as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority expressly framed its second, zipper-clause holding as dependent on and flowing from its reconsideration of Interior. The Authority found it "necessary" to reach its first holding in order to "properly evaluate" the zipper clause question. <span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 979 n.35. Then, after stating what counts as a unilateral right, the Authority made its second holding by cross reference: "As explained above," it wrote, zipper clauses must be mandatory bargaining subjects. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 980. The Authority offered no other, independent rationale for its zipper clause holding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's own decisional architecture, then, its second conclusion rests on its first. Bound as we are by the Authority's actual justification, <span class="Italic">see Chenery II,</span> 332 U.S. at 196, we hold that the collapse of the first step brings the second down with it. <span class="Italic">See also Am. Petroleum Inst.,</span> 862 F.3d at 71; <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 108 F.3d at 1459.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a rationale offered as "further support" for its zipper clause holding--not as an alternative basis that could bear the holding's full weight absent the Authority's first holding--the Authority pointed to section 7114(a)(4). Nothing about that provision helps to distinguish mandatory bargaining subjects from permissive ones. The Statute there says that parties "may determine appropriate techniques. . .to assist in any negotiation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4). The Authority reasoned that zipper clauses could constitute one such technique because they clarify the scope and timing of negotiations. <span class="Italic">Policy Statement,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 980. That reasoning is a <span class="Italic">non sequitur</span>. The relevant question is whether the Statute explicitly or by unambiguous implication gives either party a right. If it does, that right is a unilateral right--even if doing away with it might simplify negotiations. In any event, the Authority did not present this "further support" for its Policy Statement as an alternative basis that could bear the full weight of its zipper-clause decision absent its first holding, so we cannot now view it that way. <span class="Italic">See Chenery II,</span> 332 U.S. at 196.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">* * *</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We grant the unions' petitions for review and vacate the Authority's decision in full.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v64/64-067.html">64 FLRA 426</a>, 433 (2010), reviewing an arbitration award, decided a proposal was a mandatory subject of bargaining that controlled the ability of the parties to revisit during negotiations articles that were the subject of tentative agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 19 provides that "[a]greements on individual items are tentative and must be committed to in writing and signed by each Party's chairperson." The Arbitrator concluded that the proposal is permissive because it precludes the Union from reopening articles tentatively agreed on to reflect changing circumstances. The Agency asserts that, properly interpreted, the proposal is within the mandatory duty to bargain because it is intended to permit parties to focus on remaining matters while allowing the parties to revisit tentatively agreed-upon items.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting a disputed proposal, the Authority looks to its plain meaning and any statement of the intent of the proposing party. <span class="Italic">E.g., NEA, OEA, Fort Bragg Ass'n of Educators</span>, 53 FLRA 898, 907 (1997). If the proposing party's explanation is consistent with the plain wording, then the Authority adopts the explanation for the purposes of construing what the proposal means and determining whether it is within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing, the Agency's interpretation of Section 19 is consistent with its plain wording. In this regard, written confirmation of an expressly "tentative" agreement does not explicitly or implicitly preclude subsequent adjustment. Accordingly, we adopt the Agency's explanation for purposes of construing what the proposal means. Doing <span id="page_1149"></span>so, the proposal is within the duty to bargain because it is intended as a guide for the conduct of negotiations and to further the bargaining process. <span class="Italic">See ACT</span>, 353 F.3d at 51; <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span>, 60 FLRA at 539. The proposal is a measure to provide for tentative agreement to individual items to allow the parties to focus on remaining items while acknowledging that nothing is final until negotiations are completed to allow for changing circumstances. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 209 (proposal 7) (proposed ground rules agreement, providing for tentative agreement on individual items pending agreement on entire contract, within the duty to bargain). Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the proposal is permissive is deficient.</p>
