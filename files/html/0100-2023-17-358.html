<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-356"><span class="space">e.</span> Remedies Against Unions</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA sustained an arbitration award directing public retraction by a union, through newspaper advertising, of defamatory statements made about management. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3511 and VA Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hosp.</span>, 23 FLRA 556, 560 (1986). The same result was reached concerning an improper bulletin, determined to have maligned the character of a manager in violation of the communications clause of the negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA, New York Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 3369</span>, 27 FLRA 28, 31 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA denied exceptions in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 96 and VAMC, St. Louis</span>, 47 FLRA 922, 926-29 (1993), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 47 FLRA 1246 (1993), involving the agency's successful grievance that complained the union violated the contract by distributing certain written material throughout agency facilities. The remedy directed by the arbitrator was that the union publish a retraction of an article it published in its newsletter:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to publicize matters affecting unit employees' terms and conditions of employment is encompassed within section 7102 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 34 FLRA 1129, 1135 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>). This right extends to the distribution of material in nonwork areas of an agency's property. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1135. However, a union does not have a right under the Statute to post material on agency bulletin boards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1135-36 (<span class="Italic">citing Federal Election Commission</span>, 20 FLRA 20, 21 (1985)). Such right may be established by contract, however. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1136. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 229, 231 (4th Cir. 1992) ("In the absence of [a] collective bargaining agreement, statutory protection for the distribution of union materials would normally be limited to distribution of materials in nonwork areas during non-duty hours.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the award is based, in part, on the Union's posting of the disputed newsletter article on Agency bulletin boards. As the Statute does not provide the Union a right to such use of bulletin boards, the Union's reliance on section 7102 of the Statute in support of its exception that this portion of the award is deficient is misplaced. Put simply, any Union rights to use Agency bulletin boards were established by contract. As such, at least insofar as it relates to use of the Agency's bulletin board, the award, which interprets and enforces the parties' agreement, cannot conflict with section 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2369"></span>The grievance also is based, in part, on the Union's distribution of the disputed newsletter in nonwork areas of the Agency's property. As noted previously, section 7102 of the Statute encompasses such distribution. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we conclude that the award, in this respect, does not conflict with section 7102.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the parties "deliberately negotiated" a contract provision precluding the use of Agency facilities for the "'distribution of vulgar, libelous or defamatory material directed at Agency officials....'" The Union does not dispute this conclusion. That is, the Union does not contend that the contract provision does not pertain to the distribution of the newsletter or, for any other reason, does not apply in this case. Accordingly, the issue before us, as it relates to section 7102, is whether the contract provision, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, is enforceable in arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other contract provisions addressing and limiting union rights to distribute materials have been found enforceable in arbitration.&#x2003;For example, in <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Jersey City, New Jersey and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2369</span>, 27 FLRA 104 (1987), the Authority denied a union exception that an arbitrator's award, which found that the union violated the parties' agreement by distributing a bulletin maligning an employee and ordered the union to publish a retraction, violated law and public policy. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, New York Regional Office and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3369, AFL-CIO</span>, 27 FLRA 28 (1987), the Authority denied union exceptions to an award finding that the union violated the parties' agreement by distributing certain material. The Authority noted that the union had "agreed to a limitation on its rights to publish and distribute materials in exchange for access to agency bulletin boards and facilities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision in this case prevents the Union from using Agency facilities for the distribution of vulgar, libelous, or defamatory material. The provision does not prevent the Union from posting and distributing any other type of material or from communicating with unit employees in ways which do not involve Agency facilities. Moreover, the provision does not address individual employee rights under section 7102. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Magnavox Company of Tennessee</span>, 415 U.S. 322, 325 (1974) ("The place of work is a place uniquely appropriate for dissemination of views concerning the bargaining representative....&#8197;So long as the distribution is by employees to employees and so long as the...solicitation is on nonworking time, banning of that solicitation might seriously dilute [protected] rights."). As such, we find no basis on which to conclude that the contract provision is contrary to the Statute or is otherwise unenforceable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>, 34 FLRA at 1136. Accordingly, we will deny the Union's exception that the award violates section 7102 of the Statute.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In view of our conclusion that Article 6, Section 7 of the parties' agreement is enforceable and that the award is not otherwise deficient, we find it unnecessary to address whether, in the absence of such provision, the distribution of the disputed newsletter would constitute protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute. However, for a discussion of the analytical framework and standards applied under the Statute in determining such matters,<span class="Italic"> see Department of Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Western Division San Bruno, California</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 155-57 (1992) (Member Armendariz dissenting as to other matters)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's exception that the award is contrary to public policy is based on its assertion that the award "nullif[ies] the Union's...statutory right to comment on employment matters[.]" Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above in connection with the Union's claim that the award conflicts with its rights under section 7102, we also will deny this exception.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As the disputed contract provision clearly governs the resolution of the grievance, and as we have no basis on which to conclude that the provision is not enforceable, we find irrelevant the Arbitrator's failure to find that the Union clearly and unmistakably waived its rights under section 7102. We note, in this connection, that "as a 'result of the collective bargaining and the primacy of collective bargaining agreements[,]' parties are obligated to act in accordance with those agreements." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Cincinnati, Ohio District Office</span>, 37 FLRA 1423, 1432 (1990) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union has not demonstrated that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to apply the "appropriate standard for libel under Federal law[.]" In this connection, the Agency did not argue, and the Arbitrator did not find, that the Union committed libel under Federal law. Instead, as noted previously, the Arbitrator concluded only that, by distributing the newsletter, the Union violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. That is, the Arbitrator concluded, based on his interpretation and application of the agreement, including judicial decisions, that the newsletter was "libelous" within the meaning of the agreement. Indeed, the Arbitrator specifically stated that, with respect to this issue, "[t]he standard of proof and rules of law vary considerabl[y] between civil litigation and arbitration." In these circumstances, we have no basis on which to conclude that the award is deficient as in conflict with law....</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was sustained directing a union to post a notice acknowledging violations of a contract provision regarding the need for stewards to obtain permission to meet with employees during work hours. The award also ordered conversion of time spent at improper meetings to either annual leave or nonpay status. <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr. and AFGE Local 3407</span>, 35 FLRA 1175, 1178 (1990). A union was properly enjoined from refusing to conduct arbitration hearings in certain locations found appropriate by an arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Griffiss AFB, Rome and AFGE Local 2612</span>, 38 FLRA 276, 281 (1990). An arbitrator properly directed a union to abide by contract provisions requiring verification of time and attendance reports by union officials on 100% official time. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 and Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 56 FLRA 439, 441-42 (2000). An arbitrator properly enforced a contract provision limiting a union president on official time to an eight-hour workday. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1101 and Dept. of Air Force, Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson</span>, 70 FLRA 644, 647 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring) ("The Agency explains that its purpose in filing the grievance was to try to limit its potential liability, for workers' compensation (in the event of injury) or unpaid overtime, because the president was working more than his approved official-time hours.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside, in part, that essentially punished the union for complaining to FLRA, allegedly without a reasonable basis, about the agency's failure to comply with a ULP order directed against the agency. FLRA reviewed the case under a "flagrant misconduct" standard, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R3-32 and Dept. of Air Force, Air Reserve Station Willow Grove</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-025.html">61 FLRA 127</a>, 127, 131-33 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed a grievance alleging that the Union violated the Statute and the parties' collective bargaining agreement because the Union falsely claimed in a letter to the Authority that the Agency had failed to comply with an Authority Order in an unfair labor practice (ULP) case. The Arbitrator sustained the grievance and additionally found that the Union violated the parties' agreement and the Statute by failing to respond to the grievance. As a remedy, the Arbitrator ordered that: (1) the Union post a notice stating that it had violated the Statute and the agreement; (2) the Union assign a representative to replace its President in conducting all aspects of contract administration with the Agency for a period of six months; and (3) the parties' representatives hold monthly meetings during this six-month period to identify and resolve problem areas in the administration of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Statutory Violation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's finding that the statements in the Union's letter violated the Statute is contrary to Authority precedent. The Union's letter, as well as the Union President's statements to the Union's attorney that formed the basis of the letter, were in response to the Region's request for a report on the Agency's compliance with a prior ULP Order, and, as such, were made on behalf of the Union in a representative capacity. In this respect, the Union's response to the Region's inquiry is protected and cannot be found to violate the Statute unless it: (1) constituted flagrant misconduct, or (2) "otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity." <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 58 FLRA 636 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan Air Force Base</span>). The Authority has repeatedly clarified in this regard that "flagrant misconduct" is "<span class="Italic">illustrative of," but not the only type of</span>, action that could justify removal from the protection of &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 767, 770 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring and Member Pope dissenting) (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 315th Airlift Wing v.</span> FLRA, 294 F.3d 192, 201-02 (D.C. Cir. 2002)); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Florence, Colo.</span>, 59 FLRA 165, 171 (2003); <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan Air Force Base,</span> 58 FLRA at 636. In this case, there is no showing that the Union's response constituted flagrant misconduct or that it otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Grissom Air Force Base, Ind.</span>, 51 FLRA 7 (1995), the Authority outlined several relevant factors to be considered in determining whether an employee has engaged in flagrant misconduct that is not protected under the Statute: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in anyway provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 12. The Authority also stated that the foregoing factors did not need to be cited or applied in any particular way in determining whether an action constitutes flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, in making such determinations, the Authority has held that "[u]nion officials acting in their official capacity have very broad latitude in speech and action." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn.</span>, 57 <span id="page_2370"></span>FLRA 343, 345 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Oak Ridge</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (false incident report filed by shop chairman protected); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Tex.</span>, 46 FLRA 978, 993-94 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Randolph Air Force Base</span>) (Authority adopted Judge's finding that knowingly false statements made by union official not removed from protection of the Statute); <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency</span>, 50 FLRA 212, 216 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DLA</span>) (letter from union official to employees accusing supervisors of lying and overbearing and abusive treatment of subordinates protected).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above precedent, we find that the Arbitrator's finding, without any elaboration, that the statements were false, does not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that the statements constituted flagrant misconduct or otherwise lost protection of the Statute. With regard to flagrant misconduct, application of the <span class="Italic">Grissom</span> factors weighs against such a conclusion because the Union's allegations related solely to a labor-management relations matter, were not publicly made, and were confined to appropriate officials of the Boston Regional Office and witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DLA</span>, 50 FLRA at 216 (complaint not publicly announced); <span class="Italic">Randolph Air Force Base,</span> 46 FLRA, at 996-97 (1992) (letter not published); <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 7 FLRA 596, 603-604 (1982) (name calling as part of labor-management dispute). Moreover, the Union's letter was written in response to the Authority's inquiry regarding the Agency's compliance with a prior ULP Order and contained no intemperate language. At worst, the statements in the Union's response reflected an incorrect interpretation of the Agency's obligations to bargain with the Union over changes in employees' work times. As such, without regard to whether the Union's letter was impulsive or provoked, it did not constitute flagrant misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, there is nothing in the record that indicates that the erroneous statements in the Union's letter otherwise exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we set aside the portion of the award finding that the Union's letter to the Authority violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Contractual Violation</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's related finding, that the Union's letter to the Authority violated the parties' agreement, is contrary to &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n</span>, 21 FLRA at 759-60, the Authority found deficient an arbitrator's award that sustained a grievance alleging that a union's action violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement where the union's actions were protected by &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. Similarly, here, we find deficient the Arbitrator's award that the Union's letter violated the parties' contract, where the Union President's response to an official inquiry by the Authority's Regional Office involves the legitimate conduct of an employee, acting in a representative capacity, that is protected under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute. Moreover, since no clear and unmistakable waiver of these rights under &#x00A7; 7102 is alleged in this case, there is no basis for the Arbitrator's finding of a contract violation. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Indian Head Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 848, 850 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.</span>) (Authority precedent requires that the waiver of a statutory right must be clear and unmistakable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we set aside the Arbitrator's award finding that the Union's letter to the Authority violated the parties' agreement as contrary to &#x00A7; 7102.</p>
