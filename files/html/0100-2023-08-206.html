<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-204"><span class="space">b.</span> Nonselection</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonselections are generally nonappealable, with exceptions, <span class="Italic">Greenlaw v. Dept. of Labor</span>, SF-3443-17-0089-I-1 (NP 1/26/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a nonselection is not appealable directly to the Board. <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. Office of Management &#x0026; Budget</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 665, &#x00B6; 6 (2012). However, as the administrative judge correctly informed the appellant, there are exceptions to this general rule. These exceptions allow an individual to appeal her nonselection when the agency's decision was (1) made in retaliation for her protected disclosures, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8); (2) made in retaliation for her protected activities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9); (3) the product of discrimination based on uniformed service, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311; (4) in violation of her veterans' preference rights, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1); or (5) in violation of the basic requirements set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant seemed to assert that the agency's decision regarding her nonselection violated of the basic requirements set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. As the administrative judge informed the appellant, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over such a claim, an appellant must (1) demonstrate that it concerns an "employment practice" that the Office of Personnel Management is involved in administering and (2) nonfrivolously allege that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 15(2011). The appellant has failed to make anything more than a bare assertion that the agency violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to establish her right to a jurisdictional hearing in this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 157, 160 &#x0026; n.3 (1993), aff'd, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Monasteri v. MSPB</span>, 232 F.3d 1376, 1379-40 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (whistleblowing reprisal cases aside, the agency's failure to select an applicant for a vacancy is not generally appealable to the MSPB); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. DOD</span>, 78 MSPR 58, 61 (1998) (nonselection for a promotion is not appealable); <span class="Italic">Tuleja v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 681, 683 (1997) (other than in IRA cases, reassignment or nonselection for promotion is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> appealable to the Board); <span class="Italic">Woodmaska v. Dept. of Energy</span>, DC-3443-16-0372-I-1 (NP 9/28/2016)("It is well settled that the Board generally <span id="Page_325"></span>does not have jurisdiction to review an agency's decision not to select a particular applicant for a position. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). Exceptions to this rule exist for individual right of action appeals under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) and for claims under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) or the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333) (USERRA). <span class="Italic">See Becker v.

<p class="Body-Text">Sources of Board jurisdiction over nonselection cases were summarized, <span class="Italic">Carroll v. OPM,</span> CH-3443-16-0042-I-1 (NP 4/12/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Thus, it follows that the Board does not have jurisdiction over all matters alleged to be unfair or incorrect. <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Department of the Army</span>, 168 F.3d 22, 23-24 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board's appellate jurisdiction is set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3. It is well settled that the Board generally does not have jurisdiction to review an agency's decision not to select a particular applicant for a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 314, 318 (2002); <span class="Italic">Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 93 (1992). As the administrative judge correctly explained, there are exceptions to this general rule, i.e., when that nonselection was made in retaliation for whistleblowing, was the product of discrimination based on the applicant's uniformed service, or violated any of his veterans' preference rights, and the appellant has the burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction by making nonfrivolous allegations of fact that, if proven, would show that his claims fell within one of those exceptions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.57. The appellant did not allege any of those bases in his appeal, and he did not respond to the administrative judge's acknowledgment orders.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The limited jurisdiction over nonselections was restated, <span class="Italic">Findlay v. Dept. of Labor</span>, DC-3443-16-0073-I-1 (NP 8/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated in the initial decision, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. ID at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985)). Nonselection is not an appealable adverse action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(d). However, an employee may appeal his nonselection for a position or a promotion by other statutory means, such as under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, if he claims that the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, if he claims discrimination based on his uniformed service, or through an individual right of action appeal, if he claims retaliation for whistleblowing or certain protected activity. <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12 (2007). As was the case in the appellant's numerous responses below, he has provided no evidence or argument in his petition for review that would support a finding of Board jurisdiction on any of these grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's negative suitability determination claim against the agency is not an appealable action. As stated in the initial decision, the relevant suitability regulations provide that a nonselection for a specific position is not an appealable suitability action. ID at 3 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203). The administrative judge properly concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under Hill v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-3443-17-0371-I-1 (NP 1/27/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the appellant argues that her nonselection violated the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the sex discrimination provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, thereby violating several of the merit system principles of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b). See 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 206(d); 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). However, even if this is true, it is insufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over the appeal. The merit system principles are not self-executing, and they do not provide an independent basis for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 15 (2007); <span class="Italic">Corbett v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 431, 434 (1981). Furthermore, even if the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), this would not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction either. <span class="Italic">Imdahl v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 453, 456 (1996); <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted of nonselections, and the relation of nonselections to suitability appeals (discussed later in this chapter), <span class="Italic">Soe v. MSPB</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 615, 618 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn next to Mr. Soe's contention that the Postal Service improperly refused to hire him as a Rural Carrier Associate and deemed him unsuitable for the position. Mr. Soe states that his "application [was] clear," that the agency "did not hire" him, and that he "wish[es] to [be] consider[ed]" for the Rural Carrier Associate position. We view these statements, as the Board did, as a challenge to his nonselection by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"As this court has previously noted, '[a]n agency's failure to select an applicant for a vacant position is generally not appealable to the Board.'" <span class="Italic">Monasteri v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 232 F.3d 1376, 1379-80 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998)); <span class="Italic">see also Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[N]o law, rule, or regulation authorizes a direct appeal to the Board respecting a nonselection for promotion...."); <span class="Italic">Diamond v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 448, 450 (1991) ("[The] Board's jurisdiction is limited to that conferred by law, rule, or regulation, and there is no law, rule, or regulation that confers jurisdiction to review nonselection for a position."). While the Board may have jurisdiction over an agency's refusal to appoint or promote in some circumstances (for example, if the agency was retaliating against the individual because he or she made a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Protection Act or if the agency violated a veteran's preference in its nonselection), Mr. Soe has not alleged such circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some cases, the Board does have jurisdiction over agency findings of unsuitability. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501. Those circumstances are limited to cases where the employee is in the competitive service or Senior Executive Service, however. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b) ("Covered position means a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service."). As we have previously stated, the "Postal Service is an excepted service." <span class="Italic">Palumbo v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 168 F.3d 1316 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Daisy v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 15, 19 (1995) ("Postal Service employees have not been part of the competitive service since the enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970."). Further, Mr. Soe clearly did not have a career appointment to the Senior Executive Service. Overall, then, the Board correctly found it did not have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Soe's claims based on nonselection or a determination of negative suitability.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Gregory v. MSPB</span>, 469 Fed. Appx. 891, 893-94 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), reached a similar result when the appellant was given a tentative offer of employment that was withdrawn based on unfavorable information gained by the agency during a security check:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, the GSA's hiring decision cannot be considered an appealable suitability action under the clear terms of &#x00A7; 731.203(b), and its use of the word "suitability" in providing notice to Gregory does not alter the substance of the GSA's actions. As the Board correctly noted, there is no evidence that Gregory was removed or debarred from any position, that his reinstatement eligibility was cancelled, or that his eligibility was cancelled for any position other than the specific position he sought with the GSA. In short, the GSA's decision amounted to nothing more than a non-selection for employment, which is generally not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Gregory also contends that his acceptance of the GSA's tentative offer resulted in an enforceable employment contract, which the agency then breached upon rescinding that offer. First, the GSA's tentative offer was just that--a <span class="Italic">tentative</span> offer that, on its face, was conditioned on satisfactory results of a pending security check. When those results proved unsatisfactory, the offer was withdrawn, Gregory was never appointed to the position, and he never entered on duty. At no point did a contractual relationship arise. Moreover, even if Gregory had been hired, federal employment follows a system of appointment that is, absent an explicit statutory exception, governed by statute and regulation rather than contractual obligation. <span class="Italic">See Chu v. United States</span>, 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985). We therefore reject Gregory's breach of contract theory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A nonappealable nonselection does not become an appealable suitability action unless the procedures and determinants set by OPM suitability regulations are involved, <span class="Italic">Kappelman v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> CH-0731-10-0603-I-1 (NP 12/14/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly concluded that the Board had no jurisdiction over the appellant's non-selection. Generally, an unsuccessful candidate for a federal civil service position has no right to appeal his non-selection. <span class="Italic">Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 93 (1992). Furthermore, while the Board has jurisdiction over certain matters involving "suitability" for federal employment, <span class="Italic">see Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 7 (2009), these are limited to "suitability actions" defined as a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, or a debarment. <span id="Page_326"></span><span class="Italic">See Kazan v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6 (2009); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.501(a), 731.203(a). In fact, OPM's regulations specify that a non-selection for a specific position is not a "suitability action," even if it is based on the criteria for making suitability determinations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b); <span class="Italic">see also Upshaw</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8 (under the current regulations, "denial of appointment" is not on the list of actions appealable to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision letter here simply withdraws the appellant's tentative job offer for the position of Special Agent. The Board has indicated that such a non-selection does not amount to a suitability action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See generally Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 7 (the agency decision that the appellant was ineligible for the position of Aviation Security Officer appears outside the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">see also Alvarez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 8 (2009) (agency decision finding the appellant unsuitable for Customs and Border Protection Officer position appears outside the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10 (2009) (agency decision finding the appellant unsuitable for Customs and Border Protection Agricultural Specialist position appears outside the Board's jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the agency did not take any broader action regarding the appellant's eligibility for federal positions, such as debarment or canceling any other eligibilities on other existing competitive registers. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Riggsbee v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 2 (2009) (referring to OPM's cancellation of eligibilities "on existing competitive registers"); <span class="Italic">Sazegari v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 254, &#x00B6; 2 (2006) (noting that OPM rated the appellant ineligible for the position of Immigration Inspector and cancelled any other eligibilities he may have obtained). Indeed, the opposite appears true, as the agency's e-mail correspondence with the appellant states that he may apply for the next open position. Therefore, the agency's action is a simple non-selection for a specific position, an action outside the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's discrimination and harmful procedural error claims, neither claim provides a basis for Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See generally Tardio v. Department of Justice</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 31 (2009) (a claim of agency discrimination does not provide an independent source of Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Deans v. Department of Labor,</span> 15 M.S.P.R. 326, 327 (1983) (a claim that the agency committed a harmful procedural error is an affirmative defense that does not create an independent source of Board jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Jeanmarie v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-3330-14-0445-I-1 (NP 3/20/2015) ("A suitability determination by definition applies to more than one position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b).

Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). As the administrative judge correctly found, the agency's withdrawal of the employment offer resulted in the denial of the appointment and the non-selection of the appellant for the position in Guam. Consequently, no suitability action took place here.").

<p class="Body-Text">The withdrawal of an offer does not require due process enforceable through a Board appeal, as <span class="Italic">Hopkins v. DOJ</span>, DE-3443-16-0406-I-1 (NP 10/13/2016), explained concerning an appellant who received an offer conditioned on a background investigation, left his then-current agency, relocated, and then found he had no job at all when the agency decided it did not desire to complete the background investigation process, gave no firm reporting date to the appellant, and withdrew the offer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was selected for a GS-11 Human Resources Specialist position in Fargo, North Dakota. On June 13, 2016, the agency sent him an email containing a "formal offer" and informed him that someone would be in touch with him concerning a background check. Less than 15 minutes later, the agency's District Office Security Manager sent the appellant an email to begin the background investigation process. This email stated "Prior to your start date, your background must be completed." In a follow-up email dated that same day, the Security Manager stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I [realize] your desired start date is July 10th; however, the background investigation process to obtain a prehire waiver that is required for you to start prior to the actual investigation completion takes approximately four to six weeks. The actual background investigation takes four to six months to complete....July 10, 2016 is not a set in stone start date, it's a desired date[;] please do not make plans to start on that date until you hear further from me.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two weeks later, when the agency began to arrange the appellant's release from his employing agency (the Department of Veterans Affairs in Beckley, West Virginia), the agency again informed the appellant "we cannot gain you to our agency until the background investigation is cleared." The appellant replied, "I understand about the investigation but I had to make a command decision on giving notice where I live....I'll be in Fargo this weekend." The appellant then moved at his own expense from West Virginia to Fargo, and his employing agency obtained permission to back-fill his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the early stages of the background check investigation revealed some information that was not resolved to the agency's satisfaction and made it unwilling to sign a Pre-employment National Security Background Waiver. The agency therefore withdrew the offer of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below and reiterates on review that the agency's firm offer could not be withdrawn without affording him due process. He cites no legal authority for this proposition, and we are aware of none. He further contends that he made Permanent Change of Station (PCS) arrangements and that the offer was falsely portrayed as a tentative offer. We disagree. The firm offer email did not contain the word "tentative." However, the vacancy announcement stated that the position required the successful completion of a background investigation, and the appellant received numerous emails, beginning only a few minutes after the firm offer email, from the agency indicating that he was required to complete a background investigation before he could come on board. The appellant specifically stated that he understood. In order to be appointed to a position in the civil service, an authorized appointing official must formally and unequivocally act to appoint that individual. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. General Services Administration</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 120, 122 (1992). Although the appellant was selected for the position, the actual appointment was subject to the successful completion of a background investigation; because he did not meet this condition, his selection did not amount to an appointment. <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 123. Under the circumstances, the right to due process did not attach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, by describing his relocation in terms of PCS arrangements, the appellant implied that there was some sort of official involvement or responsibility in his move to Fargo. On the contrary, the appellant was well aware that the agency would not pay relocation expenses. The vacancy announcement explicitly stated that relocation expenses would not be authorized. Further, when the appellant received an automatically generated email from a "PCS Travel Portal" that had been sent in error, he contacted the agency because he did not expect that he would receive relocation expenses. Even though the agency specifically instructed him that his proposed start date was not set in stone and that the preliminary background investigation process would take 4 to 6 weeks, he chose to relocate. The consequences of that decision are his responsibility.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Despite the general lack of Board jurisdiction over a non-selection, an appellant may appeal his non-selection for a promotion by other statutory means, such as through a VEOA appeal." <span class="Italic">Becker v. VA</span>, 112 MSPR 507, 510 &#x00B6; 6, 2009 MSPB 204 (2009). The Whistleblower Protection Act provides direct access to the Board following initial review by OSC for challenges to certain actions claimed to be whistleblowing reprisal. That statute, 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv), includes detail, transfer, or reassignment as personnel actions; subsection (a)(2)(A)(xi) includes as a personnel action "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">Cf. Crary v. FAA</span>, 1 MSPR 453, 454, 1 MSPB 438 (1980) (for whistleblowing reprisal cases prior to the 1989 WPA, no appeal would lie to MSPB but a complaint could have been initiated with OSC). An IRA challenge may be lodged for many other types of otherwise unappealable actions described in this section, assuming prior resort to OSC and an allegation of reprisal for whistleblowing. A USERRA appeal could assert nonselection based on past or present military service. But a federal district court directed EEOC to employ an attorney who was given a firm offer that he accepted and who then wound down his law practice before learning that EEOC would not place him in the position because of a hiring freeze. <span class="Italic">Beacom v. EEOC</span>, 500 F. Supp. 428 (D. Ariz. 1980).
