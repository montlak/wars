<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-156"><span class="space">3.</span> Challenge to Court Order Affecting Annuity Interest</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB does not revise court orders that are challenged by an appellant, although provisions in the orders clearly contrary to OPM regulations governing distribution of annuities may be disregarded. If there is a challenge to a court order, one must go to the court that issued the order to obtain a revision or correction of the order under challenge, <span class="Italic">Adler v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 651, 655-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13, 2010 MSPB 193 (2010) (<span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Adler v. OPM</span>, 437 Fed. Appx. 928 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP)<span class="Italic">, post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his former spouse is not entitled to the portion of his annuity benefits awarded by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6; 14 (2010). A preponderance of the evidence is that degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to find that a contested fact is more likely to be true than untrue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(q)] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the appellant contests the validity of the Order, he has selected the wrong forum for pursuing his challenge. OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.224 sets forth the following procedures for contesting the validity of court orders affecting lifetime annuities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;An employee, separated employee, or retiree who alleges that a court order is invalid must prove the invalidity of the court order by submitting a court order that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Declares the court order submitted by the former spouse is invalid; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Sets aside the court order submitted by the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;OPM must honor a court order acceptable for processing that appears to be valid and that the former spouse has certified is currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside, until OPM receives a court order described in paragraph (a) of this section or a court order amending or superseding the court order submitted by the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not obtained a court order declaring the Order invalid or setting it aside, and the Board, not being a court, cannot issue such an order. In any event, the Board lacks the authority to review actions by state courts. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that OPM was correct in its determination that the Order is suitable for processing and awards Ms. Baker a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> share of the appellant's gross annuity. With respect to the apportionment of a lifetime annuity, a court order must meet the minimum requirements of 5 C.F.R. part 838 subpart C to be a court order acceptable for processing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.103. The record reflects that the Order satisfies those requirements. As required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.303, the Order identifies the retirement system at issue and expressly states that Ms. Baker is entitled to a portion of the appellant's annuity, using terms approved under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.612. The Order also expressly directs OPM to pay the marital share directly to Ms. Baker, thereby satisfying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.304. In addition, as discussed further below, the Order provides OPM sufficient instructions to compute Ms. Baker's share as a fraction of the appellant's gross annuity. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.305(b)(1)(ii); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.306, 838.621(b). Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the Order is not improperly labeled as a QDRO, and even if it were, it would still be acceptable for processing because it refers to 5 C.F.R. part 838 and states that the provisions concerning the apportionment of CSRS benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in that part. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.302(a)(2)(i) and (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to lifetime benefits, the Order supersedes the original divorce decree. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.134(a)(2) (when two or more court orders relate to the same former spouse, the one issued last will be honored). In interpreting the terms of a court order which awards a former spouse a share of a CSRS annuity, OPM applies the regulations under 5 C.F.R. part 838 subpart F. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.102(4), 838.601(a). Among those regulations is 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.621, which provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Prorata share</span> means one-half of the fraction whose numerator is the number of months of Federal civilian and military service that the employee performed during the marriage and whose denominator is the total number of months of Federal civilian and military service performed by the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;A court order that awards a former spouse a <span class="Italic">prorata</span> share of an employee annuity...by using the term '<span class="Italic">prorata</span> share' and identifying the date when the marriage began satisfies the requirements of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.305...and awards the former spouse a <span class="Italic">prorata</span> share as defined by paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Order uses the term "<span class="Italic">prorata</span> share" and identifies the date the appellant and Ms. Baker were married, OPM correctly interpreted the Order to award Ms. Baker a share equal to one-half of the fraction for which the numerator is the appellant's 273 months of Federal service while married to Ms. Baker, and for which the denominator is his 287 total months of Federal service, or 47.56 percent.[5] Although OPM's letter of August 31, 1998, refers to a denominator of 296 months, it is evident that this was a typographical error and did not enter into the actual computation. We therefore find that it is unnecessary to remand the matter to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM was also correct not to give effect to the language in the Order that purported to add 24 months of premarital military service to the numerator. Even if the appellant had in fact served 24 months in the military before marrying Ms. Baker, that portion of the Order would still be inoperative, because OPM was bound under &#x00A7; 838.621(b) to apply the definition of <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> share at &#x00A7; 838.621(a), which requires that the numerator of the fraction used to calculate the share include only service performed while married.<span class="Italic"> Cf. Hamilton,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 439, 1117 (a former spouse was entitled to a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> share as defined by regulation, notwithstanding language in the court order purporting to award a 55 percent share of the appellant's annuity as of the date of separation). The factual error in the Order language is therefore of no consequence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the administrative judge did not specifically address the appellant's claims of various regulatory violations. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, resolve issues of credibility, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and her legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests). In particular, the appellant objects that Ms. Baker's application for benefits was not in compliance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.221(b), which requires, in addition to a certified copy of the court order, a certification from the former spouse or the former spouse's representative that the court order is currently in force and has not been amended, superseded, or set aside. The appellant further asserts that OPM failed to note the date of receipt on the Order, as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.131(2). We find, however, that the appellant has not shown that the alleged procedural errors were likely to have caused OPM to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). The appellant also alleges that OPM failed to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.1004, 838.1008, and 838.1009; however, these regulations pertain only to court orders received by OPM before January 1, 1993, and therefore have no relevance to this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 439, &#x00B6; 15 n.1; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.101(c)(2), 838.102(a)(6). Finally, because the Board lacks the authority to review the actions of the Oconto County Circuit Court, we cannot consider the appellant's claim that the court failed to satisfy its obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.122.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adler</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Adler v. OPM</span>, 437 Fed. Appx. 928, 930-32 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adler contests the validity and the constitutionality of the Wisconsin Order. Mr. Adler also contends that OPM violated several of its own regulations and improperly processed the Wisconsin Order. Ultimately, Mr. Adler believes that these alleged violations should result in the return of all retirement payments made to his former spouse, Ms. Baker, and should block any attempt by Ms. Baker to seek retirement benefits in the future. This court, like the Board, finds Mr. Adler's arguments either outside the scope of our review or without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1), annuity payments otherwise payable to a retired employee shall be paid to the employee's former spouse</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">'[i]f and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation[.] '"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Perry v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 243 F.3d 1337, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In order to receive a portion of a former spouse's benefits, the applicant must <span id="Page_4351"></span>"apply in writing" to OPM and include a "certified copy of the court order" authorizing the apportionment along with certification that the order is "currently in force." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.221. A court order qualifies for processing when it identifies the retirement system under which the annuity exists and "expressly state[s] the portion to which the former spouse is entitled under the court order." <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 243 F.3d at 1349-40; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.303. The regulations provide that "[g]enerally, OPM must comply with court orders...in connection with divorces...that award a portion of the former employee's or Member's retirement benefits...to a former spouse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(1). In so doing, OPM's task is "purely ministerial" as the agency "must honor the clear instructions of the court." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 838.101(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adler's main contention is that OPM violated his constitutional rights to due process and equal protection under the law when it enforced the Wisconsin Order. He contends that "he was unaware that the Order was being written and was not represented in the matter." These arguments are outside this court's scope of review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has previously pointed out that "the regulations put [the] burden [of challenging the validity of a state court order] squarely in the state courts." <span class="Italic">Snyder v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 136 F.3d 1474, 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.124). OPM informed Mr. Adler multiple times that it was required to follow the Wisconsin Order absent an amended or superseding court order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.224. The Administrative Judge further informed Mr. Adler that if he desired to appeal the Wisconsin Order in the state courts, the current case could be dismissed without prejudice, allowing Mr. Adler to refile in the event that his appeal was successful. Mr. Adler declined.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of this court's review of Board decisions is limited to determining if "agency action, findings, or conclusions" are "not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). This court cannot now consider a collateral constitutional challenge to the Wisconsin Order which OPM was obligated to follow. <span class="Italic">Snyder</span>, 136 F.3d at 1479. The proper forum for a constitutional challenge to the Wisconsin Order is a Wisconsin state court. <span class="Italic">Cf. Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.</span>, 420 U.S. 592, 606 (1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adler also contends that his constitutional rights were violated when OPM directly communicated with his former spouse without his knowledge. The Wisconsin Order, though, specifically instructed OPM to issue Ms. Baker her share "directly," so OPM naturally communicated directly with her. As to the alleged communications between OPM that took place following the divorce decree but before the Order, Mr. Adler frames his argument as a constitutional challenge to the underlying Order. Any arguments concerning the constitutionality of the Wisconsin Order, as explained above, should have been brought before a Wisconsin state court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adler also takes issue with OPM's processing of the Wisconsin Order. Mr. Adler contends that because the Order erroneously refers to his military service, when he did not in fact serve in the military, the Order is "false" and cannot be implemented by OPM. Despite the erroneous mention of military service, OPM was correct in processing the Wisconsin Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Wisconsin Order identified the particular retirement system from which the payments would be directed to Ms. Baker, the CSRS, and instructed how to calculate Ms. Baker's share. The Order instructed OPM to award Ms. Baker a <span class="Italic">pro rata</span> share of Mr. Adler's retirement, based on a ratio where the denominator was Mr. Adler's total number of months of federal service and the numerator was the number of months of federal service while married to Ms. Baker. By calculating the ratio using the correct number of total months and excluding the military service, OPM followed the terms "expressly provided for" in the Wisconsin order. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1). This court views the mention of 296 months in OPM's explanatory letter as a typographical error that did not impact the actual calculation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Adler also contends that OPM should not have processed the Wisconsin Order because it was not accompanied by a certification stating it was currently in force, as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.221(b). To the extent this was an error, it was harmless. After informing Mr. Adler in July of 1998 that it was bound to apply the Order absent an amended or superseding Order, OPM was effectively on notice that the Order was in force by the lack of a response from Mr. Adler.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Strangely, Mr. Adler contends that OPM erred by not awarding Ms. Baker a share of his survivor annuity, as stated in the Order. OPM found that the portion of the Order referencing the survivor annuity was not acceptable for processing because it was issued after Mr. Adler retired, contrary to regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(a); [A76] . This court agrees, and therefore finds no merit to the argument that this somehow implicates the validity of the Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Adler contends that OPM has violated several procedures and regulations. Most of these regulations, though, do not apply to Mr. Adler's case because they concern court orders submitted to OPM prior to 1993. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.101(c). None of the alleged violations, though, have in any way affected OPM's processing of the Order. For example, Mr. Adler contends that OPM failed to properly designate and inform him of the replacement representative handling his matter. This and similar contentions in no way alter the outcome of Mr. Adler's case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of resolution by a state court of conflicting divorce decrees is provided by <span class="Italic">Emond v. OPM</span>, 644 Fed. Appx. 1013, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A government employee who pays for survivor annuity benefits can elect to have those benefits distributed to a former spouse, or such benefits can be awarded pursuant to a court order, such as a divorce decree. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 842.604(g), 838.701(a). A person adversely affected by a court order who alleges that the order is invalid must prove its invalidity and may do so by submitting to OPM a different court order that declares invalid the original order submitted by the former spouse. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.724(a)(1). State courts are responsible for determining when court orders are invalid. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 838.122(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia issued an order explicitly stating that Ms. Emond's version of the divorce decree "is not a true and accurate copy," while the version submitted in connection with Leona Burns' application is "true and accurate." Because OPM's original award of former spouse survivor benefits was based on the terms of a divorce decree that was subsequently found to be inaccurate by the Virginia court, the MSPB determined that Ms. Emond was not eligible for a survivor annuity. Ms. Emond argues that the Virginia court order did not "invalidate" the divorce decree she submitted. The MSPB properly rejected this argument, which is more semantic than substantive. The Virginia court's order, while not formally invalidating the earlier order, explicitly determined that Ms. Emond's version of the divorce decree was not a "true and accurate copy." The MSPB's determination that Ms. Emond is not entitled to a survivor annuity is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reid v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-13-0010-B-1 (NP 6/24/2014) ("Here, the appellant filed a pleading with the appropriate Georgia state court seeking to nullify the divorce decree, but the court denied his request. Therefore, the appellant failed to obtain a court order declaring the divorce decree invalid or setting it aside, and the Board, not being a court, cannot issue such an order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 437 F. App'x 928 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Accordingly, the Board must honor the divorce decree. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.224(b).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not revise an unambiguous court order based on equitable considerations, <span class="Italic">Irving v. OPM</span>, DE-0843-16-0327-I-1 (NP 7/13/2022) (decree awarding the former spouse $1/month):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further claims on review that she was not in her best mental state when she signed the divorce papers. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> She was, however, represented by counsel during the divorce proceedings and when she signed the court order at issue here, including the provision she now challenges, which, she acknowledges, assured that she would continue to have needed health benefits following the divorce. To the extent the appellant now seeks to substitute terms in the order that would be more favorable to her, any such modification is precluded because of her former husband's death. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.806(b)(1). In any event, the appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues on review that the order, as enforced by OPM, is patently unfair and inequitable. While we are sympathetic, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the Government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990).</p>
