<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-521"><span class="space">3.</span> Size and Use of Offices</h4>
<p class="noindent">Disputed in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 83 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 403-414 (1990), was a proposal that employees affected by an office move "have at least 64 feet of contiguous work space"--a proposal FLRA pronounced negotiable. The proposal did not interfere with the right of the agency to determine the technology used in performing work: the agency did not show a technological relation between the conservation of work space and the performance of agency work. That an action may promote economy of operations does not bring it within the scope of the right to determine the technology of performing work. The proposal did not directly interfere with the methods and means of performing work: there was no showing that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose leading to the method or means adopted. The proposal did not interfere with the agency's right to determine its organization. The decision should be read in its entirety for a full understanding of the intricate reasoning behind each of the Authority's conclusions. The bottom line was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal in this case involves office environment--a matter "at the very heart of the traditional meaning of 'conditions of employment.'"... The Authority has found, generally, that proposals concerning reductions in space, space allocation, and the arrangement of space concern conditions of employment and are negotiable unless an agency demonstrates that the proposals are inconsistent with applicable law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 FLRA 979, 981 (1987). More specifically, the Authority found that a proposal concerning office size was negotiable because, in the absence of a showing that a technical relationship existed between office size and the performance of agency work, office size was merely incidental to the performance of the agency's work but was principally related to matters affecting working conditions. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2477 and Library of Congress</span>, 7 FLRA 578, 583 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd as to other matters</span>, <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983). On the other hand, the Authority found a proposal concerning office size nonnegotiable when, and because, the amount of space proposed was inconsistent with the...GSA space reduction regulation... [A] Government-wide regulation.... <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 FLRA 363 (1987)....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 70 FLRA 932, 934 n.23 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) ("To the extent that other Authority decisions selectively cited by the dissent have diverged from this clear test--under which determining an employee's <span class="Italic">official duty station</span> necessarily affects management's right to determine the agency's organization--we will no longer follow them. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Educ., Wash., D.C</span>., 61 FLRA 307, 309-310 (2005) (<span class="Italic">DOE</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1286-88 (1991); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3601</span>, 39 FLRA 504, 515-16 (1991); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 411-413 (1990). Those decisions failed to recognize that, every time an employee's official duty station changes, that change necessarily affects an agency's 'administrative structure.'").</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable was Proposal 9, that employees be guaranteed a minimum of 100 square feet of office or work space, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 43 FLRA 1442, 1449-52 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 9 is within the Agency's duty to bargain because it is not inconsistent with law or GSA regulations and because it does not directly interfere with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Is Not Inconsistent with Law or GSA Regulations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section A of the proposal requires the Agency to guarantee each employee a minimum of 100 square feet of office space.&#x2003;Section B further requires that this minimum space figure be met if there are any renovations of the Agency's offices or any office moves. The Agency claims that these sections of the proposal are inconsistent with GSA regulations for two reasons: (1) GSA controls the acquisition and assignment of office space and the Agency cannot guarantee the square footage per employee required by the proposal; and (2) the regulations allow a particular amount of space based on employees' grade levels and the proposal fails to take grade levels into account. The Agency also argues that section C is inconsistent with GSA regulations to the extent that that section requires negotiations over minimum square footage, and is inconsistent with law, to the extent it requires bargaining over other office and space changes. We reject the Agency's assertions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we reject the Agency's contention that the proposal is nonnegotiable because GSA controls the acquisition and assignment of office space. It is well established that an agency is obligated to bargain to the extent it has discretion to bargain on otherwise negotiable matters. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2477, et al. and Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.</span>, 7 FLRA 578 (1982), <span class="Italic">enf'd sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom. Library of Congress v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>). In <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, the court affirmed the Authority's findings that the agency was obligated to bargain over changes in office design and office environment even if the bargaining obligation was limited to making recommendations to the entity that was responsible for effecting the changes sought by the proposals. We reach the same conclusion here. There is nothing to prevent the Agency from requesting GSA to acquire and/or assign a sufficient amount of space to meet the proposal's specifications. In fact, the Agency concedes that it has the authority to request office space from GSA. To the extent the amount of space available to employees is controlled by GSA, therefore, the proposal merely requires the Agency to request that GSA furnish a sufficient amount of space.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's contention that 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-17.304-1 controls the allocation of square footage based on employee grade levels. The pertinent GSA regulations do not prescribe either a mandatory or maximum square footage figure per grade level. Instead, 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-17.303(b) states that the space allowances listed in 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101-17.304-1 "shall not necessarily be used as criteria for assigning space to individuals. Rather, they should be used to estimate that portion of the total office space that is required for work stations." Thus, the express language of the regulation provides that the square footage figures for each grade level are intended as estimates, and not as mandatory amounts. Consequently, as there is no requirement that space allocations match employees' grade levels in prescribed amounts, the proposal is not inconsistent with the cited GSA regulation. Moreover, we note that GSA has established "an average adjusted utilization rate of 135 square feet or less per person," with certain exceptions not relevant here. <span class="Italic">See</span> 56 Fed. Reg. 42164 (1991). There is no evidence in the record that a particular utilization rate exists at the Agency and there is no basis on which to conclude that bargaining over the proposed amount of square footage per person, which amount falls within the utilization rate established by GSA, is proscribed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Agency's assertion that Section C is contrary to law inasmuch as it requires bargaining over all office and space changes. The Agency claims that it would be obligated to negotiate without regard to <span id="page_1008"></span>whether such changes are insignificant or whether they involve working conditions of unit employees.... As explained by the Union, Section C is designed to require bargaining consistent with the Agency's bargaining obligations. As there is no basis on which to conclude that the Agency would be compelled to negotiate in a manner inconsistent with its bargaining obligations under the Statute, we find that section C is not contrary to law, as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Proposal Does Not Interfere with Management's Rights under Section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (b)(1) of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that sections A and B of the proposal would interfere with its rights to hire, assign, direct, and layoff employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and with the right to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. The Agency maintains that if it agrees to provide 100 square feet of space per employee, and it remains in its present office location, future changes in personnel will cause the Agency to take one of the following actions: violate the terms of the agreement by reducing space to accommodate new hires; adhere to the agreement but eliminate other space and personnel from the Agency; or be unable to hire additional personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections A and B of the proposal do not specifically address the management rights with which the proposal is alleged to be inconsistent.&#x2003;Rather, these sections are concerned with providing a certain amount of space per employee and ensuring the maintenance of that space following office renovations or relocations. As we have stated often, proposals relating to the office environment are at the very heart of the traditional meaning of 'conditions of employment.'"... In our view, the Agency's arguments relate to the merits of the proposal, that is, to the advisability of providing 100 square feet of space per employee....</p>
<p class="noindent">It was determined in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3601 and DHHS, Pub. Health Serv., Indian Hosp., Claremont, Okla.</span>, 36 FLRA 224, 225-26 (1990), concerning a proposal that the employer agree "to provide a private office for the Medical Staff Quality Assurance employee":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals concerning reductions in office space, space allocation, and the arrangement of space concern conditions of employment and are negotiable unless an agency demonstrates that the proposals are inconsistent with applicable law or regulation.... The Authority has found that proposals granting employees private offices are negotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency makes no claim, and it is not otherwise apparent, that this proposal...is inconsistent with law, Government-wide rule or regulation, or an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists. The parties bear the burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a decision....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the agency provide a private office for the "Medical Staff Quality Assurance employee." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3601 and DHHS, Pub. Health Serv., Indian Hosp., Claremore</span>, 39 FLRA 504, 511-18 (1991). FLRA rejected arguments that: the proposal interfered with the agency's ability to determine the technology and methods of performing work (there having been no showing relating the location of the employee's office and the performance of agency work); the proposal interfered with the agency's right to determine its organization and mission; and the proposal interfered with the right of the agency to assign employees and work. <span class="Italic">See NFFE Local 2050 and EPA</span>, 39 FLRA 291 (1991) (proposals negotiable requiring that: under various conditions certain employees be relocated to space containing windows; the agency install automatic garage doors with an alarm system; offices have doors with combination locks; and certain employees be provided private offices). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">DLA and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 70 FLRA 932, 934 n.23 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) ("To the extent that other Authority decisions selectively cited by the dissent have diverged from this clear test--under which determining an employee's <span class="Italic">official duty station</span> necessarily affects management's right to determine the agency's organization--we will no longer follow them. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Educ., Wash., D.C</span>., 61 FLRA 307, 309-310 (2005) (<span class="Italic">DOE</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1286-88 (1991); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3601</span>, 39 FLRA 504, 515-16 (1991); <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 83</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 411-413 (1990). Those decisions failed to recognize that, every time an employee's official duty station changes, that change necessarily affects an agency's 'administrative structure.'").</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998 and Dept. of State, Passport Serv.</span>, 66 FLRA 124, 129-30 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part), was Proposal 4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wording</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Window desks: The adjudication area will contain no fewer window seats for [employees] than was the case at the Jackson Federal Building ([a] window seat being defined as a desk with an unobstructed view, set up such that a cubicle wall is not blocking the view out of the window).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meaning of the Proposal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties explain that Proposal 4 would require the Agency to provide at least as many window seats as existed at the previous location, the Jackson Federal Building.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that it "intends to design the workspace to facilitate the ability to work in teams in proximity to immediate supervisors so that mentoring, supervisory assistance, and exchange of information among adjudicators is possible." Even assuming that this is a claim that the planned workspace design constitutes a method and means of performing work, <span class="Italic">cf. Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725 (noting that "functional grouping" policies in the work place may concern the methods and means of performing work)--and even assuming that there is a direct and integral relationship between the workspace design that the Agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the Agency's mission--the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 4 would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725 (agency failed to support claim under second prong of methods and means test). <span class="Italic">See also NTEU</span>, 41 FLRA 1283, 1289-91 (1991) (same). Accordingly, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 4 affects management's rights to determine the methods and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">See Chapter 83</span>, 64 FLRA at 725 (rejecting agency's unexplained arguments).[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Because we have found that Proposal 4 does not affect the methods and means of performing work, it is not necessary to resolve the Union's claim that Proposal 4 is a procedure or an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA at 1177.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1998,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, also approved as negotiable Proposal 6, involving the design of cubicles, eschewing an unsupported claim by the agency that the proposal interfered with its right to determine its budget and establish internal security practices, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> at 132:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wording</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cubicles: [Bargaining unit employee] cubicles will be no smaller than the cubicles in use as of August, 2010, and contain no lower amount of wall space for hanging reference materials. Glare abatement and availability of sufficient lighting will be considered in the selection of the style of work cubicles.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Meaning of the Proposal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that Proposal 6 would require the Agency to provide cubicles that are at least as large, and have at least as much wall space, as the cubicles at the old location. The parties also agree that the proposal would require the Agency to consider glare abatement and the availability of sufficient lighting.</p>
<p class="noindent">If management can demonstrate that a proposal adversely affects its methods and means of accomplishing agency work, proposals that impact layout of work or other space may become nonnegotiable. The point was made in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1920 and DOD, AAFES, Ft. Hood Exch.</span>, 47 FLRA 340, 342-44 (1993). Employees were being moved to a post exchange store from administrative offices. The union sought to expand the space allocated to the relocated employees by enlarging their designated office, reducing space otherwise available for customer service at the post exchange. Proposal 1 was nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right, under section 7106(b)(1), to determine the methods and means of performing the agency's work. In order to sustain such a claim, an agency must show: (1) that a direct relationship exists between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have construed the term "method" as referring to the way in which an agency performs its work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol, Tucson</span>, 46 FLRA at 943; <span class="Italic">Indian Hospital, Claremore</span>, 39 FLRA at 513. The term "means" refers to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A particular means used by an agency need not be indispensable to the accomplishment of the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol, Tucson</span>, 46 FLRA at 943; <span class="Italic">Indian Hospital, Claremore</span>, 39 FLRA at 513. The term "performing work" is intended to include those matters that directly and integrally relate to the agency's operations as a whole. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends as to Proposal 1 that the design and layout of the main exchange store constitutes a method or means of accomplishing the Agency's mission of providing goods and services to its customers. We find that the Agency's determination as to the design and layout of the main exchange store is a plan that is used by the Agency to accomplish its sales mission. In particular, we find that the amount of space that the Agency will allocate to displaying goods and services and the arrangement of that space for the display of those goods and services are among the measures used by the Agency to facilitate its sales mission. We find, therefore, that the design and layout of the store constitutes a "means" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find that, under the first part of the test set forth above, management's decision as to the design and layout of the main exchange store is directly and integrally related to the sales mission of that store <span id="page_1009"></span>and that, under the second part of that test, Proposal 1 directly interferes with the purpose for which the Agency adopted that plan. In particular, the Agency states that relocating the east wall of the area into which the Dishonored Check Office will be moved, as required by the proposal, would affect the layout of the store by reducing the area of the sales floor. The Union does not dispute the Agency's statement. It is well established that the parties bear the burden of creating a record upon which the Authority can make a negotiability determination. A party failing to meet its burden acts at its peril....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Agency's uncontroverted statement, we conclude that the Agency has demonstrated that the design and layout of the sales floor is directly and integrally related to the sales mission of the Agency. We also conclude, based on the Agency's uncontroverted statement, that by reducing the area of the sales floor, Proposal 1 would directly interfere with the sales-related purposes for which the Agency adopted the design and layout of the main exchange store. Consequently, because we find that, based on the record in this case, the Agency has demonstrated that Proposal 1 would directly interfere with the sales-related purposes for which the Agency adopted the design and layout of the main exchange store, we conclude that Proposal 1 directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work, and as the Union does not contend that the proposal is intended as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we find that Proposal 1 is nonnegotiable....</p>
