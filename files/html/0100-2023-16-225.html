<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-225"><span class="space">a.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span></span> Assurances Against Reprisal; Interviews Qualifying as Formal Discussions</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">IRS, Brookhaven Serv. Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 99</span>, 9 FLRA 930, 932-33 (1982), concluded that a formal interview does not occur, and there is no right to a union representative, if a management representative interviews a unit employee to gather information to present to a third-party adjudicator (in <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, to FLRA for a ULP hearing or to an arbitrator for an arbitration hearing). But the interview must be voluntary, with express assurances that there will be no reprisal by management if the employee does not agree to the interview; the interview must occur in a noncoercive setting; and the interview must not exceed its legitimate purpose:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority agrees with the position of the General Counsel that section 7114(a)(2)(A) applies only to "formal" discussions. The Statute specifically refers to "formal" discussions, and the legislative history clearly indicates Congressional intent not to extend the application of this section to personal, informal meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, the issue to be resolved is whether the discussions in question were formal or informal. If they were formal, NTEU should have been given an opportunity to be represented; if they were informal, no right attached. The Authority has found meetings to be "formal discussions" where, for example, management representatives have called meetings with employees at which attendance was mandatory and an agenda had been established by management to discuss a number of matters involving general conditions of employment or specific changes in job duties.[3] However, the Authority has recognized that not all discussions between representatives of agency management and unit employees are formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A).[4] For example, the Authority has held that certain types of "information gathering" activities are not "formal discussions" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.[5] In the instant cases, for example, attendance of the employees at the meetings was not mandatory and an agenda had not been established by management to discuss matters involving general conditions of employment or specific changes in job duties. Under the facts as stipulated, the Authority is unwilling to find the existence of a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and applicable Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_1487"></span>[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Department Of Health, Education And Welfare, Region IV, Atlanta, Georgia And Department Of Health And Human Services, Region IV</span>, 5 FLRA No. 58(1981). <span class="Italic">See Also, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia</span>, 6 FLRA No. 22 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Office Of Program Operations, Field Operations, Social Security Administration, San Francisco Region</span>, 9 FLRA NO. 9(1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Kaiserslautern American High School, Department Of Dependents Schools, Germany North Region</span>, 9 FLRA NO. 28(1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the circumstances herein, the Authority concludes that the above-described meetings did not constitute formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Rather, they were fact-gathering sessions between a representative of the Respondent and a unit employee wherein management was merely seeking information to aid in the preparation of its cases for presentation at proceedings before a third-party neutral, in the same manner as an exclusive representative may gather the facts from employees prior to such proceedings. Therefore, the Respondent was not required to give NTEU an opportunity to be represented and its failure to do so herein did not constitute an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It must be emphasized, however, that an agency may not conduct such fact-gathering sessions without limitation. Thus, while management may ascertain facts in preparing its case for third-party proceedings without the presence of the exclusive representative, the unit employees have the protected right under section 7102 of the Statute to "form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal." Accordingly, where management exercises its right to interview unit employees in preparation for third-party proceedings, but does not take necessary precautions to preserve employees' protected rights, and instead acts in a manner which "interferes with, restrains, or coerces" the employees, it violates section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. To protect employees' rights under section 7102 while management attempts to ascertain necessary facts, the Authority concludes that (1) management must inform the employee who is to be questioned of the purpose of the questioning, assure the employee that no reprisal will take place if he or she refuses, and obtain the employee's participation on a voluntary basis; (2) the questioning must occur in a context which is not coercive in nature; and (3) the questions must not exceed the scope of the legitimate purpose of the inquiry or otherwise interfere with the employee's statutory rights. In this manner, the necessary balance between the rights of management and the rights of employees and their exclusive representatives will best be preserved.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards are limited to situations involving organizational and representational rights under 5 USC 7102, as FLRA observed in a case involving interviews by management's counsel of unit employees in preparation for an MSPB hearing on a supervisor's adverse action appeal, <span class="Italic">GSA and NFFE Local 1800</span>, 50 FLRA 401, 406 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> and its progeny, the safeguards apply only where a nexus is established between an agency's interview of a bargaining unit employee in preparation for third-party proceedings and the employee's section 7102 rights. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example, F.E. Warren Air Force Base</span>, 31 FLRA at 546-49. In this case, no such nexus has been established or is otherwise apparent. In particular, there is no claim that a labor organization was involved in any way in the proceeding for which the interviews were conducted or that the proceeding otherwise concerned activity relating to any of the rights protected by section 7102. Consequently, the Respondent was not required to observe the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> would be modified, or clarified, over time. One controversy was whether the union should be notified of meetings with unit employees and given an opportunity to be present at the interviews, that is, whether the interviews constituted formal discussions. In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985), discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-228.html#sec8-228">MSPB Appeal; Interview; Deposition</a>," the court considered whether the union had the right to be notified of and attend a meeting set for management counsel to interview a unit employee scheduled to testify at an MSPB hearing on behalf of an appellant represented before the Board by the union. The court determined that the Board appeal by the unit employee, pursued through union representation, constituted a grievance within the meaning of 5 USC 7121, even though the case was being processed through a statutory rather than a contractual appellate procedure. Although the court did not give all-encompassing guidance, the court concluded that the interview of the employee as a witness to events involved in the Board appeal was sufficiently structured, sufficiently formal, to require prior notice to the union and an invitation to the union to attend the interview. The D.C. Circuit's opinion was followed by FLRA in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 29 FLRA 594 (1987), <span class="Italic">post</span>, reconfirming the right of the union to notice and an opportunity to be present at the structured management interview of a unit employee involving a scheduled labor arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA elaborated on its <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warren AFB and AFGE Local 2354</span>, 31 FLRA 541, 545-53 (1988), declaring that the assurances required do not require the use of "magic words." The focus is on whether the interview is free from coercion and the participation is voluntary. FLRA explained in <span class="Italic">Warren AFB</span>, involving management's interview of a unit employee in preparation for a ULP case, that FLRA will consider the circumstances of the interview to determine if the meeting constitutes a formal discussion about a grievance or working conditions, entitling the union to notice of and representation at the meeting, even if <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> assurances are given:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves the interrelationship between <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings, formal discussions, and examinations in connection with investigations. The Judge found that the requirements applicable to formal discussions and examinations may substitute for the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings. For the reasons discussed below, we disagree with this finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We separately will analyze the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> and the formal discussion requirements in connection with the interview of Story. Because there is no allegation in the complaint and no argument from the parties concerning the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, it is unnecessary to determine whether the interview was an "examination" within the meaning of that section. We note, however, that Story declined the Respondent's offer to have union representation during the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's conclusion that the Respondent did not violate the Statute when it failed to give the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings. We find that the essential purpose of the safeguards was fulfilled. Story knew the purpose of the interview, there was no coercion and Story refused an offer of union representation. We conclude, therefore, that Story's participation in the interview was voluntary. We reject the Judge's conclusion and the General Counsel's argument that the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings should be applied as a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards is to protect employee rights. Apart from those employee rights, a union has a right to be provided with an opportunity to attend formal discussions. We disagree with the Judge's conclusion that fulfilling the obligations concerning formal discussions can substitute for the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> safeguards. Therefore, if an interview of a unit employee constitutes a formal discussion, an agency has obligations under the Statute in addition to its obligations to assure that the interview is not coercive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the interview of Mr.&#x2003;Story was a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(A)(2)(a) of the Statute. We conclude that the Respondent fulfilled its obligations under that section when it provided notice and the opportunity to the Union to be represented at the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Brookhaven Protections</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span>, the Authority concluded that certain safeguards were necessary to protect employee rights under section 7102 of the Statute when management interviewed those employees "to ascertain necessary facts." <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> at 933. The Authority stated that (1) management must inform the employee of the purpose of the questioning, assure that there will be no reprisal for a refusal to participate, and obtain that participation voluntarily; (2) the questioning must not occur in a coercive context; and (3) the questions must not exceed the scope of the legitimate purpose of the inquiry or otherwise interfere with the employee's protected rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority did not discuss whether or not the rule was to be applied in a <span class="Italic">per se</span> manner.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Private Sector Origins and Purpose</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's requirements can be traced directly to private sector law. Since 1964, the National Labor Relations Board (the Board) has required employers seeking to interrogate employees for legitimate purposes--such as preparing a defense in an unfair labor practice trial--to communicate the purpose of the questioning, assure that no reprisal would take place, and obtain participation on a voluntary basis. <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry Co.</span>, 146 NLRB 770, 775 (1964), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds sub nom. NLRB v. Johnnie's Poultry Co.</span>, 344 F.2d 617 (8th Cir. 1965). The Board recognized that "despite the inherent danger of coercion" in an employer's interrogation of employees concerning matters involving protected rights, where there is a legitimate purpose and necessity, such as preparation for a third party proceeding, such safeguards could "minimize the coercive impact of such employer interrogation." <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span>, 146 NLRB at 774-75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Private Sector Application</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts and the Board have applied <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> safeguards many times. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Neuhoff Bros., Packers, Inc.</span>, 375 F.2d 372, 377 (5th Cir. 1967), that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[o]n the one hand, there is the legitimate right...to prepare for the employer's defense to the unfair labor practice charges. On the other hand, there is implicit in the rights enumerated in...the Act...'the right of rank-and-file employees to a congressionally provided, effective administrative process [citations omitted].' Consequently, the process of investigation through interrogation of employees must be a carefully conducted one....&#8197;There is, therefore, '...a delicate balance between the legitimate interest of the employer in <span id="page_1488"></span>preparing its case for trial, and the interest of the employee in being free from unwarranted interrogation...,' for '...any interrogation by the employer relating to union matters presents an ever present danger of coercing employees in violation of their...rights [citations omitted].'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit noted that the Board in <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> had attempted to strike a balance "between the employer's need to prepare adequately for pending unfair labor practice cases and the inherently coercive nature...of employer interrogation of employees during a labor dispute." <span class="Italic">UAW v. NLRB</span>, 392 F.2d 801, 809 (D.C. Cir. 1967), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. Preston Products Co. v. NLRB</span>, 392 U.S. 906 (1968). The court traced the concept that such a balance must be struck to protect against interrogation which is "inherently coercive" to <span class="Italic">Joy Silk Mills v. NLRB</span>, 185 F.2d 732, 743-44 (D.C. Cir. 1950), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 341 U.S. 914 (1951).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board has held that compliance with the <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> safeguards does not require the use of "magic words[.]" <span class="Italic">Superior Container</span>, 276 NLRB 521, 522 (1985). The Board has also held, however, that the safeguards are "applicable irrespective of the employer's intent to coerce, the extent of the questioning or number of employees so interrogated, or the remoteness of the interrogation to the alleged unlawful conduct." <span class="Italic">Kyle &#x0026; Stephen, Inc.</span>, 259 NLRB 731, 733 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The courts are divided on whether the <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> safeguards should be applied as a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 1 <span class="Italic">The Developing Labor Law</span> 125-27 (C. Morris 2d ed. 1983) and 1 <span class="Italic">The Developing Labor Law</span> 25 (C. Morris 2d ed., 2d supp. 1987). In <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; R Transport</span>, 237 NLRB 1084 (1978), for example, the Board adopted the Administrative Law Judge's conclusion that the employer had committed an unfair labor practice by failing to provide an employee with the <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> safeguards even though the "omissions of assurances...were inadvertent and free from unlawful motivation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1089. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to enforce that part of the Board's order. <span class="Italic">A &#x0026; R Transport, Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 601 F.2d 311 (7th Cir. 1979). The court noted that the Board had found that failure to adhere strictly to <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> safeguards "constitutes a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of &#x00A7; 8(a)(1) [of the NLRA]<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 313. The court held as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The interrogation standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry</span> are relevant in determining whether an interview was coercive and thus violative of &#x00A7; 8(a)(1). We join with other circuits, however, in declining to approve a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule and instead will look to the totality of the circumstances, including the purpose of the interview, the entire statement made to the employee, and the scope of the questioning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Retired Persons Pharmacy v. NLRB</span>, 519 F.2d 486, 492 (2d Cir. 1975) ("The rule in this Circuit is that employer interrogation is unlawful if it is coercive in light of all of the surrounding circumstances.")<span class="Italic">. Compare Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Carpet Yarn Division v. NLRB</span>, 691 F.2d 1133, 1141 (4th Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 460 U.S. 1083 (1983), where the court found that the Board's application of a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule did not constitute an abuse of discretion but noted that "[a]rguably, the statute would be better served by raising a rebuttable presumption of coerciveness in such cases[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of Brookhaven to This Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry/Brookhaven</span> protections is to protect employees from coercive questioning concerning matters involving employees' protected rights. We find that the purpose of the warnings was fulfilled in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Story was told of the purpose of the interview.&#x2003;At the beginning he declined the offer to have a Union representative present. The Judge found on the basis of credibility determinations that "no threat or suggestion was made that there might be repercussions if Mr. Story refused to cooperate[.]" The General Counsel requests the Authority to reverse the Judge's credibility determinations. As the General Counsel notes, however, the Authority will not reverse a Judge's credibility findings unless a clear preponderance of all the relevant evidence demonstrates that the Judge's findings were incorrect. <span class="Italic">See United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, New York</span>, 27 FLRA 874, 878 n.4 (1987), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, No. 87-4153 (2d Cir. November 17, 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have carefully reviewed the record in this case and determine that there is no basis on which to reverse the Judge's findings. Further, there is nothing in the record to show that the interview took place in a coercive context, or that the Respondent questioned Mr. Story on any matters other than those directly involved in the unfair labor practice hearing. Therefore, we agree with the Judge's conclusion that "there was no interference with Mr. Story's protected rights[;] Respondent did not make any threat and did not coercively question Mr. Story." We conclude that despite the Respondent's failure to expressly assure Story that there would be no reprisals, he was free from coercion and his participation was voluntary. The purpose of the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings was fulfilled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the General Counsel's request that we find any failure to provide the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings to be a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the Statute. We find that the purposes of the Statute are better served by determining whether the circumstances in which interviews occur are coercive instead of simply determining whether the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> assurances were stated. We note, however, that agencies may choose to provide the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings in order to assure that employee participation is voluntary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting Was a Formal Discussion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings is to assure that employees are not subject to coercive questioning concerning the exercise of the employees' protected rights under the Statute. The right to be free of coercion is an employee right. Apart from this employee right, a union has the right under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to be given the opportunity to be represented at formal discussions. A formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) exists if there is (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives; (4) concerning any grievance or personnel policies or other general condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the rights addressed by the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> decision and the rights which accompany a formal discussion are different, we will examine the record to determine if the questioning of Story constituted a formal discussion and if so, whether the Respondent fulfilled its obligations under section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting was a "Discussion"</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, California</span>, 29 FLRA 594 (1987) ("<span class="Italic">McClellan</span>"), we found that an interview of a unit employee who was to be a Union witness in an arbitration proceeding was a formal discussion. We there noted that we have found the term "discussion" to be synonymous with "meeting." <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Texas Adjutant General's Department, 149th TAC Fighter Group (ANG) (TAC), Kelly Air Force Base</span>, 15 FLRA 529 (1984). A meeting took place here in which a unit employee answered questions from a management representative. We find that the meeting was a "discussion" within the meaning of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting was "Formal"</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The meeting took place in a private room in the civilian personnel office, in the presence of an Air Force attorney, the Respondent's chief of employee and labor relations, and the latter's assistant. The Union, and Story individually, were informed of the purpose of the meeting. These indicia of formality lead us to conclude that the meeting was formal. <span class="Italic">See McClellan</span>, 29 FLRA at 603.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting concerned a Grievance or Personnel Policy or Practice or other General Condition of Employment</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting Concerned a "Grievance"</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recently reviewed the scope of the term "grievance" as it applies to section 7114(a)(2)(A). We stated that a "grievance" can encompass a statutory appeal. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Correctional Institution (Ray Brook, New York</span>), 29 FLRA 584 (1987) ("<span class="Italic">FCI (Ray Brook</span>)"), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, No. 87-1723 (D.C. Cir. Nov. 27, 1987). The term grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) is not limited to a complaint under a grievance procedure, but would also include complaints under other third party procedures established by statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision in <span class="Italic">FCI</span> (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>) considered the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985). We noted that the court concluded that "grievance" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) should be interpreted in light of the broad definition of the term in section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute. Section 7103(a)(9) defines "grievance" as "any complaint":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The interview of Story was in preparation for an unfair labor practice hearing concerning an allegation that the Respondent had interfered with unit employees' protected rights involving picketing. The interview concerned a complaint by an employee or labor organization, which was prosecuted by the General Counsel, concerning a claimed violation of the Statute which affected conditions of employment. All of the elements of the definition in section 7103(a)(9) of the term "grievance" are met. The meeting in this case concerned a "grievance" within the scope of the term as it appears in section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_1489"></span>(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Meeting Concerned a Personnel Policy or Practice or Other General Condition of Employment</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The subject matter of the January 8 meeting was alleged management interference with employee picketing.&#x2003;Employee picketing involves protected employee rights under the Statute. These rights concern conditions of employment. Therefore, the meeting was in preparation for unfair labor practice proceedings which concerned a personnel policy or practice or other condition of employment of general concern.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Authority does not Adopt the Judge's Analytical Approach</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Judge's conclusion that agency management may treat interviews as one kind of meeting or another at its option. We recently reaffirmed that section 7114(a)(2)(A) and 7114(a)(2)(B) establish separate rights to representation, and that the particular facts of each case will determine which provisions of the Statute are pertinent. <span class="Italic">McClellan</span>, 29 FLRA at 600. Whether section 7114(a)(2)(A) or (B) applies is determined by the facts of each case. <span class="Italic">See, for example, id</span>. at 598-600. If an interview is a formal discussion, an agency must fulfill its statutory obligations concerning formal discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of our conclusions that (1) the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings was fulfilled, and (2) the meeting was a formal discussion concerning which the Respondent met its obligations under section 7114(a)(2)(A), we do not address the Judge's alternative finding that <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> does not apply because Story was acting as Respondent's agent at the time of the acts which were the subject of the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Summary</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of the <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings was fulfilled at the interview which the Respondent held with unit employee Story for the purpose of preparing for an unfair labor practice hearing. Further, the interview was a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, and the Respondent fulfilled its obligations concerning formal discussions. Therefore, we find that the Respondent did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by conducting the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent">Noted in the <span class="Italic">Warren AFB </span>case was the NLRB decision in <span class="Italic">Johnnie's Poultry Co.</span>, 146 NLRB 770, 775 (1964), briefly excerpted (footnotes omitted):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On December 6, 1962, the Union filed charges alleging violations of Section 8(a) (3) and on December 12, 1962, the Union amended its charges by adding allegations of Section 8 (a) (1) and (5) violations. On December 27, 1962, Respondent's attorneys went to the plant and interviewed each of the approximately 40 employees present who had signed an authorization card submitted to the Respondent by the Union. At the outset of each interview the attorney explained his position and purpose--that of investigating a charge which the Union had filed against the Company--and assured the employee that the law protected the employee's rights and that those rights would be respected. Each employee was then asked to identify his signature on the photostat of his union authorization card and to describe the circumstances under which he signed the card, including where, for whom, and whether the amount of initiation fees and dues was discussed and if he understood that they were waived. Some were also asked whether they understood the meaning of the, cards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the interviews the attorneys learned that employees had signed an additional document for the Union, one specifically authorizing the Union to use the cards to gain recognition. Thereafter, both attorneys also asked if the employee had signed another paper for the Union, whether it was signed at a union meeting, and who was present when it was signed. In this connection Mary Shrum was asked where union meetings were held.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As indicated above, one of Respondent's asserted reasons for conducting the employee interviews was to ascertain facts for the preparation of its defense in the event a complaint issued on the charges which the Board was then investigating. In this connection employees interviewed were also asked by the attorneys if any Company supervisory personnel had discussed the Union with them. In answering this question, Duvall told of Superintendent Cathy's questions and comments with respect to the wearing of union campaign buttons, a matter related to the Cook incident referred to above. Duvall was then asked whether he had given the Board agent a statement along these lines and he replied that he had, whereupon he was requested to repeat his statement. Duvall refused. In response to the same question concerning the supervisors' activities, Cook related his conversation with Schnurbusch on the wearing of union buttons. He was then asked if he had given a statement to the Board and if he would also give Respondent a statement. Cook complied. At this time Cook had given the Board agent an oral statement but had not yet executed a pretrial affidavit. Haynes also related the circumstances under which he received the loan from Bishop. When asked whether he had spoken to anyone from the Board with respect thereto he replied that he had not, although he had. Respondent's attorneys admitted that they may have asked the same questions of other employees whom they interviewed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the inherent danger of coercion therein, the Board and courts have held that where an employer has a legitimate cause to inquire, he may exercise the privilege of interrogating employees on matters involving their Section 7 rights without incurring Section 8(a)(1) liability. The purposes which the Board and courts have held legitimate are of two types: the verification of a union's claimed majority status to determine whether recognition should be extended, involved in the preceding discussion, and the investigation of facts concerning issues raised in a complaint where such interrogation is necessary in preparing the employer's defense for trial of the case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In allowing an employer the privilege of ascertaining the necessary facts from employees in these given circumstances, the Board and courts have established specific safeguards designed to minimize the coercive impact of such employer interrogation. Thus, the employer must communicate to the employee the purpose of the questioning, assure him that no reprisal will take place, and obtain his participation on a voluntary basis; the questioning must occur in a context free from employer hostility to union organization and must not be itself coercive in nature; and the questions must not exceed the necessities of the legitimate purpose by prying into other union matters, eliciting information concerning an employee's subjective state of mind, or otherwise interfering with the statutory rights of employees. When an employer transgresses the boundaries of these safeguards, he loses the benefits of the privilege.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In defining the area of permissible inquiry, the Board has generally found coercive, and outside the ambit of privilege, interrogation concerning statements or affidavits given to a Board agent. For such questions have a pronounced inhibitory effect upon the exercise by employees of their Section 7 rights, which includes protection in seeking vindication of those rights free from interference, restraint, and coercion by their employer. Moreover, interrogation concerning employee activities directed toward enforcement of Section 7 rights also interferes with the Board's processes in carrying out the statutory mandate to protect such rights. We note, in this connection, that under the safeguards attending a hearing on unfair labor practices, counsel for Respondent parties are entitled to the availability, upon request, of the affidavits of, General Counsel witnesses for use in cross-examining those witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent">In general terms, the issue is whether the interviews are conducted under coercive circumstances. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 36 FLRA 748 (1990) (interview by criminal investigator). <span class="Italic">Brookhaven</span> warnings help to assure freedom from coercion; without the warnings, the conditions of the meeting will be examined to ascertain whether the interview was coercive. In the context of interviews of unit members by management for an MSPB hearing, a court applied <span class="Italic">Brookhaven.</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach v. FLRA</span>, 16 F.3d 1526, 1534-36 (9th Cir. 1994) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-228.html#sec8-228">MSPB Appeal; Interview; Deposition</a>").</p>
