<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8337(b) (CSRS) provides the time limit for a disability retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 8453, sets the time for FERS disability retirement applications:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim may be allowed under this subchapter only if application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who, at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulation for FERS applications is 5 CFR 844.201 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">General requirements</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, an application for disability retirement is timely only if it is filed with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from <span id="Page_4146"></span>service, or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM, an employing agency or former employing agency by personal delivery is considered filed on the date on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency receives it. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the application is presumed to have been mailed 5 days before its receipt, excluding days on which OPM, the employing agency or former employing agency, as appropriate, is closed for business. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the application is given to the overnight delivery service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An application for disability retirement that is filed with OPM or the applicant's former employing agency within 1 year after the employee's separation, and that is incompletely executed or submitted in a letter or other form not prescribed by OPM, is deemed timely filed. OPM will not adjudicate the application or make payment until the application is filed on a form prescribed by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;OPM may waive the 1-year time limit if the employee or Member is mentally incompetent on the date of separation or within 1 year thereafter, in which case the individual or his or her representative must file the application with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year after the date the individual regains competency or a court appoints a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1) Before payment of a disability annuity under this part can be authorized, the applicant must provide OPM with:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;Satisfactory evidence that the applicant has filed an application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;An official statement from the Social Security Administration that the individual is not insured for disability insurance benefits as defined in section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A disability retirement application under this part will be dismissed when OPM is notified by the Social Security Administration that the application referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has been withdrawn. All rights to an annuity under this part terminate upon withdrawal of an application for social security disability benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An agency may consider the existence of a pending disability retirement application when deciding whether and when to take other personnel actions. An employee's filing for disability retirement does not require the agency to delay any appropriate personnel action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carlson v. OPM</span>, 556 Fed. Appx. 954, 956 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP), summarized the one-year filing requirement for a CSRS disability retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An application for disability retirement ordinarily must be filed with OPM "before [an] employee...is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). That time limitation may be waived if, "at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter," the applicant was "mentally incompetent," and "the application is filed with [OPM] within 1 year from the date of restoration of...competency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "[M]ental incompetence is an inability to handle one's personal affairs because of either physical or mental disease or injury." <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007). This court has also recognized that waiver of the time limit established in &#x00A7; 8337(b) "may lie against the agency when procedural error, in contravention of the agency's established duties, results in derogation of the employee's rights." <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 413 F.3d 1339, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (remanding to determine whether petitioner received the requisite notice that his employment had been formally terminated and advising him of his options).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The FERS filing requirement is substantially the same as CSRS, <span class="Italic">Deerinwater v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 183, 185-87 (1995) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Deerinwater v. OPM,</span> 78 F.3d 570 (1996)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An application for disability retirement under FERS must be filed with OPM within 1 year of the employee's separation from Federal service, except in cases of mental incompetence not applicable here. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. The statute provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A claim may be allowed under this subchapter only if application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The statute further provides that the word "Office" means OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(24). In addition, OPM's FERS regulations provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An application for disability retirement must be filed, on a form prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), with the employing agency before the employee or Member separates from service or with OPM within 1 year thereafter. A separated employee who submits an application to the former employing agency, rather than with OPM, will meet the filing deadline only if OPM receives the application from the agency within 1 year after the separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the statute and OPM's regulation are unambiguous on their face. Moreover, the Board has consistently held in analogous cases brought under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), that an employee's filing of a disability retirement application with her former employing agency does not constitute constructive filing with OPM. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hawes v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 330, 333 (1991);<span class="Italic"> Stevenson-Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 527-529-30 (1991). Because the appellant's application for disability retirement was not received by OPM within 1 year after her separation from Federal service, the administrative judge correctly found that her application was untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his Dissenting Opinion, the Chairman relies to some degree on the reasoning employed by Member (then Vice chairman) Amador in his Dissenting Opinion in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips,</span> although not on the authorities cited therein. To the extent that the Chairman relies on the Dissenting Opinion in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips,</span> such reliance is not persuasive under the facts and circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) supplement and FPM letter on which the <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips</span> dissent relied do not apply to FERS cases. Furthermore, the OPM instructions applicable to FERS cases do not include statements comparable to those in the FPM material cited in that dissent. They do not indicate, for example, that applicants are not to send anything directly to OPM unless specifically instructed to do so. In addition, they specifically provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee [such as the appellant in this case] who initiates an application for retirement after having been separated from the Federal service for a period of 31 days or more <span class="Italic">must</span> send his or her application and all supporting documentation <span class="Italic">directly to OPM....</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Supp. 830-1, &#x00A7; 60B2.1-1D(1) (Jan. 20, 1991) (emphasis added). They also provide that, "(w)hen an application is filed directly with OPM, [OPM] will request any necessary information from the agency that has not already been submitted."<span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 6OB2.1-1D(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, this appeal differs from the case at issue in <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips</span> in that the instructions applicable to the present appeal clearly identify a point in time after which applications must be filed with OPM. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 60B2.1-1D(1); <span class="Italic">see Stevenson-Phillips,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. at 533) (Vice Chairman Amador, dissenting). In fact, the appellant in this appeal filed her application after that point, i.e., more than 31 days after she was separated from the Federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, and perhaps more important, the regulations applicable to this FERS case clearly provide, as we noted above, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A separated employee who submits an application to the former employing agency, rather than with OPM, will meet the filing deadline only if OPM receives the application from the agency within 1 year after the separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(1). This provision, which has been in effect since before the appellant in this case was separated, is inconsistent with a finding that OPM has authorized employing agencies to accept retirement applications from applicants such as this appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Dissenting Opinion suggests that there is no reason for OPM to provide filing instructions to still-employed applicants that are different from those it provides to applicants who have been separated from the Federal service. We do not agree. There is a logical basis for instructing or encouraging applicants who are still employed, or who have been separated for no more than a month, to file their applications through their employing agencies. The employing agencies of those applicants, unlike the employing agencies of others, generally have in their possession the information they need to complete the retirement-related documents that OPM needs to process the applications. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 293.307(a) (an agency generally is required to retain the official personnel folder (OPF) of a separated employee for 30 working days after her separation, and it generally is required to forward that OPF after that time to the National Personnel Records Center of the General Services Administration). In addition, an employing agency can reasonably be expected to forward the application of a still-employed or very recently separated applicant before the filing period ends, since that period lasts at least 11 months after the agency receives the application. If the employee has been separated for some time, however, timely forwarding becomes more uncertain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although the Dissenting Opinion would overrule <span class="Italic">Stevenson-Phillips</span> and its progeny, it is inappropriate to do so on the basis of FERS authorities that are inapplicable to CSRS cases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, according to<span class="Italic"> Chapman v. OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 423, 427-28 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11, 2009 <span id="Page_4147"></span>MSPB 12 (2009), the rules for filing a disability annuity application under CSRS and FERS are "broadly similar":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the administrative judge's error, the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements for applying for and establishing entitlement to a disability retirement under CSRS and FERS are "broadly similar." <span class="Italic">Royster v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 655, 658, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 91 F.3d 170 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 519 U.S. 984 (1996). An application for disability retirement under CSRS must be filed with an employee's employing agency before the employee separates from service or with the former employing agency or with OPM within one year after the employee's separation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b); <span class="Italic">Youngblood v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 7 (2008); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(5); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 (an employee covered under FERS must file his application for disability retirement prior to his separation or within one year thereafter); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.201(a)(1) (same). Under both CSRS and FERS, the one-year time limit for filing a disability retirement application following an employee's separation from service may be waived if the employee is mentally incompetent at the date of separation or within one year thereafter and if the application is filed with OPM within one year from the date the employee is restored to competency or is appointed a fiduciary, whichever is earlier. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8337(b), 8453; <span class="Italic">Youngblood,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 278, &#x00B6; 7; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1204(d), 844.201(a)(4). It is the employee's burden to prove by preponderant evidence that he was mentally incompetent during the relevant filing period. <span class="Italic">Pilcher v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 317, &#x00B6; 6, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 118 F. App'x 499 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant asserted below that he was not informed at the time of his separation of any deadline for filing for a disability retirement. However, because the record shows that the appellant was not removed from his position, but, instead, resigned, his former employing agency had no duty to inform him of his right to seek a disability retirement or of the filing deadlines for applying for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Elendu v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 6 n.1 (2008) (where the employee, who was covered under FERS, voluntarily resigned from service, the agency was under no obligation to inform him of his disability retirement eligibility and of the time limit for filing an application); <span class="Italic">but cf. Johnston v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 413 F.3d 1339, 1342 (if the employee was removed from service for medical reasons and his former employing agency failed to inform him in writing of his possible eligibility for disability retirement, the employee's noncompliance with the timing provisions for applying for a CSRS disability retirement may be excused), <span class="Italic">revised on recons.,</span> 430 F.3d 1376, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An annuity only becomes payable after the annuitant files an application. <span class="Italic">Oshiver v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 191, 195-96 (1988) (recognizing contrary suggestion in <span class="Italic">Oshiver v. United States</span>, 638 F. Supp. 172, 175 (E.D. Pa. 1985). The Board has construed correspondence received by OPM from the appellant as a disability annuity application when the correspondence mentioned facts concerning his disability and stated that the appellant was asking for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kleinknecht v. OPM,</span> 96 MSPR 198, 202 &#x00B6; 7 (2004) (citing "<span class="Italic">Enzian v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 135, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (1999) (under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1204(b), OPM should have treated correspondence from the appellant as 'informal claims for the purpose of the statutory timeliness requirement [at 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b),] even though the correspondence may not have been properly executed or on the appropriate forms, given the appellant's' obvious intent...to claim a disability benefit").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule on the timing of disability annuity applications applies to attempts to convert from discontinued service annuity to disability annuity, <span class="Italic">In re Shinko</span>, 1 MSPR 339, 340 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b) provides that a claim for disability retirement must be filed before the employee is separated from service or within one year thereafter. Since appellant was separated on November 30, 1974, the request for change to disability retirement on January 10, 1978, was untimely. Moreover, the provisions of the law authorize no administrative discretion in the application of the statutory time limit defined therein, except in the case of the mental incompetence of the applicant, but no such allegation of lack of competence has been raised in this case. <span class="Italic">See Marcee v. United States,</span> 455 F.2d 525, 526 (Ct. Cl. 1972). Because of the finding of untimeliness, no examination of the merits has been undertaken.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule on timing of a disability application applies to new conditions supporting an application. "To be entitled to a disability retirement annuity, an applicant must show that he is currently an employee or has been separated from service for one year or less." <span class="Italic">Zabalveitia v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 48, 51 (1991) (citing 5 USC 8337(a), (b)). Once separated on disability retirement, the employee becomes an annuitant. Upon recovery, any application for disability retirement status based on a new condition must be filed within one year from the original separation from employment, not from a point in time when the appellant was an annuitant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The date of the employee's separation from employment, and therefore the date initiating the period for filing a disability retirement application may be influenced by external events, including litigation or settlements of personnel actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moran v. OPM</span>, 72 MSPR 138, 141 (1996) ("For example, when an employee resigned pursuant to a settlement agreement, the date of her resignation was controlling in determining whether she was disabled, as this was her last date of Federal service, although she had not actually worked for the agency for several years. <span class="Italic">See Davenport v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 370 (1993).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Attempts to set separation dates through settlement agreements, leading to OPM challenges to the timeliness of disability retirement applications, led to several Board decisions.
