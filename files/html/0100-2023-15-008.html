<p class="Body-Text">Many decisions attempt to establish factors to be considered when an agency seeks to remove an employee for lengthy absence that includes approved leave.<span class="Italic"> Harden v. VA</span>, DA-0752-15-0597-I-1 (NP 1/6/2017), restates the basic rule that the agency proves its charge of excessive absence when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...the appellant was absent due to illness such that the agency's approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial; the absences continued beyond a reasonable time; the agency warned her that an adverse action could be taken unless she could become available for duty on a regular full-time or part-time basis; and the position needed to be filled on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 31 (2014) (identifying the elements of proof for a charge of excessive absences).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Relied on in <span class="Italic">Harden</span> was <span class="Italic">Fox v. Dept. of Army</span>, 120 MSPR 529, 549 &#x00B6; 31, 2014 MSPB 6 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We construe the agency's second charge, i.e., inability to work a regular schedule, as a charge of excessive absences. To prove a charge of excessive absences, an agency must establish that: (1) the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.<span class="Italic"> Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Cited in<span class="Italic"> Fox</span> was<span class="Italic"> Cook v. Dept. of Army</span>, 18 MSPR 610, 611-12 (1984), <span class="Italic">post</span>, a decision relying on the now-defunct Federal Personnel Manual:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) provides an exception to the general rule that an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. The following three criteria must be met to satisfy the exception:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1)&#x2003;The record showed that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) also states the exception is only applicable under unusual circumstances, i.e., when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. It does not apply to repeated absences to attend to personal affairs, as these situations would presumably be under the control of the employee and thus the agency could have legitimate reasons for denial of leave.</p>

Department of Army,</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board ('board') held that an agency could not take an adverse action against an employee based on the excessive use of leave unless the agency could show, among other things, that the absent employee's position 'needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, fulltime or part-time basis.' 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 612 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Combs <span id="Page_2430"></span>v.

<p class="Body-Text">Between the 1984 <span class="Italic">Cook</span> decision and the most recent summary of the rules in the 2017 <span class="Italic">Harden</span> case, many decisions explain and apply to many factual situations the bases for removal of an employee for excessive absence that is approved, or for absence that is in part approved and not approved, including cases involving absences justified under the FMLA statutory grant of leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCauley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There appears to be some inconsistency in Board precedent regarding what leave can be used to support an adverse action based on excessive leave use. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Curtis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2009) (holding that an agency cannot discipline an individual for his use of approved sick leave but can discipline an employee for his use of unscheduled LWOP); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 564, 570 (1997) (holding that an agency can bring an action against an employee for excessive absence even if the absence is excused on grounds of poor health); <span class="Italic">Webb v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 536, 543 (1982) (holding that an adverse action taken by an agency against an employee based on periods of approved leave does not promote the efficiency of the service). Because the efficiency of the service may suffer in the absence of an employee's services, regardless of the type of leave used, we hold that whether the leave is sick leave, annual leave, LWOP, or AWOL will not be dispositive to a charge of excessive absences. To the extent that the Board has held or implied otherwise in cases such as <span class="Italic">Curtis</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 626, <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 71 (2007), <span class="Italic">Scorcia v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 588 (1998), <span class="Italic">Holderness v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 428 (1982), and <span class="Italic">Webb</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 536, those cases are expressly overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's case, the agency included absences under the FMLA in its specification for the charge of excessive absences. By statute, any employee who takes FMLA leave "for the intended purpose of the leave shall be entitled, upon return from such leave--(1) to be restored by the employing agency to the position held by the employee when the leave commenced; or (2) to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6384(a). Because Congress's clear intent when enacting FMLA was to provide job security for individuals who needed to be temporarily absent due to a serious medical condition (whether their own or that of a family member addressed by the FMLA legislation) and the law unambiguously promises this job security, use of FMLA in any calculation to remove an employee is inappropriate.[2] Therefore, it is improper to consider FMLA absences as a part of the equation when evaluating if an employee has taken excessive leave. In contrast, the appellant's use of other LWOP, annual leave, or sick leave may be used to demonstrate that her absences were excessive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;When enacting FMLA, Congress found that there was a "lack of employment policies to accommodate working parents [that could] force individuals to choose between job security and parenting" and there was "inadequate job security for employees who have serious health conditions that prevent them from working for temporary periods." H.R. Rep. No. 103-8(I) at 1 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The excessive absences charge cannot be sustained because the deciding official failed to consider all elements of that charge</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant notes in her petition for review, the Board has held that in order to prove a charge of excessive absences, the agency must show, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job." <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984). In this case, the deciding official testified that because "there were big chunks of leave without pay that were granted to" the appellant while the supervisor "was waiting for medical documentation," the deciding official was unable to "know" whether the appellant was able to report for work. Therefore, based on the record evidence, we must conclude that the agency failed to meet its burden of proof with regard to this element of the charge of excessive absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The penalty of removal is reasonable given the nature and extent of the sustained AWOL charge.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the excessive absences charge discussed above, the appellant was charged with having been AWOL for 22 consecutive workdays in March and April 2009, and was previously reprimanded for AWOL in November 2008. The Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). Where, as here, not all of the charges are sustained, the Board will consider carefully whether the sustained charges merit the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 308. In such a case, the Board may mitigate the agency's penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty so long as the agency has not indicated in either its final decision or in proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the deciding official considered the appellant's more than 20 years with the agency and her medical condition, but indicated that in light of the appellant's past discipline, he would have removed the appellant for the AWOL charge alone. AWOL is a serious offense and the Board has held that removal is a reasonable penalty for a sustained charge of AWOL for several weeks, particularly where the appellant has prior discipline for the same offense. <span class="Italic">See Thom v. Department of the Army,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 7 (2010); <span class="Italic">Dias v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 53, &#x00B6; 16 (2006); <span class="Italic">Foreman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 328, &#x00B6; 17 (2001). Because the penalty of removal for more than 20 consecutive workdays of AWOL does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness, the agency's removal of the appellant is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 629-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-34, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015), AWOL should not be included in the excessive approved leave charge, but it may be separately charged:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the AWOL charge, is undisputed that the appellant was absent on all the dates and for all the hours for which she was charged AWOL and that the agency did not authorize those absences. However, where an employee has requested leave to cover her absences, an AWOL charge will be sustained only if the agency establishes that her requests were properly denied. <span class="Italic">Ferguson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 143, 144 (1990).[5] If the employee requested LWOP for the periods when she was placed in an AWOL status, the Board will examine the record as a whole to determine if the denial of LWOP was reasonable under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Joyner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 154, 159 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;To prove an AWOL charge, an agency must establish "that the employee was absent, and that his absence was not authorized <span class="Italic">or</span> that his request for leave was properly denied." <span class="Italic">Little v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 6 (2009) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see Wesley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 (2003) (same). Read literally, this phrasing would suggest that an agency could prove an AWOL charge merely by showing that it did not authorize the employee's absences, even if the employee made a request for leave that was <span class="Italic">not</span> properly denied. This is not the case. <span class="Italic">See Ferguson</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 144. More precisely, to prove an AWOL charge, an agency must demonstrate that the employee was absent without authorization and, if the employee requested leave, that the request was properly denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, when an employee who is incapacitated for duty has exhausted all of her leave, an agency may properly deny her LWOP request where there is no foreseeable end in sight to her absences and where those absences are a burden on the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, however, the appellant contends that she was constructively suspended during the period she was charged with AWOL. If so, this would entail not only that she had no meaningful choice concerning those absences, but also that her lack of choice was the result of the agency's wrongful actions. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8. We find that it would be inherently unreasonable for an agency to deny LWOP to cover absences for which the agency was culpable. Accordingly, should the administrative judge determine on remand that the appellant was constructively suspended during the period for which she was charged AWOL, the charge must be reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the charge of excessive absences. In the specification under that charge, the agency cited the entire period of the appellant's absences from August 18, 2008, through August 14, 2009. These absences include 1,192 hours of approved leave, of which 480 were covered by the FMLA, as well as the 800 AWOL hours with which she was separately charged. As a general rule, an agency may not take an adverse action based on an employee's use of approved leave. <span class="Italic">Bair v. Department <span id="Page_2431"></span>of Defense</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 374, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). However, an exception may exist where the following criteria are met: (1) the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial because she could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless she became available for duty on a regular full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984). This exception is applicable only under unusual circumstances, i.e., where the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, we have held that an employee may not be disciplined for use of leave covered by the FMLA. <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 11 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of the 1,192 hours of approved leave cited in the proposal notice, 480 hours were covered by the FMLA, and therefore cannot support the charge. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. As for the remainder, we find that the agency failed to establish element (2) of the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception. The record reflects that D.B. notified the appellant on several occasions that failure to come to work when not in an approved leave status would result in her placement in an AWOL status, which in turn could lead to an adverse action. Yet, it was not until April 3, 2009, that D.B. warned the appellant that she could be removed not only for AWOL, but also for "excessive absenteeism," which might be understood to include approved leave. That warning came too late, though, for by then the agency had ceased to approve additional leave, and the appellant was in an AWOL status in any event. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant did not receive the notice required for the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception to apply. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 32 (2014). Thus, the excessive absences charge cannot be sustained as to any of her approved absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the 800 hours of AWOL, it has been suggested in dicta that periods of AWOL may be included in a charge of excessive absences. <span class="Italic">McCauley,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 10.[6] However, while it is true that AWOL is a type of absence, the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> holding was based on provisions of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) specifically concerned with excessive use of <span class="Italic">approved</span> leave.<span class="Italic"> See Cook,</span> 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12. Although the FPM was abolished in 1993, the Cook holding has survived for decades since, and we see no grounds for revising it now. Accordingly, to the extent that periods of AWOL are included within a charge of excessive absences, we will not consider those periods under the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> standard, but instead will consider them as an AWOL charge. Here, the 800 AWOL hours cited in the excessive absences charge, when construed as a charge of AWOL, are entirely duplicative of the first charge, and we therefore give them no further consideration. In sum, the second charge is not sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The excessive absences charge in <span class="Italic">McCauley</span> did not include the AWOL periods with which the appellant in that case was separately charged. <span class="Italic">McCauley</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the agency's final charge, unavailability for duty with no foreseeable end, the administrative judge again stated the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> elements. This is understandable, as the term "unavailability for duty" may suggest a charge of excessive absences, to which the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> standard would apply. <span class="Italic">See Edwards v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 14 (2008). However, after reviewing the proposal notice and decision letter, we conclude that the third charge was not based on the appellant's past absences, but rather her continuing inability to return to work. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may remove an employee if she is unable, because of a medical condition, to perform the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. In finding removal warranted based on an employee's inability to work due to incapacitation, the Board has relied on the absence of any foreseeable end to the unavailability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. Here, it is undisputed that the appellant was medically unable to return to the workplace. Furthermore, considering the appellant's repeated failure to return to work on the dates projected by Dr. B.M., and Dr. J.H.'s doubt that she would ever return to work in the same capacity, we find that the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that there was no foreseeable end to the appellant's medical inability to perform her duties. The third charge therefore is sustained.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The result is that AWOL supports discipline, and that has always been so, but under <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, AWOL will not be considered as part of the time charged to an employee removed for excessive use of approved leave. As to an agency's reliance on approved leave, other than FMLA leave, to support removal, <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COOK_DAVID_W_NY07528210056_OPINION_AND_ORDER_238964.pdf">18 MSPR 610</a>, 611-12 (1984), described this exception to the rule that approved absence may not support adverse action. Under <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, the exceptions do not apply to repeated absences of an employee who must attend to personal affairs. The employee's leave status is then under agency control and the agency would have had legitimate reasons to deny the leave taken by the employee. The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, involving an employee who was suspended (the agency deciding official reduced the proposed removal to the suspension) for excessive absenteeism and nonavailability for work resulting from use of 398 hours of annual leave, 409 hours of sick leave, and about 680 hours of LWOP over three years:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a petition for review, contending that the presiding official erred in failing to address Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c). The agency contends that the suspension should be sustained pursuant to this provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) provides an exception to the general rule that an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave. The following three criteria must be met to satisfy the exception:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The record showed that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) also states the exception is only applicable under unusual circumstances, i.e., when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury. It does not apply to repeated absences to attend to personal affairs, as these situations would presumably be under the control of the employee and thus the agency could have legitimate reasons for denial of leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that agencies have authority to deny leave for unjustified absences. <span class="Italic">See Lawson v. Government Printing Office</span>, 12 MSPB 157 (1981). The presiding official found that had the agency been more businesslike it would have denied appellant's leave and thus would have placed him on notice that his attendance was less than acceptable. It did not, however, do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official also found that when an agency approves leave, it releases the employee from the obligation to report, and, therefore, such absence is not considered to be a breach of the employer-employee relationship, and thus an adverse action based on a record of approved leave would not promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that FPM Chapter 752, Subchapter 3, paragraph 3-2b(4)(c) should be applied only in unusual cases, and is not warranted in this case. Therefore, we find no error in the presiding official's findings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scott v. DHHS,</span> DC-0752-10-0198-I-1 (NP 9/8/2011), confirmed that an employee may be removed under <span class="Italic">Cook</span> for a charge of failure to maintain a regular work schedule, based on LWOP under OWCP, although an agency cannot include FMLA leave in its decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a GS-0303-06 Admissions Assistant employed by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. The agency removed the appellant on a single charge of "Failure to Maintain a Regular Work Schedule." <span id="Page_2432"></span>In its notice of proposed action, the agency asserted that between January 6, 2008, and July 18, 2009, the appellant "used 2,531 hours of leave, a majority of which was Leave Without Pay (LWOP), either under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or the Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a timely appeal. After holding a hearing, the administrative judge determined that, because the agency relied on approved FMLA leave for "many, or a majority, of dates listed in the proposed removal," its sole charge could not be sustained. However, the administrative judge determined that the appellant failed to prove her affirmative defenses of disability discrimination and reprisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge correctly held that FMLA absences cannot be used to support an adverse action.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, any employee who takes FMLA leave "for the intended purpose of the leave shall be entitled, upon return from such leave--(1) to be restored by the employing agency to the position held by the employee when the leave commenced; or (2) to be restored to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, status, and other terms and conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6384(a). Because Congress's clear intent when enacting FMLA was to provide job security for individuals who needed to be temporarily absent due to a serious medical condition (whether their own or that of a family member addressed by the FMLA legislation) and the law unambiguously promises this job security, use of FMLA in any calculation to remove an employee is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">McCauley v.

Therefore, it was improper for the agency to consider FMLA absences as a part of the equation when evaluating whether the appellant had failed to maintain a regular work schedule. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The charge of failure to maintain a regular work schedule should be upheld</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding that the majority of the absences relied upon by the agency to support the charge at issue here may have been FMLA-covered leave, the appellant's full legal entitlement to such leave during the relevant time period constituted at most 38 percent of the 2,531 hours of charged absence. We find the remaining 1,571 hours of charged absence to be sufficient to sustain the charge.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) The record showed that the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) The absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) The agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cook</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12. In <span class="Italic">Combs v. Social Security Administration</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 14 (2002), the Board applied the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> test to the agency's charge of inability to maintain regular attendance based on the appellant's excessive absenteeism. We agree with the agency that <span class="Italic">Cook</span> controls this case and, therefore, find that the administrative judge erred in failing to apply the test established therein to the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the appellant admitted in her written reply to the notice of proposed action that "it is impossible for [her] to keep a steady work schedule." The appellant's response to the agency's petition for review also indicates that the appellant could not regularly work five days per week. Thus, preponderant evidence establishes that the first <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criterion was met because the employee admitted that she was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant was notified on October 29, 2008, that she had exhausted her FMLA leave, that her agency needed a full-time staff member to perform her work, and that if her absences continued to be an "unreasonable burden, [her] proposed removal from the Agency and the Federal service [might] be initiated." After receiving this notice, the appellant was absent more than half of the time, mostly in LWOP status, during the following 10 months. Therefore, her absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the second <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criterion was met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the third <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criterion, the appellant's first-line supervisor testified that the appellant's absences were "causing an undue burden on the department as a whole" and that the agency was forced to hire additional contract support to fill in for the appellant. The agency has therefore demonstrated its need for the position to be filled by an individual who is available for duty. Accordingly, the agency has proven by preponderant evidence all three <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criteria, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 611-12, and therefore the failure to maintain a regular work schedule charge is sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her reply to the agency's petition for review, the appellant cites <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 17 (2003) in arguing that <span class="Italic">Cook</span> does not apply here because "there was a foreseeable end" to her absence from work as she had been cleared to return to work on October 27, 2009, "under certain restrictions." As a threshold matter, we note that, in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, the Board did not hold that a foreseeable end to an absence renders the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> analysis inapt. On the contrary, we merely recognized, consistent with <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, that "[p]rolonged absence with no foreseeable end can provide just cause for removal." <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 17. Moreover, we made that observation after noting the appellant's claim that she could not resume <span class="Italic">full</span> duty due to medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, in this appeal, the appellant's reply does not contain a copy of a document clearing her to return to work, nor does it cite its location in the record. However, the record does contain a document signed by Dr. Hamid Quraishi, in which he stated that the appellant could work no more than "3 days weekly" from October 27, 2009 to approximately December 18, 2009. As the agency established its need for a full-time employee, and the medical documentation in the record establishes that the appellant was not available to work full-time, we find the appellant's argument unpersuasive. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Because the appellant was absent more than half of the time, the penalty does not exceed the tolerable limits of reasonableness</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's determination of an appropriate penalty is not entitled to deference when the deciding official does not consider any of the relevant mitigating circumstances. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 425, 432 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Bivens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 458, 461 (1981)). While the notice of proposed action discussed the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the notice of decision did not contain any discussion of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and the deciding official in this case did not testify at the hearing. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). Therefore, we cannot hold by preponderant evidence that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were considered by the deciding official when determining the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the Board finds that an agency has failed to weigh the relevant factors, it may determine how the agency's decision should be corrected to bring the penalty within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Bivens</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 461; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 432. After the appellant was informed on October 29, 2008, that her absences created an unreasonable burden and might result in her proposed removal, the appellant was absent more than half of the time for the following 10 months. Her absences made it necessary for the agency to employ additional staff and affected management's ability to approve leave for other employees. Thus, the appellant was given clear notice, and her offense was serious. We have also considered mitigating factors such as the appellant's more than 13 years of Federal service as well as her medical condition and that of her husband. However, the damage to the efficiency of the service caused by an employee being absent more than half of the time, for such an extensive period, cannot be overcome by these mitigating factors. Accordingly, the agency's penalty of removal is affirmed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge noted that adverse actions generally could not be based on an employee's use of approved leave. She also noted, however, that the Board recognized an exception to this rule. Specifically, she noted that, under <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984), an adverse action based on the excessive use of approved leave could be sustained if the agency showed that the following three criteria had been met: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval of the leave was immaterial to the employee's presence on the job; (2) the absence continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken if the employee continued to be unavailable for duty; and (3) <span id="Page_2433"></span>the employee's position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After finding that the criteria had been met, the administrative judge sustained the charge against the appellant.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Cook</span> exception applies only to "unscheduled" absences. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holderness v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant argues that the <span class="Italic">Cook</span> criteria have not been met.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Edwards</span> noted that if an employee is entitled to sick leave sufficient to cover an absence, the employee may use the sick leave and may not be disciplined for the ensuing absence, but <span class="Italic">Edwards</span> was decided before <span class="Italic">McCauley</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">McCauley</span> examines excessive absence irrespective of the source of leave other than FMLA.

<p class="Body-Text">Citing <span class="Italic">McKenzie</span> and <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Richards v.

The line of case was summarized by <span class="Italic">Travis v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-13-0476-I-1 (NP 9/8/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may bring an adverse action against an employee for excessive absences, such as those accrued because of the continuing effects of an injury or illness. The following criteria, however, must have been met: (1) the employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Gartner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the initial decision, we find the agency failed to prove the second element of the charge. The agency notified the appellant on multiple occasions that her failure to return to work or submit acceptable medical documentation in support of her leave requests would result in a charge of AWOL and potential disciplinary action on that basis. The agency did not, however, notify the appellant that her failure to return to work could lead to discipline even if her absences were approved. Indeed, the appellant could have reasonably inferred from the agency's specific warning about AWOL that she would not face disciplinary action if she submitted sufficient medical documentation and her absences were approved, which is ultimately what took place. Absent the notice required under <span class="Italic">Cook</span>, the charge cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McCauley</span> and <span class="Italic">Cook</span> and their kin notwithstanding, agencies are not ordinarily to take disciplinary action against employees based on approved leave, including sick leave or leave without pay. <span class="Italic">Webb v. USPS</span>, 10 MSPR 536, 538, 542-43 (1982) (modified or overruled by <span class="Italic">McCauley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCAULEY_LINDA_DC_0752_09_0694_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER__612104.pdf">116 MSPR 484</a>, 489-90 &#x00B6; 10, 2011 MSPB 59 (2011), <span class="Italic">supra</span>), explained with respect to discipline that was based on LWOP (not sustained), while sustaining a mitigated penalty for periods of AWOL (allowing that in an appropriate case an agency may use an employee's record of approved leave in order to show that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his or her unreliable attendance):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, a preference eligible employee, was removed from his position as a Mail Handler, United States Postal Service, Tacoma, Washington, effective June 6, 1980, on a charge of excessive absenteeism. The agency's three specifications in support of the charge alleged that appellant was absent without leave (AWOL) from January 22 through March 6, 1980; that he was absent from work from March 10 through April 4, 1980 on leave without pay (LWOP); and that he was AWOL from April 6 through April 24, 1980. The alleged AWOL periods arose as a result of the agency's rejection of appellant's medical certification of the reasons for the absences.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before addressing the issue of the propriety of the penalty selected by the agency, the Board will further address the presiding official's finding on the agency's specification of LWOP in support of its charge of excessive absenteeism. The presiding official found that the agency's grant of LWOP to appellant from March 10 through April 4, 1980, for surgery on his foot and recuperation, constituted scheduled approved leave which could not form a basis for the removal action. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that a period of approved absence may not be considered along with a period of unapproved absence as a basis for a removal action. <span class="Italic">See Bond v. Vance,</span> 327 F.2d 901 (D.C. Cir. 1964). The Board has also held, in a case arising prior to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, that a removal action for unsatisfactory attendance where all of the absences are under approved leave cannot constitute a valid cause of action. <span class="Italic">In the Matter of Francis A. Kibort,</span> Docket Number AR752B90418 (June 29, 1979). The Board stated the rationale for its holding in <span class="Italic">Kibort</span> at 3-4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding the agency's assertion to the contrary, the former Civil Service Commission had a policy that, given an agency's authority to deny leave under many circumstances when it must have the services of an employee, when an agency approved an employee's request for leave, it thereby released him/her from the obligation to report for duty. Consequently, such an absence was not considered to be a breach of the employer-employee relationship, and an adverse action based on a record of approved leave normally would not be deemed to be for such cause as promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authorization of LWOP is a matter of administrative discretion and employees may not demand that they be granted LWOP as a matter of right. <span class="Italic">Desiderio v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPB 171 (1980). In granting or denying LWOP, an agency should consider whether the employee's services can be spared and the legitimacy of the reasons for requesting LWOP. <span class="Italic">Kibort,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 4. Although an agency needs a dependable workforce and the very absence of an employee arguably disrupts the efficiency of the service, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Kibort</span> that where an agency grants an employee's request for LWOP it gives its official approval to the absences and it must be presumed that the approving agency officials had, in fact, made a determination that the employee's duty presence was not required. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 4. Therefore, an employee's instances of LWOP should not be considered against him or her as the basis for an adverse action as such leave constituted presumed approved leave after a determination that the employee's absence for the leave period is acceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concludes that it would be inequitable to allow an agency to take an adverse action against an employee based on his or her utilization of approved leave. Such would also be precluded by the laws (5 U.S.C. Ch. 63) and regulations (5 C.F.R. Part 630) that entitle and employee to use annual and sick leave within prescribed circumstances and limitations. Adverse actions based on periods of approved leave would have such a negative influence on the exercise of these rights so as to deny them. Additionally, the employer-employee relationship created at the time one commences his or her employment in the federal service allows for the adverse effects of approved leave usage to the extent that it is properly exercised and is within the limits of the annual and sick leave periods specified. Therefore, an adverse action taken by an agency against an employee based on periods of approved leave is not "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Accordingly, the Board finds that the presiding official properly determined that the agency's grant of LWOP to appellant could not be used as a specification in support of the removal action.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although periods of approved leave may not form the basis for an adverse action, an agency, in an otherwise appropriate case, may use an employee's record of approved leave in order to show that the employee is of marginal value to the agency because of his or her unreliable attendance. An agency may properly consider an "employee's past work record, including length of service, performance on the job, ability to get along with fellow workers, and dependability..." as a factor in determining the appropriateness of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313,332 (1981). However, the underlying facts relating to such a factor must be proven by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 324. The Board declines to consider the period of LWOP in this case as a factor against appellant in determining the appropriateness of the penalty. Inasmuch as the <span id="Page_2434"></span>agency granted appellant LWOP with the full knowledge that the leave was necessary for his surgery and recuperation, the Board finds that it would be inappropriate to consider the leave period as a factor against him in determining the appropriateness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Cade v. Postal Service,</span> 8 MSPB 362 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a distinction between inability to meet attendance requirements and AWOL. If AWOL is charged but not proved, the employee cannot be fired for an unstated charge of poor attendance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kufel v. USPS</span>, 11 MSPR 633 (1982) (appellant was out because of illness and he was apparently advised by the agency that he was being placed on leave until further notice). [Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-091.html#sec12-87">Alteration of Work Schedule, Worksite; Telework,</a>" concerning <span class="Italic">Combs v. SSA</span>, 91 MSPR 148 (2002), for the relation between jobs requiring a definite work schedule, removal for medical inability to perform the duties of a position, and affirmative defenses of disability discrimination.]</p>
