<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-37"><span class="space">C.</span> PRECLUSION</h3>
<p class="noindent">A contract grievance procedure may preclude judicial Tucker Act jurisdiction over a claim asserted under the Back Pay Act. That result was reached in a case involving claims for environmental differential pay for prevailing rate employees who were members of a bargaining unit. Without much discussion of why the Civil Service Reform Act precluded the basis for a suit that was permitted during the days of the Executive Order, the Federal Circuit determined that <span class="Italic">Fausto v. United States</span>, 108 S. Ct. 668 (1988), and <span class="Italic">United States v. Erika, Inc.</span>, 456 U.S. 201 (1982), meant that Reform Act provisions establishing broad and exclusive grievance procedures superseded prior Tucker Act jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit ventured no opinion as to claims under "nationwide federal" laws, e.g., the Fair Labor Standards Act, citing as precedent <span class="Italic">Arkansas Best Freight Sys.</span>, 450 U.S. 728 (1981), to distinguish treatment of those cases. <span class="Italic">Harris v. United States</span>, 841 F.2d 1097, 1100 (Fed. Cir. 1988). However, in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1457-58 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the Federal Circuit determined that the existence of a CSRA grievance procedure covering FLSA claims preempts an FLSA suit in district court that would otherwise be based on the portion of the FLSA placing jurisdiction to hear those suits in federal courts. By electing to bring themselves within the coverage of a negotiated agreement and broad grievance procedure, employees had also elected an exclusive remedy for the matters within the scope of that procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hennessey v. DOD</span>, 46 F.3d 356, 360 (4th Cir. 1995) (permitting an FLSA suit to proceed to district court when a negotiated agreement specifically exempted matters relating to overtime entitlement under the FLSA from arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1994, Congress amended the Reform Act to narrow the preclusive effect of the election of remedies provisions governing grievance arbitration, and those amendments were interpreted by the Federal Circuit to overrule <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and to permit employees to pursue employment claims in court that could otherwise be taken to court if there were no grievance procedure. The Federal Circuit explained the change in the statute, and its effect upon overtime claims pursued in court, in <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1220, 1222-32 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court dismissed Mudge's complaint on the ground that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1), which is part of the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 71 01 <span class="Italic">et</span> <span class="Italic">seq</span>. (2000), deprived the court of jurisdiction. That statutory paragraph and the subsequent paragraph read as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. <span id="page_2550"></span>Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (a) (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he heart of the dispute--whether the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over a claim that falls within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedures--centers, as it did below, on the meaning of the term "administrative" in &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to 1994, the statute did not contain the term "administrative." Rather, &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) stated that the grievance procedures set forth in a CBA would "be the <span class="Italic">exclusive procedures</span> for resolving grievances which f[ell] within its coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) (1 988) (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Carter </span>v. Gibbs, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, Carter </span>v. Gibbs, 498 U.S. 811 (1990), this court interpreted the pre-1994 language to preclude federal employees from resolving grievances covered by their CBA in court. Relying on the "unambiguous" text of unamended &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1), which stated that "the procedures shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage," <span class="Italic">Carter</span> held that the statute limited the resolution of such grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in an employee's CBA. <span class="Italic">Carter,</span> 909 F.2d at 1454. Like Mr. Mudge, the appellants in <span class="Italic">Carter</span> did not contest that their claims, pay disputes under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), constituted "grievances" subject to the negotiated procedures<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Nor did they argue that subsections (a)(2), (c), (d), or (e) removed their claims from the application of those procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1454-55. Instead, appellants argued that they were exempt from &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1)'s exclusivity provision because to hold otherwise would allow the CSRA to implicitly repeal their right to sue under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1454. In other words, appellants urged this court to read an additional exception into &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), one that would allow them to bring their FLSA claims in court despite the availability of administrative redress under their CBA's negotiated grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1455. Heeding "the Supreme Court's admonition to leave the architecture of the federal personnel system to Congress," we declined to do so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1456 (quoting <span class="Italic">Volk v. Hobson</span>, 866 F.2d 1398, 1403 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1994, Congress amended the CSRA by adding subsection (g) to &#x00A7; 7121. United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(b), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994) (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C. and 12 U.S.C.). This subsection gives "whistleblowers" the choice of resolving their employment grievances through either the negotiated procedures contained in their CBA or through certain administrative avenues enumerated in &#x00A7; 7121(g).<span class="Italic"> See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (g) (2000). Concurrent with the creation of subsection (g), Congress made two changes to subsection (a)(1). First, Congress amended &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) to refer to subsection (g). Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(c), 108 Stat. 4361 (1 994). As such, &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1)'s exclusivity provision now applies "[e]xcept as provided in subsections (d), (e), <span class="Italic">and (g)."</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) (2000) (emphasis added). Second, and critically, Congress added the contested term "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(c), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994). In other words, it added the term "administrative" to the phrase "shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances" previously construed in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. Congress styled both of these changes to &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) as "Technical and Conforming Amendments<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing else in the direct legislative history of the 1994 amendments informs the meaning of the term "administrative" or Congress's intent in adding the word to &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1). H.R. 2970, the bill that ultimately amended &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1), passed the House without the term "administrative," and the word was only added later as a floor amendment in the Senate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 140 Cong. Rec. 27,361 and 28,823-28 (1994). While the House subsequently adopted the Senate's amendment to the bill, <span class="Italic">see id</span> 29,350, neither the House nor the Senate provided a discussion or an explanation of the disputed term. As far as the amendments' indirect history is concerned, two National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU") officials testified during the subcommittee hearings on H.R. 2970 that Congress should overrule <span class="Italic">Carter</span> by clarifying that while negotiated grievance procedures constitute a federal employee's exclusive administrative remedy, they do not foreclose access to available judicial remedies.<span class="Italic"> See To Reauthorize the Office of Special Counsel and to Make Amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act: Hearing on H.R. 2970 Before the SubComm. on the Civil Servs. of the House Comm. on Post Office &#x0026; Civil Servs.</span>, 103d Cong. 20-23 (1993) (statements of Tim Hannapel, Assistant Counsel in the Office of General Counsel, NTEU, and Robert M. Tobias, President, NTEU). Additionally, a House committee report accompanying a different bill, H.R. 2721, that failed to pass either the House of Representatives or the Senate stated that the addition of "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121 would clarify that "[t]he grievance procedure was never intended to deprive employees of access to the courts" and thereby "correct" the decision in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. Federal Employee Fairness Act of 1994, H.R. Rep. No. 103-599, pt. 1, at 56 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at pt. 2, at 75 (stating that the proposed addition of the word "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121 would "clarify that section 7121 is not intended to limit judicial remedies otherwise provided by law.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that Congress's addition of the word "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121(a) established a federal employee's right to seek a judicial remedy for employment grievances subject to the negotiated procedures contained in his or her CBA. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Carter</span> held otherwise, the court based its decision on the language of the statute as it read prior to the 1994 amendments and that decision is therefore no longer applicable. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Federal Claim's dismissal of Mr. Mudge's claim for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e begin our inquiry with the text of the CSRA itself. Section 7121(a)(1) directs that, with a few enumerated exceptions, the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in a federal employee's CBA are to be "the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedures for resolving grievances that fall within [the CBA's] coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (2000) (emphasis added). Because the statute does not define the word "administrative," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103, we presume that Congress intended to give that term its ordinarily understood meaning, <span class="Italic">see Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer</span>, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995) ("When terms used in a statute are undefined, we give them their ordinary meaning.") (internal citation omitted). In ascertaining the common meaning of an undefined statutory term, the court may refer to the dictionary. <span class="Italic">See Kovo Seiko Co. v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 36 F.3d 1565, 1571 n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("A dictionary is an appropriate source for gleaning...'ordinary meaning."'). Consulting <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, we find the meaning of "administrative" to be "distinguished from such [functions and acts] as are judicial." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 45 (6th ed. 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Carter</span>, 909 F.2d at 1455 (noting the distinction between the administrative and judicial arenas). The plain language of &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) as amended is therefore clear: while &#x00A7; 7121 (a)(1) limits the administrative resolution of a federal employee's grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in his or her CBA, the text of the statute does not restrict an employee's right to seek a judicial remedy for such grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that "[a] leading purpose of the CSRA was to replace the haphazard arrangements for administrative and judicial review of personnel action, part of the outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century that was the civil service system." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 444 (1988) (internal quotation omitted). As we stated in <span class="Italic">Muniz v. United States</span>, 972 F.2d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 1992), "the Congressionally unambiguous and unmistakable preference from exclusivity of arbitration is a central part of the comprehensive overhaul of the civil service system provided by the CSRA." We cannot agree, however, with an interpretation of &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) that privileges these policy concerns to the exclusion of the plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Artuz v. Bennett</span>, 531 U.S. 4, 10 (2000) ("Whatever merits these and other policy arguments may have, it is not the province of this Court to rewrite the statute to accommodate them. We hold as we do because respondent's view seems to us the only permissible interpretation of the text."). Moreover, we disagree with the government's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. As discussed above, <span class="Italic">Carter</span> based its holding on the "unambiguous" language of the pre-1994 text of &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 909 F.2d at 1454. While the court subsequently addressed the general purposes animating the CSRA, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1455-56, it did so in order to reject appellants' argument that "an additional exception to CSRA section 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision should be implied," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1455. <span class="Italic">Carter</span> therefore relied on policy considerations to reject appellants' assertion that the court should interpret unamended &#x00A7; 7121(a) contrary to its clear language; it did not, as the government urges us to do today, "follo[w] the overall purpose of the statutory scheme" in order to disregard subsection (a)(1)'s plain text. Following <span class="Italic">Carter</span>'s example, we interpret amended &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) according to its unambiguous language and conclude that that subsection no longer restricts a federal employee's right to pursue an employment grievance in court.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the jurisdictional issue is arguable, ordinarily a federal district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain claims by employees or unions that their First Amendment or Reform Act rights have been violated. The Reform Act provides the means for addressing those claims through arbitration, the Office of Special Counsel, the MSPB, and the processes of the FLRA. The comprehensive nature of the Reform Act preempts the authority of district courts under the general federal question statute, 28 USC 1331. <span class="Italic">Carter v.

<p class="noindent-1">The CSRA provides "the exclusive avenue for suit" to a plaintiff whose claims fall within its scope. <span class="Italic">Grosdidier</span>, 560 F.3d at 497.

<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the CSRA, also known as the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (FSLMRS), governs federal labor-management relations. The FSLMRS "establishes a comprehensive scheme to deal with labor relations in federal employment." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def. v. FLRA,</span> 685 F.2d 641, 644 (D.C. Cir. 1982). For example, the FSLMRS creates the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), a five-member decisionmaking body that is the public-sector counterpart of the National Labor Relations Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7104; <span class="Italic">Rizzitelli v. FLRA</span>, 212 F.3d 710, 712 n.1 (2d Cir. 2000). The FSLMRS spells out various unfair labor practices, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116, and defines the duty to bargain between federal management and unions, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7117. With the FSLMRS, as with all of the CSRA: "Congress passed an enormously complicated and subtle scheme to govern employee relations in the federal sector, including the authorization of collective bargaining. It follows, then, that federal employees may not circumvent that structure" by seeking judicial review outside the CSRA's procedures. <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS provides several alternative mechanisms to challenge management actions, three of which are pertinent here. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. First, an aggrieved party may resort to a grievance resolution and arbitration procedure that the FSLMRS requires be included in every collective bargaining agreement. Unless a specific statutory or contract exception applies, that procedure is "the exclusive administrative procedure[&#8197;] for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). After arbitration, either party may file with the FLRA exceptions to an arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122(a). The FLRA reviews the award to ensure that it is not "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation" or otherwise deficient on any ground "similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor management relations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Second, the FSLMRS permits a union to bargain over a challenged management action; and if management asserts that the matter is non-negotiable, the union can pursue a negotiability appeal with the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7117(c); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of Def</span>., 685 F.2d at 644-45. Third, to the extent that management enforces a policy that violates a collective bargaining agreement predating the policy, "any person" can lodge an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(7), 7118(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS also provides for judicial review of an FLRA order by petitioning for review in this circuit or "in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123(a). And, although there are two exceptions to judicial review in the appropriate court of appeals,[3] "this does not mean the district courts are open. It means that review is precluded in any court." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Empls. v. Loy</span>, 367 F.3d 932, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2004). To the extent an FLRA order is judicially reviewable, then, it may be reviewed <span class="Italic">only</span> in the appropriate court of appeals, not in district court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The two exceptions are: an order under "(1) section 7122 of this title (involving an award by an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118 of this title, or (2) section 7112 of this title (involving an appropriate unit determination)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Jurisdictional Issue</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FSLMRS's remedial regime is exclusive, providing AFGE with multiple options to challenge the dress code, AFGE cannot circumvent this regime by instead bringing a suit in district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, AFGE has at least three administrative options it can use to challenge the dress code. First, a local can attempt to bargain over the dress code and, if the Air Force claims the dress code is non-negotiable, the local can file a negotiability appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c). In fact, the record includes the example of AFGE Local 1367--one of the appellants--bargaining with the Air Force over this issue and ultimately pursuing a negotiability appeal with the FLRA (which the FLRA rejected). Second, an AFGE local can allege that imposition of the dress code violates 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 10216--the claim AFGE raises <span class="Italic">sub judice</span>. Such an allegation easily falls within the definition of a "grievance"[4] under the FSLMRS and thus can be challenged using collective bargaining agreement grievance and arbitration procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. For example, AFGE Local 2361--a plaintiff in district court but not an appellant here--filed a grievance regarding the Air Force instructions and obtained a <span class="Italic">favorable</span> ruling from the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Appendix 21-44 ("The Employer violates the Agreement by unilaterally requiring ARTs employees to wear military uniforms while in civilian status performing civilian duties....&#8197;The Employer shall...not apply the uniform requirements for ARTs in civilian status...for the life of the Agreement unless and until the Union agrees to modify the Agreement to permit those requirements or similar changes."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Appendix 78 (denying grievance brought by AFGE Local 1778, another non-appealing plaintiff). Third, to the extent the dress code conflicts with an existing collective bargaining agreement, an aggrieved party can file an unfair labor practice charge over the issue. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(7), 7118(a)(1). For example, AFGE Locals 2316 (an appellant here) and 3854 (a plaintiff in district court but not an appellant here) have attempted to challenge the Air Force instructions in this manner. In fact, we have already decided a petition for review regarding one local's different challenge to the same Air Force instructions. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841, 848 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (granting Air Force's petition for review of FLRA decision that union proposal for uniform cleaning is negotiable condition of employment). The FSLMRS does not, however, authorize the dress code to be challenged by way of a lawsuit begun in district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;A "grievance" includes a complaint "by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning...any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CSRA can preclude a claim from being brought in a district court even if it forecloses the claim from administrative review and has not "identified some other kind of plaintiff or some other kind of procedure for bringing the claim." <span class="Italic">Filebark</span>, 555 F.3d at 1013. The case for preclusion is stronger here because the FSLMRS in fact provides a means to review the Air Force instructions--including, in some circumstances, judicial review--via at least these three routes. While the appellants may not prevail using one of these procedures or would prefer to challenge the Air Force instructions by some other means, that does not mean their claims may be brought outside the CSRA's exclusive remedial scheme. Rather, as we have explained, "it is the comprehensiveness of the statutory scheme involved, not the 'adequacy' of specific remedies thereunder, that counsels judicial abstention." <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Mathis</span>, 859 F.2d 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The appellants argue that while the CSRA may preclude the AFGE locals' claims, it does not preclude the claims of National AFGE. Specifically, they complain that National AFGE--unlike an employee or a union local with a collective bargaining agreement with the Air Force--has no relief under the FSLMRS and thus should be permitted to proceed outside the CSRA to seek relief. But the fact that National AFGE may not pursue a claim through the CSRA does not mean that it has access to the courts. Rather, it means that National AFGE may not raise the claim at all. The CSRA's exclusion of certain parties from judicial review is "not an invitation to those [parties] to sue under other statutes but a 'manifestation of a <span id="page_2552"></span>considered congressional judgment that they should not have statutory entitlement to review.'" <span class="Italic">Filebark</span>, 555 F.3d at 1013 (quoting <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 448-49); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Billington</span>, 681 F.3d 377, 388 (D.C. Cir. 2012) ("Indeed, the only evidence Davis uses to suggest he is not 'included' in the CSRA's comprehensive remedial scheme is the lack of relief available to him under that scheme....&#8197;[T]his is certainly not a sufficient reason to place a claimant and his claims outside the ambit of a comprehensive remedial scheme...."). The FSLMRS provides the exclusive procedures by which federal employees and their bargaining representatives may assert federal labor-management relations claims. To the extent the procedures omit other parties--like a national labor organization (at least one that is not party to a collective bargaining agreement)--we presume that exclusion is intentional. Were we to hold otherwise, a union local could circumvent the CSRA's strictures by requesting that a national union file general APA claims outside the CSRA on behalf. We decline to allow National AFGE, which here asserts only the rights of its member-employees and member union locals, to file a suit outside the CSRA simply because it cannot do so under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Sackett v. EPA</span>, 132 S. Ct. 1367, 1374 (2012) ("Where a statute provides that particular agency action is reviewable at the instance of one party, who must first exhaust administrative remedies, the inference that it is not reviewable at the instance of other parties, who are not subject to the administrative process, is strong."); <span class="Italic">see also Elgin v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 132 S. Ct. 2126, 2133 (2012) ("Just as the CSRA's 'elaborate' framework demonstrates Congress' intent to entirely foreclose judicial review to employees to whom the CSRA denies statutory review, it similarly indicates that extrastatutory review is not available to those employees to whom the CSRA grants administrative and judicial review." (citation omitted)).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We reject the argument that "[t]he doctrine of associational standing entitles the National AFGE to adjudicate a nationwide claim." Standing <span class="Italic">vel non</span> is a different issue from claim preclusion under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors</span>, 589 F.3d 445, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (plaintiff's claim precluded by CSRA notwithstanding plaintiff's standing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, we reject AFGE's argument that the district court has jurisdiction because it can more efficiently adjudicate AFGE's claim that the Air Force instructions are contrary to statute on a nationwide, rather than local-by-local, basis. But a plaintiff's inability to use the APA to circumvent the CSRA's requirements "applies to a 'systemwide challenge' to an agency policy interpreting a statute just as it does to the implementation of such a policy in a particular case." <span class="Italic">Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Governors</span>, 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009).[6] Nor may a party avoid the CSRA because it provides only an "inconvenient" remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The controllers do have a remedy: if the FAA fails to live up to its agreements, the union can pursue the matter and if the union fails to live up to its duty of representation, the controllers can pursue the union. These procedures surely lack the directness and immediacy of an APA suit, and the controllers have apparently found them frustrating. But the choice of procedures lies with Congress[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Filebark</span>, 555 F.3d at 1014 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;AFGE does not request that we apply the exception discussed in <span class="Italic">Leedom v. Kyne</span>, 358 U.S. 184 (1958), nor would we apply it if AFGE had so argued. <span class="Italic">See Nyunt</span>, 589 F.3d at 449 (<span class="Italic">Leedom</span> exception permits "judicial review of agency action for alleged statutory violations even when a statute precludes review...where (i) the statutory preclusion of review is implied rather than express; (ii) there is no alternative procedure for review of the statutory claim; and (iii) the agency plainly acts in excess of its delegated powers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is 'clear and mandatory'"; to satisfy the third requirement the "agency error must be so extreme that one may view it as jurisdictional or nearly so" (citations and quotation marks omitted)). In <span class="Italic">Nyunt</span>, we emphasized that the <span class="Italic">Leedom</span> exception is like "a Hail Mary pass" that "rarely succeeds." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, AFGE's reliance on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d 341 (D.C. Cir. 2007) is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Nicholson</span>, an AFGE local representing nurses employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) won an arbitration award against the VA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 346. When the VA refused to recognize the award, the local filed an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 345. Subsequently, the VA Under Secretary--acting under a specific statute pertaining only to VA employees--issued an order making it impossible to enforce the arbitration award. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 345. The statute provided that the Under Secretary's order "'may not be reviewed by any other agency.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d)). The FLRA dismissed the unfair labor practice charge, concluding that both the order and the statute deprived it of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The local then filed a complaint in district court challenging the Under Secretary's decision insulating the unfair labor practice claim from FLRA review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Emphasizing that the local challenged the Under Secretary's decision as opposed to an FLRA decision, we held that the CSRA did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 347-48. <span class="Italic">Nicholson</span> is distinguishable because it involved a challenge to the Under Secretary's order insulating the underlying dispute from review, an order that is "expressly outside the FLRA's purview." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 348.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the district court erroneously used the administrative exhaustion doctrine to dismiss the complaint. <span class="Italic">See Am. Fed. of Gov't Empls</span>., 841 F. Supp.2d at 236. Administrative exhaustion means that a party cannot bring a claim in a particular court until that party follows certain administrative steps. But if judicial review were available to AFGE, it would be available in circuit, not district, court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). Thus, AFGE's argument that we should waive the requirements of "administrative exhaustion" for equitable reasons misses the point: the exclusive remedial scheme of the CSRA keeps these claims out of the district court entirely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Congress has provided multiple paths by which AFGE can challenge the Air Force instructions. And AFGE cannot disturb the CSRA's exclusive remedial regime by following a path the Congress has closed.</p>
