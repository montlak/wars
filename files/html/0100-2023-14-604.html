<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-605"><span class="space">A.</span> SPECIFIC ELEMENTS AND STANDARDS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals to set performance standards for job retention (minimally satisfactory) and within-grade increases (fully satisfactory), were nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, 3 FLRA 769, 769-70, 772-73 (1980) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982), <span class="Italic">post</span>). FLRA framed the issue to be whether a proposal identifying a critical element and performance standard violated the right of management to assign work or whether those matters were bargainable in accordance with the section of 5 USC 4302 that requires agencies to encourage employee participation in the establishment of performance standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4302 of the CSRA requires each agency to develop one or more performance appraisal systems and states the basic requirements of such systems....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4302 makes no distinctions between an agency's responsibility to encourage participation by employees within units of exclusive recognition and unrepresented employees.... [T]he express provisions of section 7114 require that an exclusive representative be given the opportunity to be represented at certain meetings between management and employees relating to the development and implementation of performance systems. In summary, it is the Statute, and not section 4302, which controls whether the identification of critical elements and the content of performance standards are within the scope of the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">After discussing OPM regulations governing performance appraisal systems, at 5 CFR Part 430, FLRA continued, 3 FLRA at 775-81:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to direct employees in the agency is not defined in the Statute, is not specifically discussed in the legislative history, and has not been applied in prior decisions of the Authority. Therefore, consistent with the main purpose and meaning of the Statute and in the absence of any indication that the phrase as used in the Statute has a meaning other than its ordinary meaning, the right "to direct...employees in the agency" means to supervise and guide them in the performance of their duties on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work to employees or positions under section 7106(a), subject to the provisions of section 7106(b), is composed of two <span id="page_1065"></span>discretionary elements: (1) the particular duties and work to be assigned, and (2) the particular employees to whom or positions to which it will be assigned. Furthermore, management discretion in this regard includes the right to assign general continuing duties, to make specific periodic work assignments to employees, to determine when such assignments will occur, and to determine when the work which has been assigned will be performed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he rights to direct employees and assign work are exercised through supervising and determining the quantity and timeliness of work production, and establishing priorities for its accomplishment. The establishing of "critical elements" and "performance standards" as provided for in law and defined by regulation are among the ways in which management supervises and determines the quality, quantity, and timeliness of work required of employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Union's proposal is not procedural. It would require the Agency to bargain over its statutory authority to direct employees and assign work. It specifies a critical element of an employee's job and the performance standard with respect to the job element which must be met for job retention, thereby directly interfering with the statutory right of management to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This decision does not mean that all matters related to establishing performance appraisal systems are outside the duty to bargain.&#x2003;Consistent with the intent of Congress as expressed in section 7101 and other sections of the Statute, performance appraisal systems, apart from the identification of critical elements and the establishment of performance standards, are within the duty to bargain, to the extent they are consistent with law and regulation. To the extent that an agency has discretion with respect to a given matter related to such systems the agency must upon request negotiate with an exclusive representative over that matter. In particular...section 4302(a)(2) of the CSRA requires that performance appraisal systems "encourage employee participation in establishing performance standards" but does not specify the form which such employee participation must take. Consequently, among other significant aspects of performance appraisal systems, the manner in which a particular agency provides for such employee participation is within the agency's discretion and, therefore, within the duty to bargain to the extent that it would not prevent the agency from establishing performance standards and critical elements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the right of an exclusive representative to negotiate provisions related to the form of the employee participation required under section 4302...section 7114 require[s] that an exclusive representative be given the opportunity to be represented at certain meetings between management and employees relating to the development and the implementation of performance appraisal systems....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As it pertains to the matters here in dispute, section 7114 provides that an exclusive representative is entitled to be represented at any meeting between a representative of the agency and a unit employee which constitutes a formal discussion within the meaning of the Statute and which involves matters pertaining to performance appraisal systems, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the identification of critical elements and the establishment of performance standards. Similarly, the exclusive representative is entitled to be represented at an examination of an employee in connection with an investigation whenever a unit employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action for unacceptable performance under section 4303....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, section 7106(b)(2) provides that management has a duty to bargain on the procedures which management officials will observe in exercising section 7106 rights. Similarly, section 7106(b)(3) provides that management has a duty to bargain on appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its authority.... Thus, to the extent consistent with law and regulation, the procedural context of performance evaluation, including procedures related to the identification of critical elements and the establishment of performance standards, and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by actions taken under those standards, are subject to bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With further reference to procedures, OPM suggested an exclusive representative could negotiate with regard to the process by which critical elements and performance standards are communicated to employees, periodic appraisals at least on an annual basis, the manner in which the performance of employees on detail will be appraised, the manner in which an employee's disagreement with his or her performance appraisal will be reviewed, and the process by which proposed performance standards will be reviewed within the agency. Creative approaches to collective bargaining may expand the possibilities suggested....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, an employee against whom disciplinary action has been taken based on unacceptable performance under section 4303 of CSRA, may appeal the action to the Merit Systems Protection Board pursuant to section 7701 of the CSRA or, alternatively, raise the matter in the negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to section 7121. In the context of negotiated grievance procedures it would be possible for an employee against whom action has been taken for unacceptable performance to grieve such action, contending that the performance standard as applied to the grievant pursuant to which the discipline was imposed is improper, or impossible of performance, under requirements of law or the parties' agreement. With regard to the requirements of law, section 4302(b)(1) of the CSRA requires that performance standards be objective and job-related. As was acknowledged by OPM at oral argument, in the case of an employee subject to discipline for unacceptable performance, an arbitrator would be able to find a standard as applied was not objective or job-related in ruling on a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]othing in this decision would preclude an exclusive representative from negotiating criteria for application of performance standards which management has established. As the Authority determined with respect to a proposal requiring that performance standards be "fair and equitable" in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 32 and Office of Personnel Management, Washington, D.C.</span>, 3 FLRA No. <span class="Italic">120</span> (1980),...such a criterion would not interfere with the agency's discretion as to the identification of critical elements and the establishment of the content of a particular performance standard. This criterion would merely establish a general requirement by which the application of critical elements and performance standards established by management could subsequently be evaluated when they are challenged in a grievance filed pursuant to Section 7121(e) of the Statute. This type of review would not preclude the agency from initially determining the content of the standard, nor would it result in substitution of an arbitrator's judgment for that of the agency and setting a new standard. It would simply determine if the standard established by management as applied to the grievant complied with the requirements of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">A court affirmed <span class="Italic">Bureau of Pub. Debt</span> in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 691 F.2d 553, 562-65 (D.C. Cir. 1982). After discussing the nature of the performance appraisal process, the significance of critical elements and performance standards, the legislative debate concerning negotiable and nonnegotiable rights and procedures, and the usual standard of review of deference to FLRA's administrative determinations, the court said of proposals that set specific standards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority concluded that, by virtue of the provisions of Section 7106(a), management retained the nonnegotiable right to determine what work will be done, and by whom and when.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also considered this right properly exercisable in part through formulation of performance standards for critical job elements.... [P]erformance standards for critical job elements were deemed by the Authority to be directly determinative of the level of work output and caliber of work product to be achieved....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We can find no error in this reasoning....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In concluding that performance standards for critical elements of an employee's job not only serve as a basis upon which past employee performance can be measured, but also tend in the first instance to establish the level of output that is to be achieved, the Authority made a judgment and balance we are not at liberty to disturb....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Section 7106(b)...specifically directs agency officials to bargain over the procedures to be used in exercising managerial authority, and over the arrangements appropriate for employees adversely affected by such exercises. The agency may thus be required, in compliance with Section 4302's mandate of employee participation, to negotiate on procedures governing establishment of performance standards and identification of critical job elements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, as the Authority has also recognized, any employee may challenge an established performance standard in the context of a grievance proceeding conducted pursuant to the Act. Thus, should disciplinary action be taken against an employee on the ground of unacceptable performance, that employee may claim during an ensuing grievance proceeding that the standard by which his or her performance was measured is not objective or not job-related, or that it is inherently impossible of performance. Our decision today does not deprive federal employees of input into the development of performance-appraisal systems, or their ability to challenge components of such a system once in place.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reaffirmed that, despite negotiability of proposals permitting challenges to the legality or application of performance standards, the standards themselves are nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Proposals setting numerical or percentage levels of achievement for performance standards at various levels interfere with the right of management to assign work and direct employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS</span>, 13 FLRA 329, 331 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and DOD, Defense Fin. and <span id="page_1066"></span>Accounting Serv.</span>, 45 FLRA 910, 911-14 (1992) (Provision 1 was nonnegotiable, requiring that ratings and three different levels be based on accomplishment of stated percentages of performance standards set by agency). A proposal is nonnegotiable that either defines relative weights for critical elements in the performance appraisal process or that requires performance standards to be the same for the same position descriptions. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1497 and Hq., Lowry Technical Training Ctr., Lowry AFB</span>, 6 FLRA 9, 9-10 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 56 FLRA 1115, 1116 (2001) (Proposal 1: "As the proposal would establish the particular levels of performance required to achieve a particular summary performance rating, it affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals that define how efficiency is measured by allowing certain functions not to be charged against an employee's productivity essentially set performance standards. They are nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 12 FLRA 17, 17-18 (1983). Designated performance expectations, as opposed to performance standards, have the same effect and are nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">IRS, Kansas City Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 693, 698-99, 702 (1985) (ALJ Decision). Indirect measures fare no better. A proposal providing a level of efficiency for purposes of step increases and grade retention was inconsistent with management's right to set performance standards. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS, Austin Serv. Ctr.</span>, 11 FLRA 271, 271-73 (1983). A proposal was not negotiable that set a limit on the number of cases worked by an employee that could be used to assess employee productivity. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 15 FLRA 909, 913-15 (1984). A proposal that establishes a criterion for determining the level of performance needed to justify an unacceptable rating restricts management's discretion to determine levels of performance sufficient for certain ratings and interferes with management's right to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 214-18 (1987). It matters not whether standards are explicitly linked in the proposal to Chapter 43. If they define criteria supporting employee retention and step increases, they are performance standards and nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1395 and SSA, Great Lakes Program Ctr.,</span> 14 FLRA 408, 410 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1987, FLRA decided <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384 (1987) (<span class="Italic">POPA</span>) (<span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO, Dept. of Commerce</span>, 29 FLRA 1389 (1987)), involving aspects of performance standards and appraisal systems established for employees of the Patent Office. The Patent Office Professional Association, represented patent examiners whose work was essentially similar, although spread through different technologies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Probably the most important point established by <span class="Italic">POPA</span> involved application of the appropriate arrangements test to performance standards. FLRA determined that the test was inapplicable. A change or the initiation of performance standards could not, by itself, provide the basis for the negotiation of substantive aspects of the standards. FLRA reasoned that the issuance of a standard in and of itself did not warrant an inference that an employee would likely be adversely affected by the standard. The employee should wait and see what occurred when the standard was actually applied to him through either appraisal or some type of performance-based action. FLRA rested its decision on that point upon a decision of the Fourth Circuit, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 791 F.2d 324, 327 (4th Cir. 1986), concluding that a change in job requirements does not trigger arrangements bargaining obligations. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-717.html#sec6-718">Midterm; Negotiability and Future Disputes</a>," concerning impact bargaining requirements concerning new standards and changes in old standards.]</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA</span> made some other significant rulings concerning peripheral bargaining on performance standards. The union may not compel management to bargain over terms used in standards. If a phrase used in a standard concerns whether "clear error" has been committed, FLRA will not direct bargaining over the meaning of that phrase. That went beyond procedural aspects of the standard and intruded upon management's right to establish the substance of the standard. <span class="Italic">POPA</span> also rejected several proposals concerning standards that the union argued were procedural. FLRA reaffirmed that management could not be compelled to agree that like standards would be established for like positions or that management would be required to provide cogent explanations for distinctions in standards for similar positions. The problem was that an arbitrator could invalidate management's chosen standards if they did not meet the contractual criteria. The proposals allowed an arbitrator to review standards in advance of their application through appraisals or performance-based actions, contrary to case law developed by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA</span> determined that the union could not compel negotiation of detailed procedures for validating standards to ensure that they were accurate and objective. Comprehensive validation procedures would go beyond the requirements of cases decided by the MSPB and Federal Circuit allowing managers considerable leeway in defining standards within the overall statutory requirement of objectivity. Negotiations could not compel management to use standards more objective than required by existing case law for performance-based actions. MSPB and, to an extent, the Board's reviewing court, the Federal Circuit, would establish the outer parameters for objectivity of standards.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA</span> rejected attempts by the union to compel management to negotiate over adjustments to standards taking into account factors beyond employees' control, e.g., fluctuations in workload, changing technology, availability of research materials, conflicts in production requirements. The adjustments were of a substantive nature and therefore intruded on management's right to assign work and direct employees through unilateral imposition of standards. Nonnegotiable were proposals that sought essentially the same result from a different perspective: provisions compelling management to agree that ratings based on standards would be adjusted for various factors beyond the control of employees. The proposals infringed on the right of management to impose standards and to apply those standards. The union could not negotiate the level of performance required to achieve a particular rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal is nonnegotiable that flatly precludes management from adopting certain criteria into performance standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 56 FLRA 1115, 1119 (2001) (Proposal 3). Proposals that have the effect of locking standards into place are nonnegotiable. Proposals were rejected that sought to incorporate into a contract existing standards, for the effect of the proposal was to preclude management from exercising its right to change the standards during the life of the contract. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714, 734-37 (1987) (Proposal 7) (citing <span class="Italic">POPA and PTO</span>, 25 FLRA 384 (1987)). Proposals are not made negotiable because they mirror an established agency instruction or practice. <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Metal Trades Council and Dept. of Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 59, 63-64 (1990). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-079.html#sec6-80">Specific Instructions</a>," concerning proposals relating to specific work instructions.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NWSEA and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA</span>, 63 FLRA 450 (2009), was Provision 4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The customer service element of an employee's plan will reflect a combination of the identification of the employee's customers, who include but are not limited to colleagues, external entities, and members of the public, with a measure of the employee's responsiveness to the customers in the performance of the employee's official duties. "Responsiveness" means attention to customer needs or requests within an appropriate time frame.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA observed in <span class="Italic">NWSEA</span>, 63 FLRA at 453:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its terms, Provision 4 would require that the customer service element be composed of "a combination" of two factors: (1) "the identification of the employee's customers"; and (2) "a measure of the employee's responsiveness to the customers in the performance of the employee's official duties." Provision 4 would also require the Agency to define the term "customer" as "includ[ing] but...not limited to colleagues, external entities, and members of the public[.]" The provision would, therefore, require the Agency to base its assessment of employee performance with respect to the customer service element on the factors and definition listed in Provision 4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As argued by the Agency, the Authority has routinely held that the establishment of performance standards and elements constitutes an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Educ. Ass'n, Stateside Region,</span> 56 FLRA 473, 475 (2000) (<span class="Italic">FEA</span>) <span class="Italic">(</span>citing<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 1687,</span> 52 FLRA 521, 522-23 (1996)). It is also well established that proposals or provisions that restrict an agency's authority to determine the content of performance standards and elements affect the exercise of these rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 475. By failing to respond to the Agency's argument that Provision 4 affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work, the Union concedes that it does. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1226,</span> 62 FLRA at 460; <span class="Italic">NLRB,</span> 62 FLRA at 401-03; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1712,</span> 62 FLRA at 16-17. The Union does not assert that the provision is encompassed by any of the exceptions to management rights set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Accordingly, we find that Provision 4 is outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Distinguished from nonnegotiable proposals that substantively restrict management's development of standards are proposals requesting fair application of standards. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">UPTO and Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Walla Walla</span>, 44 FLRA 1145, 1152 (1992) (section of Proposal 2 was negotiable that solicited an agreement that the agency apply standards "fairly, equitably, objectively, and uniformly for like duties in like circumstances").</p>
