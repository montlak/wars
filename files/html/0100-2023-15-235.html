<p class="Body-Text">Willful misstatement of work experience on employment documents may warrant adverse action; both intent and inaccurate statements must be established. <span class="Italic">Coughlan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 230, 232-33 (1987). Misstatements of material items concerning the description of education, experience, and employment on an SF-171 warrant removal of an employee <span id="Page_2761"></span>in a position requiring trust and confidence. <span class="Italic">Webb v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 164, 166 (1981). The Board considers responses on the SF-171 based on the totality of circumstantial evidence. Demeanor of the appellant as a witness is but one circumstance to be evaluated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FitzGerald v. DHS</span>, 107 MSPR 666, 672-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16, 2008 MSPB 17 (2008) (setting aside arbitration award; the listing of educational accomplishments on an OF-612 was not false; there was no indication on the form, and contrary advice from the agency, as to whether only degrees from accredited schools could be listed); <span class="Italic">Guerrero v. VA</span>, 105 MSPR 617, 2007 MSPB 132 (2007) (application papers reflecting educational and other background contained errors that reflected haste or carelessness, but not intentional deception, in their preparation); <span class="Italic">Harmon v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 327, 332 (1994) (misstatement of educational credentials on a SF-171; reversing the AJ's findings favoring the appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intent to falsify a qualification statement may be inferred if there are a series of misstatements on different responses, each accruing to the benefit of the employee by enhancing qualifications for the position sought, with some errors rising to the level of reckless disregard for the truth. <span class="Italic">Shaw v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3034). In <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 492, 495-96 (1990), the appellant failed to list some past employment with the Postal Service in one section of an SF-171 that would have required him to show why he left the job, but mention was made the postal employment in other sections of the form. The Board concluded that the omission was intended to avoid showing that the appellant was removed for cause from the prior USPS position. His intent to falsify the form was not negated by mention on the SF-171 of that employment as to questions not calling for the circumstances of his termination from the position. Intent was found through omission of information about termination and an incorrect overlap of employment with another employer. The conclusion drawn was that the employee sought to avoid disclosure of employment with the employer by whom he was terminated. Subsequent disclosure of the information to an investigator did not detract from appellant's intent when he completed employment documents. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Forma v. DOJ</span>, 57 MSPR 97, 104-05 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Suarez v. DHUD</span>, 96 MSPR 213, 229 &#x00B6; 46 (2004) (inference of intentional concealment from the agency of a property interest involving a violation of agency regulations). A case determining that disclosure of information about past employment in the filing of a subsequent form will not necessarily exculpate its omission in a form submitted earlier is <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 52 MSPR 457, 463 (1992), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Reed v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 616, 621 (1997)<span class="Italic">. But see Naekel, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Misstatements do not always support discipline. An element of estoppel or condonation may be presented. An employee obtained a VRA appointment, then a competitive service appointment based on VRA service after he understated his education. The agency argued that this act was intended to avoid the statutory maximum education permitted for VRA applicants, but <span class="Italic">Perry v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 81, 86 (1987), concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant initially misrepresented his educational level to the agency, he has consistently maintained that his motive was to avoid appearing over-qualified to potential employers, not so that he could receive a VRA appointment. Further, appellant submitted to the agency the updated SF-171 indicating his true level of education in June 1983, while he was serving under the VRA appointment, but the agency took no action against appellant upon learning of this fact. On the contrary, the agency converted appellant to a competitive position and later promoted him within the competitive service. Then, in July 1985, two years after appellant gave notice to the agency of his true level of education, the agency took the removal action. We note also that appellant had completed his probationary period and that he had been performing satisfactorily in the competitive service for two years when the agency removed him. Accordingly, under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that the agency's action did not promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jakes v. Veterans Administration</span>, 793 F.2d 293, 295 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to academic credentials required for a position, <span class="Italic">Rathbun v. VA</span>, 293 Fed. Appx. 764, 765 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rathbun has made no showing that the agency misled him, nor that the agency was derelict in supplying him with the information he needed to make his choice. It is uncontested that Rathbun's doctoral degree lacks the necessary APA seal of approval. He was afforded ample opportunity to make his equivalency argument. The agency is entitled to select the job credential requirements it wishes, and its choice entails no appealable adverse action. The efficiency of the service is clearly advanced by employment of personnel who meet hiring requirements. That the agency allowed Rathbun to work in the higher grade for some time does not estop it from enforcing the hiring prerequisites when Rathbun's deficiency comes to its attention.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lack of candor or misrepresentations concerning academic credentials led to removal, despite a good record of service in the position, <span class="Italic">Ebron v. DHS</span>, 475 Fed. Appx. 752, 754-57 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ebron argues that there was not substantial evidence to support the Board's decision to uphold the charges of lack of candor and failure to provide honest and complete information. First, Ebron asserts that the Agency failed to demonstrate that Ebron knew in 2005 that St. Regis was not an accredited institution, and he contends that he did not know about St. Regis's lack of accreditation until 2010. Additionally, Ebron argues that he had the educational requirements for the position he initially applied for so he had "no reason, interest, or motive to lie about his education" and he "believed" that he "possessed a proper degree"; therefore, he argues, the charges of lack of candor and failure to provide honest and complete information are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board considered when Ebron learned that St. Regis was not an accredited institution: two witnesses testified that Ebron had admitted he knew St. Regis was not accredited in 2005, a third witness's testimony did not contradict their statements (she testified only that she "did not hear" Ebron make such a statement), and the Board held that Ebron's testimony to the contrary lacked credibility. The Board weighed Ebron's testimony and that of the other witnesses and concluded that the testimony supporting Ebron's position was less credible, finding that Ebron knew St. Regis was not accredited. "The determination of the credibility of the witnesses is within the discretion of the presiding official who heard their testimony and saw their demeanor." <span class="Italic">Griessenauer v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 754 F.2d 361, 364 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board's determination of witnesses credibility is "virtually unreviewable." <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Therefore, we will not reweigh the evidence; we accept the Board's finding that Ebron knew St. Regis was not accredited in 2005.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision to uphold the charge of lack of candor is supported by substantial evidence. The Board concluded that despite knowing that his St. Regis diploma did not meet the qualifications necessary for the jobs, Ebron repeatedly included it in his applications and represented that the information was accurate.[1] To establish lack of candor, the Board need not prove there was intent to deceive but only that a person failed "to disclose something that, in the circumstances, should have been disclosed in order to make the given statement accurate and complete." <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Given the Board's conclusion that Ebron knew his degree was inadequate, and given the requirement for the jobs is a four year degree from an accredited institution, there is substantial evidence to uphold the charge of lack of candor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In his 2006 application Ebron signed a statement saying:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, all of the information on and attached to this application is true, correct, complete and made in good faith. I understand that false or fraudulent information on or attached to this application may be grounds for not hiring me or for firing me after I begin work, and may be punishable by fine or imprisonment. I understand that any information I give may be investigated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board's decision to uphold the charge of failure to provide honest and complete information is supported by substantial evidence. Such a charge "may be sustained only if the agency proves by preponderant evidence that the employee knowingly made false statements with the intention of deceiving or defrauding the agency." <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, 607 (2001). "[A]n incorrect statement coupled with the lack of any credible explanation or contrary action by an employee has been held to constitute circumstantial evidence of intention to deceive." <span class="Italic">Stein v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 434, 439 (1993). Ebron wrote in a 2010 memo that he was unaware that St. Regis was not accredited until after being notified by the FLETC. The Agency found that this representation was misleading because it conflicted with other statements Ebron made, including in his application to the FLETC where he stated that this degree was not from an accredited college or university. The Board held that Ebron's "conduct demonstrates he mislead the [A]gency about such things as St. Regis' location and how he determined there were problems with St. Regis' accreditation...." The Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ebron contends that "[t]he [A]gency failed to demonstrate that it considered all relevant factors and exercised its discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness," in determining that removal was proper. For the most part, penalty "for employee misconduct is left to the agency's discretion"; therefore, this court's review is "highly deferential." <span class="Italic">Webster v. Dep't of Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1990). "While...the penalty must be reasonable in light of the sustained charges,...[reasonable in this context means] the agency's choice of penalty not be grossly disproportionate to the offense." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 686 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ebron has offered no argument why the penalty is "grossly disproportionate to the offense." The Agency considered "the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and its relation to the appellant's duties, position and responsibilities; whether the offense was intentional, for personal gain and repeated." <span class="Italic">Ebron</span>, 2011 M.S.P.B. LEXIS 2023, at *32; <span class="Italic">see Douglas v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981). The Agency concluded that Ebron "misrepresented his credentials even after he knew that his degree was not from an accredited institution...and his <span id="Page_2762"></span>lack of a bachelor's degree renders him ineligible to hold a warrant and he is therefore unable to perform the duties of his position." Furthermore, the Agency considered the negative impact the misconduct had on the agency's reputation and deemed Ebron had no potential for rehabilitation given his continued receipt of benefits, including promotions he knew he was unqualified for, "while failing to provide accurate and honest information to agency representatives." Moreover, despite mitigating factors, like having no prior disciplinary history, the Agency held that the seriousness of the misconduct warranted removal. The Board determination was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ebron argues that the Agency erred in disciplining him because it "failed to demonstrate that [his] removal supports the efficiency of service." Ebron contends that because he did a "successful job" and was "a valuable asset and service to the Agency" the agency "failed to establish the requisite nexus between Ebron's misconduct and the efficiency of service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may discipline an employee "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), after demonstrating a "nexus" between the employee's misconduct and "an adverse effect upon the agency's functioning," <span class="Italic">Mings v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 813 F.2d 384, 389-90 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We "apply a deferential review to determinations by the [B]oard as to whether such a nexus has been shown." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 229 F.3d 1356, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency concluded that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As early as January 2006, you knew your degree was not accredited; however you continued your employment with this Federal agency. During the fact finding process, you provided conflicting statements and inaccurate statements which demonstrate a lack of candor. Our confidence in your ability to perform your duties in an honest and ethical manner has been severely compromised. Agencies need the means to remove employees who have misrepresented their qualifications for employment. The public is not well-served by having federal employees who have obtained their credentials from diploma mills, continue in jobs for which they are not qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board stated that removal</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">promotes efficiency of the service when the grounds for the action relate to...employee's ability to accomplish his duties satisfactorily.&#8197;...Moreover an agency has a right to expect its workers to be honest, trustworthy, and candid. The appellant's lack of candor strikes at the very heart of the employer-employee relationship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Agency adequately showed Ebron's misconduct affected the trust and confidence the Agency could place in his job performance, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 135, 138 (2006), the Board's decision was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holders of public office are the servants of the people, and as such are held to high standards of honesty and candor. Ebron may have rationalized his conduct in his own mind, but there is substantial evidence that he knew in 2005 that his "degree" was from a diploma mill. His failure to timely reveal that information was dishonest. The Agency had good cause to fire him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">In re Spielman,</span> 1 MSPR 54, 60-61, 1 MSPB 50 (1979) (ALJ Decision) (individual who falsified an application for an administrative law judge position was suspended rather than removed because of the mitigating effects of an intervening excellent performance and presumed rehabilitation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The separation by considerable time between events investigated and the occurrence of the underlying events does not dispel the element of nexus in a charge of lack of candor involving statements in federal employment forms about past work history, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-15-0206-I-1 (NP 4/21/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also disputes the administrative judge's finding of nexus for the lack of candor charge because the charge stems from forms he completed years ago. We are not persuaded. <span class="Italic">See Harmon v. General Services Administration</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 327, 329, 334-35 (1994) (finding nexus where an employee falsified his application materials years earlier), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 47 F.3d 1181 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Ludlum v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 28 (2000) (finding that an agency has a right to expect its workers to be honest, trustworthy, and candid; a lack of candor strikes at the very heart of the employer-employee relationship), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 278 F.3d 1280, 1284 (Fed.
