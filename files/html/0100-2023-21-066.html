<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-66"><span class="space">k.</span> Post-Separation Medical Evidence</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Reilly v. OPM</span>, 571 F.3d 1372, 1376-83 (Fed. Cir. 2009), vacated a Board decision rejecting post-separation medical evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction to review disability determinations is quite limited. The Civil Service Retirement Act provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office [of Personnel Management] <span class="Italic">shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter</span>. Except to the extent provided under subsection (d) of this section [dealing with findings of mental disability], <span class="Italic">the decisions of the Office concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c) (emphasis added). Despite the seemingly unequivocal language of the statute, as the Supreme Court has stated, there is a strong presumption favoring judicial review that can only be rebutted "upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent." <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 778 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> the Supreme Court analyzed the language and history of &#x00A7; 8347. As the Court in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> noted, "&#x00A7; 8347(c) imposes 'a special and unusual restriction on judicial examination, and under it courts are not as free to review [agency] retirement decisions as they would be if the finality clause were not there.'" <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 780 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States,</span> 397 F.2d 295 (Ct. Cl. 1968)). However, the Court concluded that the statute did not entirely deprive our court of jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board on disability claims. The Court cited approvingly our predecessor court's decision in <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, 397 F.2d 295, which held that this court had jurisdiction to review whether there has been "'a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination'" but had no jurisdiction to review factual determinations. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 780-81 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins,</span> 397 F.2d at 297). The Supreme Court adopted this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result is that, under <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> and <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> we cannot review Board decisions for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 781-82. However, in the rare case where the petitioner alleges that the agency committed legal errors of sufficient gravity, we have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 790 n.26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> can be understood by examining the prior cases cited by the Supreme Court as applying the <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard, as well as more recent cases applying <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> after <span class="Italic">Lindahl.</span> These cases generally fall into either of two categories: first, there are cases holding that we cannot review issues related to evidentiary sufficiency or to minor legal errors. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gaines v. United States,</span> 158 Ct. Cl. 497, 501-503 (1962), relied on by the court in <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> and cited in <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> the court rejected "hyper-technical arguments that the [CSC] did not follow every jot and tittle of the applicable procedures," as well as challenges to weighing of medical evidence, as beyond the jurisdiction of the court. <span class="Italic">See also Davis v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 470 F.3d 1059, 1060-61 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (no jurisdiction over failure "to consider the totality of the evidence" or specific evidentiary rulings within the discretion of the Board); <span class="Italic">Brenneman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 439 F.3d 1325, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (rejecting argument that the Board "failed to consider" certain evidence); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Office of Pers.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> and <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> was most recently addressed by this court in <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 508 F.3d 1034 (Fed. Cir. 2007). We described the scope of our review, concluding that "we may only address the critical legal errors, if any, committed by the [Board] in reviewing OPM's decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1039.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> the appellant sought to establish her psychological disability by submitting, among other things, letters and medical reports from her doctors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1036-38. Her doctors' reports were based primarily on the doctors' consultations with the petitioner, and relied on the petitioner's own description of her psychological symptoms.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In denying her claim for disability, OPM and the Board gave no weight to the medical evidence because the appellant failed to submit any "objective" medical evidence "such as emergency room reports showing incidents of panic attack...[and] relevant psychiatric studies or test results." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1039-40. According to OPM, the doctors' opinions were entitled to no weight because the doctor "provided no details concerning any mental status evaluation," and "does not provide copies of any formal cognitive testing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Before the Board, the AJ noted that the medical evidence relied on the appellant's account of her symptoms, and stated that "the evidence presented by Dr. Nichols is only as good as the information given to her by [the appellant] ," and that evidence based on appellant's "subjective narrative" would not be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We rejected the distinction drawn by the Board and OPM between objective evidence of the appellant's condition and subjective, i.e. self-reported, evidence of the appellant's condition. We noted that the doctor's reports inherently involved a determination by the doctor that the appellant's "account of these symptoms is credible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1042. We <span id="Page_4178"></span>held that under general evidentiary rules there was no basis for rejecting such "subjective" medical evidence as irrelevant, and that this legal error went to the heart of the administrative determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1043-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting the Board's decision, we cautioned that the court "must be discerning and cannot be satisfied by opinions that invoke the trappings of factual analysis--<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., by vaguely describing broad swaths of evidence as 'insufficient' or as failing to carry the claimants burden, or simply asserting that all record evidence was considered." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1040.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen read closely and carefully, [the Board's decision] reveal[s] that absolutely no weight was given to certain evidence solely because it cannot generally be classified as "objective" and not because of any specific identifiable defect.... <span class="Italic">Disqualification of evidence because of its type is an imposition of a legal standard because it inherently imposes a categorical requirement</span>. When the use of such a standard is dispositive of disability retirement claims, they go to the heart of the administrative determination, <span class="Italic">and we are charged with resolving whether the imposed standard and its inherent evidentiary requirement are lawful</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these standards, we first consider Reilly's argument that the Board "act[ed] arbitrarily and capriciously in conducting a legally insufficient factual analysis" by failing to consider particular items of evidence. For support, Reilly relies primarily on the fact that this evidence was not explicitly mentioned in the Board's decision. We conclude that this claim is beyond our jurisdiction to review. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, arguments relating to whether "the Board improperly failed to consider the totality of the evidence...are, in reality, challenges to the factual underpinnings of the Board's determination. Under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, we cannot entertain these arguments." 470 F.3d at 1060-61.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, Reilly's argument that the Board categorically rejected all uncorroborated lay evidence is of the type that, if established, likely would be within our jurisdiction to review. Under <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, we have jurisdiction to determine whether the Board gave no weight to evidence pursuant to a legal "error going to the heart of the administrative determination" or "a substantial departure from important procedural rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Reilly urges that the Board erred in categorically holding that post-resignation evidence of the applicant's condition should not be considered. The government conceded at oral argument that, if the Board had adopted such a categorical legal rule, it would be unlawful and within our jurisdiction to reverse. However, the government urges that the Board did not adopt such a rule. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, we do not read the Board as suggesting that all medical opinions rendered post-retirement are inadmissible; indeed, the Board relied on the opinion of OPM's own expert medical doctor rendered post-retirement. What we understand the Board to be holding is that medical opinions rendered post-retirement are admissible only if they are based on pre-retirement tests, observations, interviews, and medical examinations, and address the employee's pre-retirement condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board clearly adopted a rule that post-resignation medical evidence is categorically irrelevant, and that it was legal error for the AJ to rely on such evidence. After very briefly reciting the post-resignation medical evidence, the Board stated that "[b]ecause all of this evidence post-dates the appellant's resignation, and does not address her condition at the time of her resignation, to the extent that the AJ relied on it to determine that the appellant was disabled, this was error." <span class="Italic">Reilly,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. at 364. The Board repeated this categorical exclusion in addressing the letter of August 2006 by the pulmonary specialist. The Board stated that "this letter post-dates the appellant's...resignation, and does not address her condition at the time of her resignation. We therefore do not find it persuasive on the issue of whether the appellant was disabled when she resigned." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 364-65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board made no mention of how much (or how little) time had elapsed after resignation, nor addressed why, on these particular facts, evidence of the appellant's medical condition a few months after resignation was of no value in establishing the appellant's medical condition at the time of resignation. Instead, the Board categorically held that it is legal error to consider any evidence that is noncontemporaneous and does not explicitly refer back to the condition at the time of resignation. A subsequent decision of the Board supports this interpretation. In <span class="Italic">Luzi v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 79, 84 (2008), the Board cited Reilly as support for declining to consider any evidence that "post-dates the appellant's...separation, and does not address his condition [before separation]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated previously, the government does not defend this rule. We cannot see any basis for such a rule which contradicts the general rule that "OPM [and the Board] must consider all of an applicant's competent medical evidence." <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> 508 F.3d at 1041.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that such evidence may be considered under general evidentiary principles. "Although the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply to Board hearings, they are a helpful guide to proper hearing practices." <span class="Italic">Yanopoulos v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 796 F.2d 468, 471 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citation omitted). The rule is that "[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by [the Rules or other law]." Fed. R. Evid. 402; Unif. R. Evid. 402. Under the Uniform Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Evidence, "'Relevant evidence' means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Fed. R. Evid. 401; Unif. R. Evid. 401. "The provisions that all relevant evidence is admissible...are 'a presupposition involved in the very conception of a rational system of evidence.'" Advisory Committee Notes to Fed. R. Evid. 402 (quoting Thayer, <span class="Italic">Preliminary Treatise on Evidence</span> 264 (1898)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it is established that "the tests of relevancy...are of the same general nature for retrospectant [sic] evidentiary facts." <span class="Italic">Wigmore on Evidence,</span> &#x00A7; 148 (4th ed. 1983). "[P]assage of time alone is insufficient to support an objection of remoteness." 31A C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 295 (2008). Remoteness is only established where the passage of time "undermin[es otherwise] reasonable inferences due to the likelihood of supervening factors." 1 <span class="Italic">McCormick on Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 185 (6th ed. 2006). The field of forensic medicine abounds with examples of subsequent medical examinations relevant to a prior condition. As a classic example, inferences about prior intoxication can be drawn from blood alcohol tests conducted at a later time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 <span class="Italic">McCormick on Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 205 (6th ed. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, although the regulatory scheme and standard on review are different in Social Security cases, the reasoning of these cases also provides support for the general principle that later medical evidence can be relevant. As the Fifth Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Ivy v. Sullivan,</span> "noncontemporaneous medical records are relevant to the determination of whether onset occurred on the date alleged by the claimant.... Subsequent medical evidence is relevant because it may bear upon the severity of the claimant's condition before the expiration of his or her insured status." 898 F.2d 1045, 1049 (5th Cir. 1990) (citations and quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Basinger v. Heckler,</span> 725 F.2d 1166, 1169 (8th Cir. 1984). As stated by the Second Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have observed, repeatedly, that evidence bearing upon an applicant's condition subsequent to the date upon which the earning requirement was last met is pertinent evidence in that it may disclose the severity and continuity of impairments existing before the earning requirement date or may identify additional impairments which could reasonably be presumed to have been present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Pollard v. Halter,</span> 377 F.3d 183, 193-94 (2d Cir. 2004) (alterations omitted). Medical examinations identifying a disability are always retrospectant [sic] in some sense; as the Ninth Circuit observed, "[i]t is obvious that medical reports are inevitably rendered retrospectively and should not be disregarded solely on that basis." <span class="Italic">Smith v. Bowen,</span> 849 F.2d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in military retirement cases this court's predecessor has held that subsequent medical evidence can be highly relevant to determining the prior medical condition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jordan v. United States,</span> 205 Ct. Cl. 65 (1974) (stressing "the importance...of considering the applicant's medical condition <span class="Italic">subsequent</span> to his discharge, and the professional evaluation and treatment thereof, in its determination of fitness for duty as of the date of discharge");<span class="Italic"> Beckham v. United States,</span> 392 F.2d 619, 625-26 (Ct. Cl. 1968) ("[w]e must look to manifestations of the disease or ailment appearing both before and after the point in time of separation" to determine fitness at the time of separation); <span class="Italic">see also Farrar v. United States,</span> 358 F.2d 965 (Ct. Cl. 1965).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the OPM regulations contradicts these general principles or specifies that the medical examination or documentation must have occurred prior to retirement. In fact, the regulations permit filing an application within one year after separation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1204, and explicitly countenance taking additional medical examinations during the pendency of the application to assist OPM in making a decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206(c). OPM's standard form for doctor statements is also written in the present tense, and includes no question specifically asking what the applicant's medical condition was at the time of her separation from service. OPM Standard Form 2824C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board erred in adopting a categorical rule barring consideration of post-retirement evidence. Where proximity in time, lay testimony, or some other evidence provides the requisite link to the relevant period the subsequent medical evidence can be very probative of a prior disability. This is not to say that a later medical condition will always be relevant or entitled to substantial weight. There are circumstances where such evidence is irrelevant or entitled to little weight as a factual matter, such as where the later medical condition is attributable to some incident that occurred after the period in question, <span id="Page_4179"></span>or where there is a substantial lapse of time and a lack of evidence connecting the prior condition to the more recent medical evidence. However, it is equally clear that evidence of a later medical condition will not always be irrelevant. Here, for example, the specialist's examinations occurred within a few months of Reilly's retirement, and there was no suggestion of any event that would have caused Reilly's condition to deteriorate at an unusual rate. Also, lay testimony might establish the same symptoms and severity before retirement as was observed after retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board erred in categorically excluding post-resignation evidence. As in <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> this legal error is a substantial departure from important procedural rights and goes to the heart of the administrative determination. 508 F.3d at 1043-44. Thus, this case must be remanded to the Board for further consideration based on the appropriate legal standard.</p>

OPM</span>, DA-844E-20-0190-I-1 (NP 12/16/2022) ("[T]he appellant's lay testimony clearly established that he endured the same symptoms and level of severity before his resignation as observed after resignation....nothing in OPM's regulations specifies that medical examinations or documents that explain them must predate the applicant's retirement or resignation"); <span class="Italic">Wall v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 188, 190-91 &#x00B6; 5, 2010 MSPB 178 (2010) ("The Federal Circuit held in<span class="Italic"> Reilly</span> that post-separation evidence of an appellant's medical condition may be considered in determining eligibility for a disability retirement annuity. 571 F.3d at 1380-81.

The court stated that the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Reilly</span> 'contradicts the general rule that "OPM [and the Board] must consider all of an applicant's competent medical evidence."'<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1381 <span class="Italic">(</span>citing<span class="Italic"> Vanieken-Ryals v.
