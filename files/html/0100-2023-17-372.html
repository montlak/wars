<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-370"><span class="space">e.</span> Harassment; Hostile Environment</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although harassment may be the subject of an EEO complaint, it may also be grieved. FLRA examined the nature of sexual harassment and approved remedies that included training for supervisors, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 48 FLRA 74, 82-90 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span>, "hostile environment" sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII. <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span>, 477 U.S. at 65. For sexual harassment based on a hostile working environment to be actionable under Title VII, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the employee's conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 67. Moreover, the conduct or advances complained of must be unwelcome. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 68. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Schlei &#x0026; Grossman, <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination Law</span> Ch. 12, at 152-53 (David A. Cathcart <span class="Italic">et al.</span> eds, 2d ed. Cum. Supp. 1989). An employer is liable for the acts of a supervisor "'where the [employer] knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action.'" <span class="Italic">Andrews v. City of Philadelphia</span>, 895 F.2d 1469, 1486 (3d Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">Andrews</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc.</span>, 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir. 1989)). If an employee establishes the above factors, an employer "may rebut the [employee's] case by producing evidence that the conduct did not occur, or that it was genuinely 'trivial' in nature or was an isolated incident, or that the [employee] did not indicate that the conduct was unwelcome (or, conversely, that the [employee's] conduct demonstrated that the behavior was welcome)." <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination Law</span> at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator applied EEOC's regulations on sexual harassment, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span>, and decisions of other Federal courts in concluding that the grievant had been subjected to sexual harassment in violation of Title VII. The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator "misapplied the elements and standards of proof from [<span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span>]." According to the Agency, the Arbitrator improperly ruled that a hostile environment existed because "the [g]rievant denied[,] and the [A]rbitrator did not find, that any sexual type of conduct created the hostile environment." The Agency notes that when the Agency's representative asked the grievant if her first or second-line supervisor "ever made any unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature," the grievant responded, "No."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's argument, several Federal circuit courts have stated that harassment may constitute sex discrimination even if the offending conduct or language is not sexual in nature. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Andrews</span>, 895 F.2d at 1485 (where the court stated that to establish a sexually hostile working environment "the offensive conduct is not necessarily required to include sexual overtones" and that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span> "in no way limited th[e] concept [of sexual harassment] to intimidation or ridicule of an explicitly sexual nature"); <span class="Italic">Hall v. Gus Construction Co.</span>, 842 F.2d 1010, 1014 (8th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Hall</span>) (the court agreed with the rationale of other courts that harassment does not have to be sexual in nature because "[i]ntimidation and hostility toward women because they are women can obviously result from conduct other than explicit sexual advances"); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co.</span>, 833 F.2d 1406, 1415 (10th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Hicks</span>) (where the court rejected the view that the acts underlying a sexual harassment claim had to be clearly sexual in nature). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dole</span>, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">McKinney</span>) (where the court stated that it has "never held that sexual harassment or other unequal treatment of an employee...that occurs because of the sex of the employee must, to be illegal under Title VII, take the form of sexual advances or of other incidents with clearly sexual overtones").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator improperly relied on conduct that was not clearly of a sexual nature to conclude that the grievant established the existence of a hostile working environment constitutes mere disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator improperly applied <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span>. In particular, we note that the Arbitrator relied on the following findings to conclude that sexual harassment occurred and that it was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the grievant's conditions of employment and create a hostile or abusive working environment. As found by the Arbitrator, foul, vulgar language and comments were typically used around the grievant in the workplace and on one or more occasions, her first-line supervisor "called her a 'stupid bitch' in front of her (male) coworkers and also told her...to 'get your ass back to the (Phase) Dock.'" Further, the Arbitrator found that the first-line supervisor: (1) had a "condescending attitude" toward the grievant and would admonish her on her work in front of the grievant's male coworkers "so as to purposefully embarrass" the grievant; (2) required the grievant to "'account for her every moment'" while not requiring the same accountability of the male coworkers; (3) sent someone to interrupt the grievant while she was on a break and to instruct her to return to work while allowing the male coworkers to "return to work in a natural manner at the end of their [b]reak[s]"; (4) required the grievant to strictly account for her leave usage without requiring the male coworkers to do the same; (5) "[b]elittl[ed,]" "[d]egrad[ed,]" and "[c]riticiz[ed]" the grievant and her work in front of the male coworkers "so as to make an example of" the grievant; and (6) made other employees talking to the grievant "run[&#8197;] off" but did not make them do so when they were talking to the male coworkers. Further, based on the Arbitrator's findings as a whole, including his finding of prior complaints by the grievant, we conclude that the Arbitrator implicitly determined that the conduct was unwelcome. Moreover, as found by the Arbitrator, management was clearly aware of the grievant's complaints of sexual harassment and failed to investigate them or otherwise act to end the harassment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator's findings in this case support his conclusion that the grievant was subjected to a hostile working environment under <span class="Italic">Meritor Savings Bank</span> and its progeny and that the Agency did not rebut those findings....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the remedy, the Arbitrator ordered the first and second-line supervisors to attend, on a regular basis, "training workshops/seminars, etc. on [s]exual [h]arassment for the purpose of being/becoming informed as to what their [l]egal [o]bligations are, as [Agency] representatives[, on] this extremely important [i]ssue." The Agency argues that this portion of the remedy directly interferes with, and abrogates, management's rights to discipline and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies....&#8197;We find that the Agency's exception to the portion of the remedy requiring the first and second-line supervisors to attend workshops or seminars on sexual harassment constitutes disagreement with the Arbitrator's fashioning of the remedy and provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reach the same result with respect to the Agency's argument that this portion of the remedy directly interferes with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute because that right encompasses only the right to discipline "employees," and section 7103(a)(2) of the Statute expressly excludes supervisors from the definition of "employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, 39 FLRA at 1298.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further reject the Agency's argument that this portion of the remedy directly interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The Agency argues that under the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">BLM, Boise District Office</span>, management's right to assign work encompasses any training assignments, including sexual harassment training. However, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3407 and U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Mapping Agency, Hydrographic-Topographic, Washington, D.C.</span>, 39 FLRA 557, 567 (1991) (<span class="Italic">DMA</span>), the Authority specifically stated that it would no longer follow <span class="Italic">BLM, Boise District Office</span> to the extent that that case indicated that all proposals requiring agencies to conduct sessions intended to convey information would be treated as training proposals. Rather, in <span class="Italic">DMA</span> the Authority found that proposals merely requiring an agency to provide information that concerned conditions of employment and was otherwise disclosable did not concern the assignment of training. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 563....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As part of the remedy, the Arbitrator ordered that "ANY/ALL future job/work assignments while the [g]rievant...works for i.e., remains under the supervision of [the Phase Dock Maintenance Crew Supervisor] AND [the Aircraft Production Supervisor] will be subject to the approval of higher[-]level Management." The Agency contends that this portion of the remedy directly interferes with, and abrogates, management's rights to assign employees and work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2385"></span>Management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what position the duties will be assigned....&#8197;Proposals that require an agency to assign particular tasks to particular individuals, or preclude management from assigning particular functions to particular individuals, directly interfere with management's right to assign work....&#8197;This portion of the remedy requires that before the grievant's first or second-line supervisors may exercise management's right to assign a particular task to the grievant, such assignment must be approved by higher-level management. By requiring that any and all future job and work assignments made to the grievant by her first and second-line supervisors be subject to the approval of higher-level management, this portion of the remedy precludes the first and second-line supervisors from assigning tasks unless a stated condition is met and thereby directly interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as this portion of the remedy directly interferes with management's right to assign work, we conclude that the portion of the remedy requiring that any and all future job and work assignments made to the grievant by her first and second-line supervisors be subject to the approval of higher-level management is contrary to law. Consequently, we will modify the award to set aside that portion of the remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">To constitute actionable harassment, the actions of management must meet a threshhold level, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chapter 52</span>, 70 FLRA 680, 684 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the only remaining determinations supporting the conclusion that the Agency violated Title VII are that: (1) without evaluating the grievant's work, the grievant's third-level manager told his subordinates that he did not want the grievant to receive an outstanding performance rating; (2) Agency witnesses testified that the grievant did not perform sufficient observable work to receive a performance rating, but those officials were not aware of the work that the grievant performed; (3) the grievant did not receive the contractually required mid-year performance review or written explanation for her not-ratable annual appraisal; and (4) the Agency's grievance denials did not address the Union's discrimination and reprisal allegations. Arbitrator Helburn faulted the Agency for these instances of "[b]usiness as usual [that] became neglect," and he posited that such treatment proved "discrimination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that these four examples were not sufficiently "materially adverse" that they "might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination."[43] Even if the circumstances were personally unpleasant to the grievant, they are more akin to "annoyances that often take place at work and that all employees" experience.[44] Moreover, they were not sufficiently severe or pervasive that a reasonable person would find them "objectively" so "hostile or abusive" that they altered the conditions of the grievant's employment.[45] Consequently, these examples do not adequately support the Arbitrator's reprisal or hostile-work-environment findings.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that paragraphs 3.c and d. are contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute because they excessively interfere with management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statue. The Agency contends that these paragraphs preclude the supervisor from supervising the grievant at all or from even approaching within ten feet of her or from speaking to her except with regard to work-related matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception challenges the award's consistency with law. Therefore, the Authority reviews the question of law raised by the exception and the Arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437, </span>53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency asserts that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Small Business Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). The Authority has held that precluding a supervisor from performing certain duties affects management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1051 (2001). As the award precludes the supervisor from supervising the grievant, the award affects management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an award affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106, the Authority assesses the legality of the award under a test that was developed in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). The two-prong <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II<span class="Italic"> </span>of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority considers<span class="Italic"> </span>whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, then the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Boston Region (Region 1), Lowell Dist. Office, Lowell, Mass., </span>57 FLRA 264, 268-69 (2001) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part)<span class="Italic"> (SSA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In<span class="Italic"> SSA, t</span>he arbitrator found that the agency failed to treat the grievant with dignity, courtesy, and respect, as required by the parties' agreement, and ordered the agency to reassign the grievant to a different supervisor. The Authority found that the remedy was deficient because it failed to satisfy prong II<span class="Italic"> of BEP</span>. As to the requirement of reconstruction, the Authority stated that while it may be difficult in some cases to construct meaningful remedies, this fact does not render the reconstruction prong of<span class="Italic"> BEP </span>inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See SSA,</span> 57 FLRA at 269. The Authority determined that the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> requirements are "rooted squarely" in <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>where the Supreme Court held that the only limitations on management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute are those contained within &#x00A7; 7106 itself. <span class="Italic">Id. T</span>he Authority further stated that in cases where an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute, "determining that [the] provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) cannot end the inquiry." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority explained that reconstruction is necessary to ensure that an agency's &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights are limited only to the extent to which the parties bargained. Accordingly, the Authority determined that "[r]egardless of whether allowing arbitrators to impose additional, different limitations on management's rights would be good policy, under<span class="Italic"> IRS, </span>it is not good law." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 270.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found, in pertinent part, that the Agency violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act because the supervisor had engaged in acts of sexual harassment against the grievant, and ordered that the supervisor not supervise the grievant under any circumstances, that he remain more than ten feet from her at all times, and that he not speak to her except with regard to work-related matters. The Agency contends that these remedies are deficient under prong II of<span class="Italic"> BEP </span>because they do not constitute a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated Title VII. The Agency does not contend that the remedies are not provided for by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, nor does it contest the Arbitrator's findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>it is clear, as the Agency contends, that these remedies do not constitute a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated Title VII. However, there is a fundamental difference between <span class="Italic">SSA </span>and the instant case. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, like <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, involved an award of a remedy for a purely contractual violation, whereas the instant case involves, as relevant here, an award of a remedy for a violation of applicable law--namely, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, this case appears to be the first since the issuance of <span class="Italic">BEP </span>in which an agency has specifically challenged, under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>a remedy provided for by an applicable law. For the following reasons, we hold that when an arbitrator issues a remedy for a violation of an applicable law such as Title VII, which provides for a remedy that affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, it is not appropriate to apply prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> to assess whether the remedy is legal. Rather, the appropriate inquiry is whether the remedy is provided for by the relevant applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to<span class="Italic"> BEP, </span>the Authority did not apply a reconstruction requirement. Instead, the Authority's approach to an arbitrator's enforcement of applicable law in relation to the exercise of management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) was to permit the arbitrator's remedy if the ordered actions were provided by the applicable law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Aeronautics and Space Admin., Lewis Research Ctr., </span>17 FLRA 966 (1985) (the Authority denied exceptions to an arbitrator's remedy which required the agency to <span id="page_2386"></span>reinstate a grievant's duties after the agency's removal of those duties had been found to constitute a statutory prohibited personnel practice);<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of Labor, Washington, D.C., </span>16 FLRA 1075, 1076 (1984) (the award "in effect is no more than a restatement of that which the Agency must do under governing law and regulation").</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">BEP, </span>and cases following it, such as<span class="Italic"> SSA, </span>did not address applicable law, but rather only contract provisions and the need to ensure that management rights "are limited only to the extent the parties bargained for." <span class="Italic">SSA, 5</span>7 FLRA at 270. Enforcing remedies provided for by applicable law does not raise the issue of whether a contractually-based remedy was agreed to by the parties under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Allowing arbitrators to order remedies that are provided for under employment discrimination laws is fully consistent with the Statute and the counsel of <span class="Italic">IRS "</span>that only constraints arising<span class="Italic"> </span>under &#x00A7; 7106 itself (through applicable laws or subsection (b)) are permissible." <span class="Italic">Id. at 269.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, insofar as SSA can be read as holding that prong II of BEP must be applied in all cases where an arbitrator's remedy affects a management right, we modify<span class="Italic"> SSA</span>. An arbitrator may lawfully award a remedy directing relief that is provided for by Title VII, irrespective of whether such a remedy affects a management right but fails to reflect reconstruction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, Title VII provides for victims of discrimination to receive "corrective, curative or preventive action...or measures adopted, to ensure that violations of the law similar to those found will not<span class="Italic"> </span>recur[.]" 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.501(a)(2). The remedies provided under this entitlement are the types of remedies at issue in this case. These remedies by their very nature would never reflect a reconstruction of what an agency would have done had the agency not violated Title VII. Had an agency not engaged in discrimination it never would (and wouldn't have the need to) provide an employee with any "corrective, curative or preventive action...or measures adopted, to ensure that violations of the law similar to those found will not recur[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, under<span class="Italic"> </span>EEOC Compliance Guidelines and case law, employers are "required under Title VII to intervene promptly and effectively to put an end to workplace sexual harassment." <span class="Italic">Intlekofer v. Turnage, </span>973 F.2d 773, 778 (9th Cir. 1992)<span class="Italic"> (Intlekofer);</span> EEOC Regulation, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1604.11(f) (an employer should take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring). Also, "remedial measures should not adversely affect the complainant. Thus, for example, if it is necessary to separate the parties, then the harasser should be transferred unless the complainant prefers otherwise." EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Vicarious Employer Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors, Section V:B.1(f). <span class="Italic">See also, Ellison v. Brady, </span>924 F.2d 872, 883 (9th Cir. 1991)<span class="Italic"> (Ellison) </span>(to avoid liability under Title VII for failing to remedy a hostile working environment, employers may even have to remove harasser from the workplace if mere presence would render the working environment hostile); [3] <span class="Italic">Intlekofer</span>, 973 F.2d at 781 (court found that in the circumstances presented the Veterans Administration's formal separation of the harasser from the complainant was insufficient remedy under Title VII).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In<span class="Italic"> Ellison, </span>the court further noted that it did "not think that [in determining the remedy] the appropriate inquiry is what a reasonable employer would do to remedy the sexual harassment. [Cite omitted]. Although employers are statutorily obligated to provide a workplace free from sexual harassment, they may be reluctant, for business reasons, to punish high ranking and highly productive employees for sexual harassment. In addition, asking what a reasonable employer would do runs the risk of reinforcing any prevailing level of discrimination by employers and fails to focus directly on the best way to eliminate sexual harassment from the workplace." <span class="Italic">Ellison, 924 F.2d at 882 n.17.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">A</span>s these cases reflect, Title VII, an applicable law, provides for the challenged remedies on a finding of sexual harassment in violation of Title VII. The Arbitrator ordered, among other things, that the supervisor not supervise the grievant, and that the supervisor remain at least 10 feet from the grievant at all times and not speak to her except concerning work related matters. The Arbitrator's remedy is based on evidence in the record showing action taken by the Agency to address the supervisor's sexual harassment of the grievant before the Arbitrator determined that such conduct constituted a violation of Title VII. Accordingly, we find that the contested remedies are not contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Intlekofer, 973 F.2d at 780 </span>(initial remedy involved separating the harasser and the victim so that they did not work the same shifts or run into another at the change of shifts and requiring them to avoid each other except as necessary for agency work).</p>
