<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-212"><span class="space">f.</span> Agreement to Provide Affirmative, Neutral, or Controlled Reference</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Many settlements control references through provisions describing who will <span id="Page_5094"></span>give a reference and what will be said. If there is no restriction concerning references in the settlement, the Board will not likely entertain allegations that the agency disparaged the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bales v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 187, 190 (1992) ("Appellant's contentions of slander, libel and retaliation are outside the scope of the Board's jurisdiction in this case because they do not relate to any provisions of the settlement agreement."). [Refer later in this chapter to <a href="0100-2023-23-215.html#sec16-213">"'Clean Record' or 'Clean Paper'; Expungement or Withdrawal of Record; Implicit Requirement; NDAA; Executive Order 13,839; Executive Order 14,003</a>"; review <span class="Italic">Clean Record Settlement Agreements and the Law</span> (MSPB Office of Policy and Evaluation 2013).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Federal Circuit criticized neutral or affirmative reference provisions in settlements, at least to the extent that they require misrepresentation of the true state of affairs (however that might be determined), the agreements are enforced. The Board's reviewing court observed in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628, 630-33 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The neutral reference requirement was spelled out in paragraph 8 of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8.&#x2003;The neutral reference shall include but not be limited to date hired, position as Police Officer GS-5, history of fully satisfactory performance ratings, letters of appreciation received dated Jan. 2, 1986 and August 15, 1986, and present status of leave without pay for personal reasons as of July 24, 1989. No negative information shall be disclosed. It is understood by the parties that the Agency will issue a fully satisfactory performance rating for 1988-1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After leaving the VA, Holmes applied for a position as a Park Ranger with the National Park Service (Park Service). His name subsequently was removed from the list of persons eligible for the position, however. On May 7, 1993, Holmes filed a petition for enforcement with the Board. In it, he alleged that the VA had failed to comply with paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement by failing to give the Park Service a neutral reference with respect to his VA employment and that, as a result, the Park Service had removed his name from the list of those eligible for the Park Ranger position. In support of his petition, Holmes proffered a copy of a memorandum written by Stephen M. Sitarski of the Park Service. In the memorandum, Mr. Sitarski indicated that the Park Service had been unable to get a usable reference concerning Holmes from Ken McLean of the VA. As required by paragraph 7 of the settlement agreement, the VA had designated Mr. McLean as one of only two people authorized to give a neutral reference regarding Holmes's VA employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Holmes's principal contention on appeal is that the Board erred in failing to conclude, based upon the evidence before it, that the VA had breached the settlement agreement by not giving the Park Service the neutral reference required by paragraph 8 of the agreement. Holmes asks us to reverse the Board's decision or, alternatively, to remand the case for a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). A contract is breached if one of the parties fails to comply with a provision of the contract in a way that is material. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Whether the VA failed to comply with paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement turns on the factual question of what Mr. McLean said to Ms. Sturm about Holmes when she called him regarding the Park Ranger position. On that point, the evidence of record is in conflict.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certain evidence suggests that the VA did not comply with the requirements of paragraph 8. For example, the Sturm report does not list any of the specific items of information required to be disclosed by the VA as part of a neutral reference under the settlement agreement. In addition, the declarations filed by Holmes and his former attorney, Ms. Dietrich, support the contention that Mr. McLean's reference did not comply with paragraph 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other evidence, though, supports the argument that the VA did comply with the settlement agreement. For example, the Sturm report does not disclose that Mr. McLean provided any negative information about Holmes in his discussion with Ms. Sturm, while in his own affidavit, Mr. McLean recites the information he gave the Park Service and swears that "[n]o negative information was disclosed by me and my actions were in full compliance with the Settlement Agreement."[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The VA and Holmes are entitled to have the settlement agreement enforced in accordance with its terms. However, settlement agreements containing no negative information requirements like the one here put agency officials such as Mr. McLean in a difficult position. For example, what does such an official do if, after he or she gives a "neutral reference" about a former employee, the person requesting the reference says "Are you aware of any negative information regarding this person?." At that point, if such information exists, the official must either lie, breach the settlement agreement by telling the truth, or refuse to answer the question. None of these alternatives is very appealing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, there is conflicting evidence regarding the key issue before the Board--whether Mr. McLean provided a neutral reference to Ms. Sturm as required by paragraph 8 of the settlement agreement. Under these circumstances, the Board erred as a matter of law in ruling in the VA's favor after crediting the Sturm report as support for the McLean affidavit without taking into account all the evidence of record. Put another way, the Board erred by not undertaking the task of addressing and coming to grips with the conflicting evidence in the record, and then deciding the case after having done so. "[o]n balance, th[e] record presents a legitimate factual issue of whether there was a breach" of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. United States Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1149 (Fed. Cir. 1991). For the reason just stated, we hold that further Board proceedings are required in order to resolve this factual issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Holmes</span> Judge Plager added, in a concurring opinion, 58 F.3d at 633-34:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In footnote five, the court points out the broader difficulties raised by "neutral reference" settlement agreements. These agreements arise when an agency is unhappy about an employee's performance or conduct, and takes steps to discharge the employee. (The statute governing such steps calls it a "removal.") The employee resists. The dispute is settled by an agreement under which the employee agrees to resign rather than be fired, and the agency agrees not to reveal why it wished to remove the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such an agreement contains an inherent moral hazard. From the viewpoint of an employee, faced with the threat of such an adverse personnel action, a settlement agreement with a neutral reference requirement provides the opportunity for the employee to misrepresent to prospective employers his previous employment record. From the viewpoint of the current employer, the agreement requires the employer, when information about the employee's conduct on the job is sought, to deliberately withhold material information which it knows is necessary to an informed decision by a prospective employer, and thus to misrepresent the employee's employment record in important respects.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However denominated, a "neutral" reference under these circumstances is not an honest reference. It may serve as a subtle signal to knowledgeable prospective employers that there is some undisclosed problem, in which case the employee has been misled into believing he is getting something he is not. A less knowledgeable prospective employer, on the other hand, not privy to the subtle signal, will receive a deliberately misleading statement which, if relied upon, may cause the prospective employer to be misled to its detriment. Moreover, as the court's opinion notes in footnote five, an honest official of the current employer, called upon for a reference, and recognizing that possibility, is placed in an impossible position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is different from that in which an agency simply agrees not to volunteer information for which it is not asked. These neutral reference agreements require that, when asked, material information be withheld, and in many cases that the agency report fully satisfactory ratings. Whatever the legal implications may be for such agreements, based as they are on an agreement to engage in deliberate misrepresentation, their ethical status is highly questionable. Furthermore, the practice of one government agency palming off an unacceptable employee on another government agency by withholding material evidence concerning the employee's conduct hardly serves the public interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reasonable settlement of legitimate disputes is to be encouraged. There no doubt are personnel disputes in which an amicable resolution will require some degree of forgiveness. But honest compromise does not mean that fraudulent concealment to the detriment of third parties should be condoned. One need not condemn all settlement agreements that contain a neutral reference provision in order to have serious reservations about its use in cases in which what is contemplated is deliberate misrepresentation of the employee's record. In my view, agencies contemplating such agreements, and in particular their participating legal counsel, should consider carefully the implications of their conduct.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In addition to the applicability of relevant provisions of the Codes of Professional Responsibility, counsel may wish to consider Anthony T. Kronman, <span class="Italic">The Lost Lawyer: Failing Ideals of the Legal Profession</span> (Harvard Univ. Press 1993); Mary Ann Glendon, <span class="Italic">A</span> <span class="Italic">Nation Under Lawyers</span> (Farrar 1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Poett v. USDA</span>, 98 MSPR 628, 629-634 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-21 (2005), provides an example of the substantial liability of an agency that breached a settlement by failing to enforce a provision concerning the source and content of a job reference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and the agency settled the appellant's appeal of a 28-day suspension. Pursuant to that agreement, the appellant resigned and the agency purged references to the suspension from the appellant's Official Personnel Folder (OPF). The sixth clause of the agreement, which is at issue here, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The AGENCY agrees that inquiries or job references regarding the APPELLANT'S work performance, reason for resignation, or other <span id="Page_5095"></span>employment matters will be referred to the AGENCY Personnel Operations Branch in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Information provided in connection with such inquiries will be of a "neutral" nature, and limited to employment data reflected in the OPF and the Employee Performance Folder (Fully Successful rating).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently interviewed with Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Administration (OSHA) employee Janice Barrier for a position with OSHA. After interviewing the appellant, Ms. Barrier contacted the appellant's former supervisor at the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, Sydney Griffith. When the appellant contacted Ms. Barrier after the interview to inquire how his references "were holding up," Ms. Barrier answered that she did not wish to comment. <span class="Italic">Poett v. Merit System Protection Board</span>, 360 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The appellant then asked the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) to investigate his suspicion that he had been given a bad job reference by Ms. Griffith in retaliation for whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the record on the issue of material breach has not been fully developed and states that there are disputed issues of fact that require the administrative judge to make credibility determinations. The agency is incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that OSHA employee Barrier contacted the appellant's former supervisor, USDA employee Griffith, who said "no," in response to employee Barrier's question as to whether the appellant was Griffith's "best employee." Because both parties to the conversation confirmed the exchange, there is no issue of credibility to be resolved. Additionally, there is no question that Ms. Griffith was not a proper party to provide a response because she was not a member of the agency's personnel department as required by paragraph 6 of the agreement. Therefore, the issue to be resolved is a legal one, whether the communication by an improper party constituted a material breach of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Department of Justice</span>, 334 F.3d 1065, 1072 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (where facts are undisputed, determination of whether there has been material non-compliance with the terms of the contract is a question of law). Because the agency has pointed to no conflicting factual issues relevant to the issue of material breach, no further development of the record is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency disputes the administrative judge's finding that a material breach occurred, arguing that: 1) the appellant's former supervisor's comment should be viewed as "neutral"; 2) no harm occurred; and 3) the appellant had no concerns about non-disclosure, rather his real concern was about obtaining monetary compensation. The agency's arguments lack merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Ms. Griffith's comment, assuming without deciding that comments made by an unauthorized person would not alone constitute a material breach, the comment that the appellant was not his former supervisor's best employee constituted an assessment of the appellant's performance that could not be determined from his OPF or EPF, the only two approved sources of information to be used in responding to inquiries or job references. Further, contrary to the agency's argument, the comment does not represent a fact that could be derived from the EPF record showing appellant's mid-level rating of "fully successful" on a 5-tiered rating scale. The mere fact that the rating system provides for ratings of "outstanding" and "superior" does not indicate that other employees in the appellant's office received those ratings and that the appellant's "fully successful" rating placed him below such employees. Thus Ms. Griffith's comment may not be viewed as coming from the appellant's EPF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Godwin v. Department of Defense</span>, 228 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Godwin</span>, the Federal Circuit found no violation of a settlement agreement where an individual provided information in response to a job-related inquiry that was outside the response prescribed by the settlement agreement. In <span class="Italic">Godwin</span>, however, the settlement agreement was more narrowly drawn than the agreement here because it was directed only to comments made by a particular person or her designee. The agreement in this case provides that all inquiries or job references must be directed to the personnel department and specifies the type and source of the response that may be supplied. <span class="Italic">Compare Godwin</span>, 228 F.3d at 1334, with Initial Appeal, Tab 11. As in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the non-disclosure clause is part of the consideration for which the appellant bargained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., March 1, 1998, letter to John Mehl, CRF, Tab 3, Ex. 1 at 2 (appellant stated that he did not want to be "blackballed on job references"). Thus, a violation of the non-disclosure provision constitutes a material breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's assertion that the appellant suffered no adverse consequence because of the breach is irrelevant. An appellant need not show actual harm, such as a failure to obtain a position or other form of monetary loss, in order to establish a breach of a non-disclosure provision. <span class="Italic">See Thomas,</span> 124 F.3d at 1442; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206 &#x00B6; 11 (1998). The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Bables v. Department of the Army</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 171 (2000), does not, as the agency suggests, require a different result. <span class="Italic">Bables</span> held that absent any harm to the appellant caused by the agency's failure to purge documents and the agency's subsequent expungement of those documents, which were never disseminated, there was no corrective action that the Board might order to enforce the agreement or compensate for any temporary noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Bables</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. at &#x00B6; 20. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Bables</span> may not be interpreted to require a showing of actual harm in order to establish a material breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument that monetary compensation was the appellant's primary motive for the settlement agreement lacks merit. The fact that the appellant sought attorney fees in addition to a non-disclosure provision, does not indicate that the appellant was not bargaining for non-disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's real concern appears to be the difficulty of complying with the bargain to which it agreed in October 1995. The agency sets out at length the Federal Circuit's criticism of clean record and neutral reference type settlement agreements. While the agency is correct that the Federal Circuit has recognized the difficult position an agency may be placed in by entering into a clean record or non-disclosure agreement, the Court has also made clear that it will not allow an agency that has willingly entered into such an agreement to breach it without being held responsible. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 124 F.3d at 1442. Accordingly, the difficulty of compliance is not a defense to an allegation of breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that even if the Board finds that a material breach occurred, the remedy should be limited to either enforcement of the agreement or partial compensation from the time the alleged breach transpired. The agency, however, does not have the right to select the remedy. The choice of seeking enforcement or rescission of a settlement agreement belongs to the non-breaching party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Commerce</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 398 &#x00B6; 14 (2005). Because the appellant is the non-breaching party in this case, he has the right to elect the remedy and he has elected rescission. Further, the Board has held that limiting the appellant's remedy to enforcement in the case of breach of a non-disclosure clause would be of limited value because the breach cannot be fully cured. <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 59, 62 (1995). Thus rescission is the appropriate remedy in this case.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Rescission must be total as there is no remedy of partial rescission or partial enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Capps v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 381, 388 (2004). Thus, the agency's suggestion that it only be required to pay partial compensation because it was in compliance with the agreement until the breach in July 1999, may not be accepted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement terms will be inoperative when the settlement agreement is rescinded. <span class="Italic">Mullins</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 212. Therefore, the appellant's resignation will also be rescinded and he will be entitled to reinstatement in his position with USDA retroactive to the end of the 28-day suspension, which ended September 2, 1995.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Torres v. DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 482, 484, 486-88 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 10-13, 2009 MSPB 19 (2009), also involved a negative reference that led the Board to question the agency's compliance with a "clean paper" agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement provided, in pertinent part, that the appellant would withdraw his appeal and submit a written resignation on a Standard Form (SF) 52. In exchange, the agency agreed to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) to cancel the removal action against Appellant that was effective October 13, 2006;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) to initiate a personnel action indicating that Appellant resigned, effective October 13, 2006 for "Personal Reasons,"...as indicated on the Standard Form 52;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), our reviewing court addressed a settlement providing for a "clean record" and for confidentiality as to the terms of the agreement. The court held in that case that a clean record means one's personnel record is "returned to its former state." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1370. Further, even though the agreement at issue in Pagan did not address what sort of reference would be provided to a future potential employer, the court held that the agency "was required to act, in matters relating to [the appellant,] as if he had a 'clean record.'"<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1371-72. In <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the court considered an agreement that included no confidentiality clause with regard to its terms but that provided for resignation in lieu of removal and for support in obtaining disability <span id="Page_5096"></span>retirement. The court held that by agreeing to replace the SF-50 reflecting her removal with one showing resignation, her employer "promised that the only legal document recording the end of [her] employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating she resigned for personal reasons." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, the Board has held that a settlement calling for rescission of a removal and issuance of an SF-50 showing resignation also requires the agency to expunge removal-related documents from the employee's personnel file and not to disclose such documents to third parties, even though the settlement did not explicitly set forth these requirements. <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). The key concern in such cases is that the Board "see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 8 (citing Pagan, 170 F.3d at 1372). While "the Federal Circuit has recognized the difficult position an agency may be placed in by entering into a clean record or nondisclosure agreement, the Court has also made clear that it will not allow an agency that has willingly entered into such an agreement to breach it without being held responsible." <span class="Italic">Poett</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 19 (citing <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;As noted by the Board in <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> agencies are in a better position to understand the potential problems "clean record" agreements may create and to ensure that employees understand them and that agreements adequately address them. <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the settlement provided for cancellation of the appellant's removal action and effectively a clean record, i.e., replacement of the SF-50 showing his removal with one showing that he resigned and expungement of all references to the removal in his OPF We find that application of the principles in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span> and its progeny requires construing the agreement in a way that will provide the appellant with the benefits for which he bargained. Specifically, the agreement must be construed as requiring that the agency's communications with third parties reflect what the replacement SF-50 shows, i.e., that he resigned, and that it not disclose the circumstances of the removal. Under the agreement, the agency is required to act, in matters relating to the appellant, as if he had a clean record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1371. We therefore find that the AJ erred when she held that the agreement did not preclude agency officials from providing an investigator with information about the appellant's removal. Revealing such information in violation of the agreement would be a material breach of the agreement, which provided, in effect, that the appellant was to be given a clean record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At this time, however, the record does not establish whether such a breach occurred, and further development of the evidence is required. The appellant's allegations regarding the alleged breach are contained in an unsworn statement, and the agency has not met its obligation to provide relevant evidence responding to the allegation, i.e., showing either that it complied or there was good cause for noncompliance. Accordingly, we find that the appeal must be remanded to the AJ, who shall provide the parties with an opportunity to provide evidence and argument as to whether a breach occurred. The AJ shall hold a hearing if there is a genuine issue of fact material to the agency's alleged breach of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See Turner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has opined that, in the context of a settlement agreement rescinding an adverse action and expunging records related to that adverse action, to "rescind" is to "destroy" and "erase" the adverse action and the reasons for it from the appellant's "professional record" with the agency. <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d at 1376. In applying our reviewing court's precedential decisions regarding such agreements, also known as "clean record" agreements, we have construed the agreements to require the agency to expunge documents related to the adverse action from "all personnel records that are officially kept," and to not disclose such documents to third parties, even if the settlement agreement did not explicitly set forth these requirements. <span class="Italic">Torres v.

Thus, if an entry in the agency's electronic time and attendance record system, which is the agency's official time and attendance record, is a personnel record, the agency's failure to remove the original entry recording the appellant's suspension in her time and attendance records would constitute a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reentered the arena with another settlement in <span class="Italic">Godwin v. DOD</span>, 228 F.3d 1332, 1335-39 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The agreement called for a scripted reference, that is, the agreement defined both the individual who would be designated by the appellant to provide a reference and the exact terms of that reference. The designated official was to advise potential future employers that the appellant resigned for personal reasons and that she was rated at the highly successful level. The agreement precluded negative statements by the selected official. The agreement led to litigation when an official other than the individual designated in the agreement received a reference inquiry and provided some information that was positive as well as some information or innuendo that was negative. An additional problem arose when the designated official refused to go beyond the scripted responses to answer a broader range of inquiries from the prospective employer. The Federal Circuit found no violation of the literal terms of the settlement. The court again expressed cautionary words concerning settlements that involve employment references:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Godwin's final contention is that the agency violated paragraph 11 of the settlement agreement. Paragraph 10 of the agreement required Ms. Godwin to "direct any potential future employers seeking an employment reference" to Nancy Rusch, an agency attorney, or Ms. Rusch's designee. Paragraph 11, in turn, provided that in response to any request for references by any potential employers, Ms. Rusch or her designee would state that Ms. Godwin "resigned from the Agency for personal reasons, and that [she] was rated at the highly successful level."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Godwin asserts that the agency breached the mandates of paragraph 11 on two occasions. The first involved a prospective employer who sent a questionnaire to the agency containing 12 questions, including questions about Ms. Godwin's judgment and decisionmaking, and whether the agency would rehire her. Ms. Rusch returned the form without filling it out, but she attached a cover letter stating that Ms. Godwin had "left for personal reasons" and that she had "performed at a highly successful level." With respect to the form, Ms. Rusch stated that she could not answer specific questions regarding Ms. Godwin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second incident involved an inquiry that a prospective employer <span id="Page_5097"></span>made first to Ms. Godwin's former supervisor, Preston Mitchell, and then to Ms. Rusch. In response to a set of specific questions, Mr. Mitchell stated that Ms. Godwin exceeded standards in her observation of work hours, had an outgoing personality, and could secure important information on a case when others could not. When asked about her leave usage, Mr. Mitchell responded that Ms. Godwin "had an extended period of leave usage," which the administrative judge determined was true. With respect to most of the specific questions, however, the prospective employer reported that Mr. Mitchell declined to answer and instead laughed and "took the 5th." The prospective employer then contacted Ms. Rusch, who said that Ms. Godwin "met standards" with respect to her observation of work hours, the quality and quantity of her work, her interpersonal skills, and "accepting direction and accepting change." Ms. Rusch declined to answer several other questions, including whether the agency would rehire Ms. Godwin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that the agreement in this case was "not nearly as broad" as similar agreements in other cases. Paragraph 10 obligated Ms. Godwin to refer prospective employers to Ms. Rusch or her designee. Ms. Rusch, or her designee, "could only reveal the information agreed to in the settlement, without making any negative statements." The agreement contained no other restrictions and did not "address what information other employees could disclose at other times." In light of the limited nature of the obligations imposed by paragraph 11, the administrative judge found that neither Mr. Mitchell nor Ms. Rusch had breached the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have upheld the validity of settlement agreements of the general sort involved in this case, we have several times commented on the difficulties created by such agreements not to give negative recommendations regarding a former employee<span class="Italic">. See Pagan v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Settlement agreements that bind an agency to give a "neutral reference," as in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, or to represent that the employee had a "clean record," as in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, are particularly difficult to comply with: they bind the entire agency, and they make it necessary to decide whether a particular response, or refusal to respond, makes the reference not "neutral" or the employee's record appear not to be "clean." In <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, for example, this court held that the agency did not comply with its undertaking to represent that Mr. Pagan had a "clean record" when an agency representative crossed through portions of a questionnaire that asked for Mr. Pagan to be ranked according to attendance, work performance, behavior and attitude<span class="Italic">. See Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1373.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement in this case, however, is narrower than those in the cases on which Ms. Godwin relies. In this case, unlike in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> and <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, the agreement was directed only to comments made by Ms. Rusch and her designee. Paragraph 10 required Ms. Godwin to refer prospective employers to Ms. Rusch or her designee for an employment reference, and paragraph 11 set forth the terms of what Ms. Rusch or her designee could say in response to such an inquiry. The agency was thus protected against the risk that a prospective employer would obtain a negative recommendation from someone other than Ms. Rusch--perhaps someone who was not aware of the settlement agreement or was not schooled in the proper manner of responding to inquiries governed by the agreement. Moreover, unlike in <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, the settlement agreement in this case imposed only three specific obligations on Ms. Rusch or her designee. Where pertinent, they were to "advise that [Ms. Godwin] resigned from the Agency for personal reasons," to state that she "was rated at the highly successful level," and to make "[n]o negative statements."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the first employer inquiry, Ms. Rusch complied with the terms of paragraph 11, stating that Ms. Godwin had "left for personal reasons" and that she had "performed at a highly successful level." Ms. Rusch made no negative statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Rusch's answers to the second employer were likewise not inconsistent with her obligations under the agreement. The second employer apparently did not ask why Ms. Godwin left the agency and did not ask about her overall rating, so the first two components of paragraph 11 were inapplicable. Ms. Rusch satisfied the third requirement of paragraph 11--not to make any negative statements--because each question she answered was answered with the favorable response that Ms. Godwin "met standards" in four particular areas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Mr. Mitchell, there was no evidence before the administrative judge that Mr. Mitchell was Ms. Rusch's designee within the meaning of the settlement agreement, so Ms. Godwin has failed to show that the settlement agreement covered the statements made by Mr. Mitchell. In any event, as the administrative judge found, Mr. Mitchell's responses to the questions that he answered were not unfavorable to her. The only specific response that could be regarded as negative was Mr. Mitchell's statement that Ms. Godwin "had an extended period of leave usage." The administrative judge, however, found that Mr. Mitchell's statement about Ms. Godwin's leave usage was true and did not constitute a release of negative information, particularly since Mr. Mitchell did not state or suggest that the leave was inappropriate or unapproved. The administrative judge's findings on that issue are supported by substantial evidence and we therefore decline to overturn them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Godwin's principal complaint is not with the questions that were answered, but with the ones that were not. She argues that Ms. Rusch's refusal to answer certain questions left a negative impression on the prospective employers, and that Mr. Mitchell's statement that he "took the 5th" with respect to the questions he declined to answer had an even greater negative effect. As the administrative judge pointed out, however, the settlement agreement did not preclude Ms. Rusch or her designee from declining to answer certain questions. While recognizing that there is an inherent risk that a limited or neutral reference might be taken as a "subtle signal to a knowledgeable prospective employer that there is some undisclosed problem," the administrative judge concluded that Ms. Godwin, who was represented by counsel in the settlement negotiations, "was obviously willing to accept this risk as part of the overall benefits obtained by the agreement." We agree. Upon being asked a question falling outside the specific areas covered by paragraph 11 of the settlement agreement, as to which an honest answer would be negative, Ms. Rusch had three choices: to give a false favorable answer, thereby deceiving the inquirer; to give a truthful negative answer, thereby breaching the provision of the agreement prohibiting negative statements; or to decline to answer the question. In that situation, it was perfectly permissible for Ms. Rusch to choose the third option, thereby avoiding either lying or breaching an express term of the agreement. We decline to interpret the "negative statement" provision of the agreement to impose an affirmative obligation on Ms. Rusch to lie to any prospective employer if a truthful answer would be negative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Mitchell's statement that he "took the 5th" in response to some of the questions asked of him is more troubling, but as noted above, Mr. Mitchell was not shown to be a designee of Ms. Rusch, and he was therefore not covered by paragraph 11 of the agreement. In any event, the question whether his reference to "the 5th," in context, constituted a negative statement is a factual matter. After analyzing Mr. Mitchell's comments, the administrative judge found that the agency did not fail to live up to its obligations under paragraph 11 of the agreement, and we are not prepared to conclude that that finding is unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We emphasize once again our discomfort with agreements of the sort at issue in this case. They seem almost bound to lead to mischief. If the agency gives a recommendation that is unresponsive or qualified in some respect, the employee is likely to conclude that the agency has done something to signal that his tenure was other than a happy one, and that the agency has therefore breached the settlement agreement. On the other hand, if the agency misrepresents its true views as to the employee's performance, it deceives prospective employers who are relying on the agency for an accurate recommendation. For that reason, we will not readily construe such an agreement to require an agency to deceive prospective employers; indeed, if an agreement were construed in such a fashion, it might well be unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Instead, we will construe such agreements strictly according to their terms, and we will not assume that silence in response to particular inquiries necessarily constitutes a "negative comment" on the employee's performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of what amounted to scripted references, the court observed, <span class="Italic">Zeh v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> 147 Fed. Appx. 977, 979 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The information all three agency employees are alleged to have provided about Mr. Zeh was only neutral, such as the title of his position and the fact that he had indeed been employed at the agency. All three declined to respond to Ms. Oparnica's request for more negative information, and referred Ms. Oparnica to the Human Resources Office. The fact that any astute potential employer would become suspicious by such evasive answers is a shortcoming of settlement agreements such as these, not the result of non-compliance by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barkett v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> 151 Fed. Appx. 951, 954 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Godwin,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> for the proposition that "because an agency's misrepresentation of its true views as to the employee's performance deceives prospective employers who are relying on the agency for an accurate recommendation, the court will not readily construe agreements to require an agency to deceive prospective employers but instead will construe such agreements strictly according to their terms").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The settlement should be reasonably specific as to who will provide references if the agency is to be charged with an unfavorable "rogue" reference, <span class="Italic">Salsbury v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 459, 461-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 15, 2003, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement, alleging that the agency violated the agreement when a prospective employer called the radiation safety office and was told by an unknown woman that the appellant no longer worked there. According to the appellant, the <span id="Page_5098"></span>agreement required the agency to vouch for his continued employment. The administrative judge ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument and to identify which specific clause of the agreement the agency allegedly breached. The show-cause order further provided that if the appellant did not respond by August 6, 2003, his petition for enforcement would be dismissed. The appellant did not respond to the order. The agency filed a response to the appellant's petition, in which it provided evidence of its compliance, and identified the woman who answered the phone as an employee of a private company of independent contractors, hired by the agency to provide radiation support services. The administrative judge issued an initial decision, dismissing the petition for enforcement without a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently filed this petition for review. The agency has not responded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his contention that the settlement agreement required the agency to "maintain the illusion" of his continued employment. However, as the administrative judge correctly noted, nothing in the agreement limits what the agency or its contractors can say if contacted by potential employers. in construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance<span class="Italic">. Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Thus, the Board will not read a nonexistent term into an agreement that is unambiguous<span class="Italic">. Kelley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 635, 641 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An instructive case is <span class="Italic">Godwin v. Department of Defense</span>, 228 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In <span class="Italic">Godwin</span>, the appellant and the agency entered a settlement agreement under which she withdrew her appeal of the agency's removal action, and the agency allowed her to resign. As in the instant case, the agreement did not generally require the agency to give a neutral reference or to represent that the appellant had a clean record. The agreement instead provided that the appellant would direct potential employers to an agency attorney (or her designee), who would state that the appellant resigned for personal reasons and was rated at the highly successful level. The court found that the agency "was thus protected against the risk that a prospective employer would obtain a negative recommendation from someone other than [the agency attorney] --perhaps someone who was not aware of the settlement agreement or was not schooled in the proper manner of responding to inquiries governed by the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1336. The agency in this case is likewise protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant claiming breach of a settlement clause governing a reference must prove more than suspicion that the agreement was not followed, <span class="Italic">Dunakoskie v. Nat'l. Capital Planning Comm'n.,</span> DC-0432-10-0179-C-1 (NP 8/9/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant asserts that prospective employers were "informed by the Agency that Appellant was not an Agency employee" and that such statements constituted a direct breach of the settlement agreement. The agreement stated that the appellant "must refer prospective employers to" particular personnel and stated what those four individuals were required to do if contacted. The appellant has not provided evidence that any agency official listed in the agreement provided information to prospective employers beyond that permitted by the contract, but presumes that such a breach must have occurred because he felt that he was asked suspicious questions or given suspicious comments by prospective employers. Accordingly, the appellant has not met his burden to show that the agency breached the agreement with respect to alleged disclosures of his unusual state of employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency fails to adhere to a settlement calling for a reference or precluding the release of negative information, the appellant must determine whether to enforce or rescind the agreement. The choice first made may bind the appellant through the remainder of the enforcement proceedings. The appellant cannot obtain relief under the agreement for a material breach and rescind the agreement based on that breach. The Board pointed out the consequences of an election concerning breach of a neutral reference provision in a settlement, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 115, 118-19 (1993), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant requests as well permission to rescind the settlement agreement. Citing the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Murphy v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 202 (1992), appellant argues that when a party breaches a settlement agreement, the other party is entitled to either enforce the agreement, or to rescind it and reinstate his appeal. Appellant "requests the opportunity to rescind the settlement agreement and go forward with a hearing on his removal from employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> is correct. Rescission of the settlement agreement, where there has been a material breach of the agreement, is one of the appropriate remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Betterly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 47 MSPR 63, 66-67 (1991) (the nonbreaching party has the option of enforcing the terms of the agreement or rescinding the agreement and going forward with the original claim). As the agency's breach in this case involved the violation of three pertinent clauses of the agreement, we find that its breach in this case is a material breach. The Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Murphy</span> and <span class="Italic">Betterly</span>, however, state that appellant has the option of enforcement <span class="Italic">or</span> rescission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case appellant requested enforcement of the settlement agreement which was ordered by the administrative judge. The agency submitted evidence that responded to the administrative judge's instructions. Appellant has, therefore, opted to enforce the agreement, and, although his request for back pay has been denied, he has succeeded in enforcing the agreement. As such, he cannot also exercise his option to rescind the same agreement. Accordingly, we deny appellant's request to rescind the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Fuller v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 611, 613-15 (1990), suggesting receipt of less than a full measure of the bargain, the appellant was distraught that, despite a cleansing of his record by settlement, word of his dismissal was leaked to a prospective employer. Neither the appellant nor the agency could identify the person who provided the adverse information, although the agency thought the information might have been provided by a former employee. The Board presented the appellant with the option of rescinding the agreement and reinstating the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under its appellate jurisdiction, the Board has broad authority to enforce a settlement agreement if it has been approved and made a part of the record....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under contract law, the party alleging breach of a settlement agreement has the burden of proving that the other party breached the agreement resulting in noncompliance.... Here, the agency has not disputed the appellant's claim that information regarding appellant's proposed removal was reported to a prospective employer. However, the agency contends that it does not know how the information was reported, that it has made every effort to abide by the agreement, and that it has taken all reasonable steps to insure that information regarding appellant's proposed removal is not reported.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If one party breaches a settlement agreement, the other party has the option of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement or rescinding the settlement agreement and going forward with the original claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arnold v. United States Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 1306, 1309 (9th Cir. 1987). Although the appellant has not specifically requested that the settlement agreement be set aside and his appeal reactivated, in his petition for enforcement he requested that his case be "reopened" because the agency failed to adhere to the settlement agreement. We construe this as a request to set aside the settlement agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record and the wording of the settlement agreement, it is unclear whether the appellant has established that the agency did, in fact, breach the settlement agreement. The meaning of the term, "file," and the meaning of the phrase, "records...concerning the removal," as used in the agreement are uncertain. We note that, although the agency was required to remove all records concerning the appellant's removal from his "file," it was not required to guarantee non-disclosure in any form. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the agency breached the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the case is REMANDED to the regional office to provide the appellant with an opportunity to submit evidence and argument as to whether the agency breached the settlement agreement.... If the administrative judge finds that the agency violated the agreement by failing to expunge the appropriate records from the "file," the appellant's petition for appeal should be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand Mr. Fuller again failed to persuade the Board that the agency breached its settlement, <span class="Italic">Fuller v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 211, 215-17 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reiterates his contention that the agency breached the parties' settlement agreement. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Fuller</span>, 45 MSPR at 614, "the party alleging breach of a settlement agreement has the burden of proving that the other party breached the agreement resulting in noncompliance." In the instant case, the parties' settlement agreement states in full as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Fuller will submit to the U.S. Postal Service, Birmingham, AL a regular resignation stating that the reason for the resignation is for personal reasons. In return the Agency agrees to remove all records from Mr. Fuller's file concerning the removal action of December 16, 1987 and letter of decision dated January 12, 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Both parties recognize that this agreement settles the above cited case and Mr. Fuller will withdraw the appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in our earlier decision, the agency "was not required to guarantee non-disclosure in any form." <span class="Italic">See</span> Fuller, 45 MSPR at 614. The agency presented evidence on remand that it took all necessary precautions to ensure that references to its removal action against the appellant were removed from his OPF. The appellant has not shown otherwise. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge correctly found on remand that the agency did not breach the terms of the parties' <span id="Page_5099"></span>settlement agreement, and that the appellant has not shown that the settlement agreement should be set aside, and the appeal reinstated, on this basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fuller, 45 MSPR at 615; <span class="Italic">Graff v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639, 644 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to contracts, "parol evidence is the same as extraneous evidence," and the "[parol] evidence rule seeks to reserve the integrity of written agreements by refusing to permit contracting parties to attempt to alter import of their contract though use of contemporaneous, oral declarations." <span class="Italic">See</span> Blacks Law Dictionary 1906 (5th ed. 1979). The Board has held that a settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">Miura v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 663, 668 (1989). It also has held that, in construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time that they contracted. <span class="Italic">id.</span> If the terms of the agreement are ambiguous, however, parol evidence is permissible to explain the terms. <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted above, the administrative judge in the present case afforded the parties the opportunity to explain the terms "file" and "records...concerning the removal," as used in the settlement agreement. We find that this action is consistent with the Board's August 14, 1990 Opinion and Order which, in remanding the case to the Atlanta Regional Office for the administrative judge to address the meaning of those terms, implicitly found that the terms were ambiguous and that parol evidence was permissible to explain them. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fuller, 45 MSPR at 614-15. <span class="Italic">See</span> also Miura, 39 MSPR at 668.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as the administrative judge correctly stated in her initial decision, the appellant and the agency agreed on the meaning of the terms at issue. Thus, even if the appellant had shown error by the administrative judge in considering parol evidence, he has shown no basis for reversal of the remand initial decision on this issue inasmuch as he has shown no resulting harm to his substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board can and occasionally does take affirmative action to implement settlements when the agency shortchanges the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Graff v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639, 643 (1989), a settlement required the agency to assist the appellant in his search for other employment and to provide the appellant with a letter of endorsement from the civilian personnel office. The letter that the agency provided, essentially no more than verification of employment, did not contain the affirmative endorsement of the appellant required by the agreement. The Board directed the agency to prepare a letter of endorsement expressing approval of the appellant's application for employment by "discussing the appellant's past excellent performance or by some other means." Because the agency had not effectuated the settlement to the point of compliance, the Board added in <span class="Italic">Graff</span> that "the time limits were tolled during the agency's noncompliance and should recommence on the date of issuance of this Opinion and Order."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 57 MSPR 115, 116-18 (1993), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, provided a measure of relief for the employee whose agency did not fully abide by an agreement to provide a neutral reference:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant alleged that terms of the agreement calling for the provision by the agency to prospective employers of a neutral reference had been violated by the agency. The agreement specified that inquiries to the agency by prospective employers of appellant would be directed to the Chief of Personnel or the Assistant Chief of Personnel and that the response would include the date appellant was hired, his position title, his history of fully satisfactory performance appraisals and letters of appreciation, and his status of leave without pay for personal reasons. The settlement agreement specified: "No negative information shall be disclosed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant submitted evidence indicating, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that in response to an inquiry by a prospective employer, the agency had stated that it could not provide any information regarding appellant's employment "because of a court decision." Appellant, alleging that this response resulted in his nonselection, requested that the Board award him back pay and compensatory damages. Based on the submitted evidence, the administrative judge held that the agency had, by issuing the response, violated the terms of the agreement. Accordingly, he ordered the agency to submit to the Clerk of the Board evidence that it had (1) admonished its agents to strictly comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, and (2) contacted the prospective employer and provided a reference that comported with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also held that back pay was not an appropriate remedy for breach of a settlement agreement, and that the Board lacked authority to award compensatory damages. Accordingly, appellant's requests in that regard were denied. The case was then forwarded to the Board for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted to the Clerk of the Board evidence purporting to comply with the Recommendation. The evidence consists of a memorandum reiterating that any inquiry by prospective employers of appellant were to be referred immediately to the Chief of Personnel, and a letter to the prospective employer reflecting the neutral information called for in the settlement agreement. Appellant submitted a response to this evidence. In the response, appellant argued that the administrative judge erred in denying his request for back pay, and requested anew a back pay award. Appellant also requested "the opportunity to rescind the settlement agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's submission to the Clerk of the Board contains evidence that it had issued to all relevant personnel the instruction that any employment inquiry about appellant was to be referred "[s]pecifically, to the Chief or the Assistant Chief of Personnel Service." The agency also attached a copy of a letter addressed to the prospective employer from the Chief of Personnel Service. The letter informed the prospective employer that the information that had been provided by the agency regarding appellant was incorrect. It stated further that appellant had been employed by the agency from August 4, 1985, to July 24, 1989, and that his performance during this time had been fully satisfactory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this evidence satisfactorily responds to the specific instruction in the Recommendation to "admonish its agents to strictly comply with the terms of the agreement," inform the prospective employer of its erroneous response to its inquiry, and "provide a neutral reference concerning the appellant." Accordingly, we hold that the agency has complied with the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his submission, appellant argues that back pay can, and should, be awarded in this case. He cites the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, for the proposition that a back pay award is called for when an employee has been the subject of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that results in the reduction or denial of pay due the employee. Appellant argues that in providing information that violated the terms of the settlement agreement the agency effected an unwarranted personnel action. His failure to secure employment with the prospective employer, appellant argues, resulted in the denial of pay due him. Appellant also cites the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 251 (1988), in support of his argument that back pay is justified in the breach of a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The portions of the settlement agreement breached by the agency, however, have been identified. This Opinion and Order retroactively enforces those provisions. Appellant's additional back pay argument depends upon a showing that absent the breach of the settlement agreement, he would have secured employment with the prospective employer. He has made no such showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's citation to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237 (1988), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, the appellant proved that the agency had breached a settlement agreement that specifically called for her reinstatement to the first GS-9, non-nursing care position to become open at a named installation. She proved that such positions had become open, and that she had not been reinstated to any of them. Put simply, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Moore</span> proved that she would have gotten the job had the agency complied with the settlement agreement. There was no such showing here, so <span class="Italic">Moore</span> does not apply to the instant case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller</span> and <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> were mentioned in another decision involving settlement of a personnel problem prior to a Board appeal. The employee agreed to resign for, among other obligations, the agency's promise to provide the employee with a "clean record." The allegation by the appellant, on appeal from his allegedly involuntary resignation, was that the agency violated its promise when allowing information to be divulged concerning an investigation into the appellant's conduct while he was an agency employee. The Board found no breach of the settlement agreement, but in its analysis the Board indirectly noted the significance of certain provisions that can be placed into a settlement, concluding in <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 136, 142-43 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...There is no indication that the parties agreed to terms to avoid such disclosure, e.g., that a specific person, identified by name or title, was designated to handle all employment inquiries regarding the appellant, or that only precise agreed-upon language would be used in responding to requests for such inquiries.... A mere reference to a "clean personnel record" does not require an agency "to guarantee non-disclosure in any form."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the agency could not have prevented an intra-agency disclosure even if it had wanted to do so. To adequately advise someone that he is not to disclose certain information, that individual must be made aware of the information that is not to be disclosed.... Because, in the instant appeal, Mr. Matthews was not apprised of the specific information he was not to disclose, his statements to the DOP did not constitute an agency breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an abbreviated opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board in <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 983 F.2d 226 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The lesson is that it is not enough <span id="Page_5100"></span>for an appellant to bargain for and obtain a "clean record." The settlement will need to be more specific to protect against any disclosures--direct or indirect--of information pertaining to the proposed adverse action and the investigation leading up to it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Summerset v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 273, 276 (1995) (settlement did not require agency to remove documents from OPF other than those concerning the removal action; agency was not obliged to correct a SF-50 unrelated to appellant's removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a nonprecedential opinion, <span class="Italic">Jolley v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3285), the court took a more realistic approach toward interpretation of a settlement to effectuate the apparent intent of the reference provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[A]n interpretation that gives a reasonable meaning to all parts of the contract will be preferred to one that leaves portions of the contract meaningless." <span class="Italic">Fortec Constructors v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 760 F.2d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Johnson Controls, Inc.</span>, 713 F.2d 1541, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). Defense argues that the agreement language, "at which time the Agency will <span class="Italic">correctly describe</span> the terms of his separation," (emphasis added) specifically allowed Defense, after the date of Mr. Jolley's resignation, to make disclosures regarding Mr. Jolley's poor performance. However, the agreement also provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "Mr. Jolley's removal from his position is rescinded and all documentation related thereto be expunged from his personnel records," "[t]he Agency shall purge its records of all information pertaining to Mr. Jolley except those records which are maintained in accordance with law and regulation," and "[t]he agency will provide a satisfactory interim evaluation for Mr. Jolley's use in seeking employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Defense's interpretation of the "correctly describe" language, the agency would only be required to respond favorably to inquiries regarding Mr. Jolley for approximately two months--from November 22, 1988, the date of the settlement agreement, to January 20, 1989, the effective date of Mr. Jolley's resignation. According to Defense, after this period the agency would be allowed to tell inquiring prospective employers that "there were adverse conditions concerning poor performance," or something similar, as Mr. Taylor did on at least two occasions. This construction renders pointless the agreement's provisions for Defense to purge its personnel records regarding Mr. Jolley and to permit Mr. Jolley's attorney "to review this record to insure all corrections have been accomplished" prior to the agency's releasing any such information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, under Defense's construction of the agreement, the interim performance evaluation provided by Mr. Taylor would be valid for only two months, as Mr. Taylor's disclosures nullified the "fully satisfactory" rating he gave Mr. Jolley on that evaluation. We conclude, however, that the parties intended that Mr. Jolley would use the evaluation to search for a new job even after his resignation, because it would be unreasonable to believe Mr. Jolley would give up his right to appeal for only a two-month window in which to find a new job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Inasmuch as Defense's interpretation would render several clauses of the settlement agreement meaningless, we construe the phrase "correctly describe the terms of his separation" in the context of the settlement agreement to mean that the agency was not to divulge Mr. Jolley's performance problems with the agency to inquiring outside employers, but rather was to describe his separation as a resignation after fully satisfactory performance. Therefore, the agency's disclosures, via Mr. Taylor, to the private companies who inquired about Mr. Jolley, constituted a breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the discussion above reveals, here the AJ's construction of the settlement agreement was clearly not in accordance with law.... Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Board for a determination of the remedy to be provided to Mr. Jolley.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Patterson v. USDA</span>, 55 MSPR 499, 500-04 (1992), the Board took an interest in and enforced provisions relating to reference check procedures developed in a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the decision of the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) to remove him from the position of Agricultural Management Specialist for failure to follow instructions. After the appeal was filed, the appellant and the agency settled the case, and the settlement was accepted into the record for purposes of enforcement.... As relevant here, the agreement provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4. No SF-50 or any other documents in any on [sic] appellant's personnel files or records will contain any other reference to the proposed or effected removal, this appeal, or this settlement agreement and no agency personnel will communicate to any third parties any contrary, conflicting, or otherwise derogatory information, it being the intention of the parties that the appellant's records will be a "clean slate." The agency affirmatively pledges to take no action and to make no statements that would hinder appellant's ability to effectively compete for future federal or private employment and to advise its personnel of this obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 22, 1991, the appellant petitioned the Board to enforce compliance with the agreement. In the petition, the appellant asserted that the agency violated paragraph four of the settlement agreement (quoted above) when one of appellant's former supervisors provided unfavorable information about appellant to another agency supervisor who was considering appellant for a job. The administrative judge agreed with the appellant's argument and issued a Recommendation finding the agency in noncompliance. For a remedy, the administrative judge recommended that appellant be provided with the opportunity to reinstate his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's petition for enforcement has its origins in an incident arising shortly after the execution of the settlement agreement. According to the evidence of record, appellant applied for a position with FmHA in Pennsylvania. As part of a reference check, Mr. Michael Matsko, Pennsylvania District Director, called Mr. Joel Weirick, the agency's New York District Director and a former supervisor of appellant. During that conversation, Mr. Weirick referred Mr. Matsko to the agency's Employee Relations Branch in Washington, D.C. when asked about the circumstances surrounding the appellant's resignation. However, he also told Mr. Matsko that he "had some problems with Mr. Patterson' [sic] performance and, at one point, had sent him a letter outlining his unacceptable job performance in the area of servicing FmHA inventory properties and giving him an opportunity to improve his performance." Thus, it is clear that the agency's New York District Director provided unfavorable information to Mr. Matsko at a time when Mr. Matsko was considering the appellant for a job. The question before the Board, then, is whether disclosure of this information within the agency to an official considering the appellant for a job violates the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract and the interpretation of its terms is a question of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dati v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 397, 400 (1989). In construing the terms of the agreement, the words of the agreement are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time that they contracted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The parties are bound by the terms of the settlement, <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 149 (1988), and the Board may not modify those terms through its decision. <span class="Italic">Colonel v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 285, 291 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in return for the withdrawal of the appeal and appellant's resignation, the agency "affirmatively pledge[d] to take no action and to make no statements that would hinder appellant's ability to effectively compete for future federal or private employment and to advise its personnel of this obligation." Appellant's application for a job with FmHA's Pennsylvania State Office is obviously an effort to "compete for future federal...employment," and Mr. Weirick's comments to Mr. Matsko clearly "hinder[ed] appellant's ability to effectively compete" for that position. Therefore, the Board finds that the agency violated the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that it did not violate the settlement agreement because the agreement only prevented the agency from disclosing information related to appellant's resignation. While it is true, as the agency points out, that the purpose of the agreement was to settle the appellant's appeal of his removal, and that there are several provisions that deal specifically with the removal action, it is also true that the agreement "affirmatively pledges...to make <span class="Italic">no</span> statements that would hinder appellant's ability to effectively compete for future federal or private employment...." (Emphasis added). Given this broad pledge, the agency's interpretation of the agreement cannot be accepted. The clear language of the agreement prohibits the agency from releasing any unfavorable information whether it is related to the resignation or not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that it did not violate the agreement because the disclosures were made to an individual within the agency rather than to a "third party" as contemplated by the agreement. In support of this argument, the agency cites a portion of paragraph four that states that "no agency personnel will communicate to any third parties any contrary, conflicting, or otherwise derogatory information." It is not clear, however, what the parties intended by the term "third party." They could have intended the term to mean any individual that was unaware of the agreement, including employees of the agency, or they could have intended the term to refer to only individuals outside of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Betterly v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 47 MSPR 63, 67 (1991) (finding the term "3rd party" in a settlement agreement to be ambiguous).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the meaning of "third party" does not have to be resolved in this opinion. For in the same paragraph of the agreement that the term "third party" appears, the agency also promises to "make no statements that would hinder appellant's ability to effectively compete for future federal...employment." This last provision, on its face, applies to all Federal employers, including FmHA. As a result, when Mr. Weirick made unfavorable comments to Mr. Matsko about the appellant's performance, the settlement agreement was violated even though the comments were directed to another employee of FmHA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is hereby provided the option of setting aside the settlement agreement and reinstating the appeal. <span class="Italic">Betterly</span>, 47 MSPR at 67. <span id="Page_5101"></span>The appeal may be reinstated by refiling the appeal with the Board's New York Regional Office within 30 days of the date of this opinion.[2] If the appellant does not choose to reinstate the appeal, the agency is hereby ordered to instruct all of appellant's former supervisors that they may not release any unfavorable information about appellant to any prospective employers, including those within FmHA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In the event the Board found it in noncompliance, the agency requested "verbiage" in our opinion "to the effect" that the appellant will be liable for the $22,000 he received under the agreement if he sets the agreement aside and then loses on the merits. We decline this invitation to include such an advisory opinion. At present, there is no dispute over that money because the appellant has not claimed the right to keep it irrespective of the outcome of any future Board proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCURRING OPINION OF ANTONIO C. AMADOR, VICE CHAIRMAN</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I concur with the majority's decision. However, I believe that it is important for the appellant to fully understand the potential consequences of reinstating the appeal. As part of the settlement agreement, appellant received $22,000. If he reinstates the appeal and loses, appellant will be liable to the agency for the $22,000 he has already collected under the agreement. In addition, if he prevails on appeal, any back pay or attorney fees he would be due would be subject to an offset against the $22,000.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 659, 660-65 (1994), emphasized that agencies should not indirectly circumvent provisions in settlements designed to provide clean records and good references. The Board explained the facts and equitable considerations that would govern interpretation of the settlement and, on the facts before it, permit rescission of the settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case removed the appellant, a Criminal Investigator, for falsifying travel vouchers. The appellant appealed that action to the Board's San Francisco Regional Office. The parties then settled the appeal by entering into an agreement that provided, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the agency would: (1) Substitute, for the form documenting the removal, a form reflecting that the appellant resigned; (2) remove all documents and records related to the removal from the appellant's official personnel file; and (3) direct all employment inquiries to the appellant's former second-level supervisor or, in that official's absence, to the Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations. The agency further agreed that the official to whom the inquiries were directed would provide only the information described in the settlement agreement--i.e., the official would say that the appellant had resigned from his position for personal reasons, and he would advise the inquirer of the dates on which the appellant's employment with the agency began and ended, and of the type of work he performed. Finally, the parties agreed that the Board would have the authority to enforce the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently applied for the position of Investigator in the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). An official of that agency offered the position to the appellant, but the offer was contingent on the results of a suitability inquiry. In connection with that inquiry, the appellant signed a document authorizing and directing his former employing agency to release information regarding his activities, including information regarding his "achievement, performance,...personal history, [and] disciplinary...records," to "any [HUD] investigator or duly accredited representative" of that agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A HUD investigator interviewed one of the officials named in the agreement, Thomas Sheehan, who had been the appellant's second-level supervisor. Mr. Sheehan initially provided the investigator with only the information described in the settlement agreement. After the investigator showed him the release the appellant had signed, however, Mr. Sheehan allowed the investigator to review an investigative file the agency maintained in connection with the appellant's employment--a file that Mr. Sheehan knew included information regarding the charge on which the removal was based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The investigator also contacted the appellant's former immediate supervisor. Although that supervisor declined to provide information about the appellant to the investigator, he granted the investigator's request that he be allowed to ask the appellant's former coworkers about the appellant. Those coworkers provided negative comments about the appellant and his suitability for an Investigator position. Based on the information the investigator gathered, the HUD official who had made the conditional job offer to the appellant withdrew that offer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for enforcement in which he alleged that the agency violated the settlement agreement by providing the investigator with access to its investigative file, and by allowing him to interview the appellant's coworkers. The administrative judge found that the appellant, by signing the release described above, had authorized the agency to disclose its investigative file to the investigator. He also found that the agreement did not address situations in which a potential employer sought to interview the appellant's coworkers, that it did not direct the agency to prevent disclosure of information by those coworkers, and that "[i]t must have been apparent to the appellant when he signed the release that [the investigator]...would likely speak to the appellant's co-workers as well as his superiors." Accordingly, the administrative judge found that the agency had not violated the agreement, and he denied the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant again argues on petition for review that the agency violated the settlement agreement when it gave the investigator access to its investigative file concerning the appellant. The agency argues that this action was proper for two reasons. First, it asserts that the agreement itself permitted the agency to release information from that file. The agreement does include a provision that information maintained by the agency's Office of the Inspector General could be "subject to release under the Privacy Act." The same provision requires, however, that any such information "be requested in writing pursuant to the Privacy Act and/or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)...." The agency does not contend, and the record does not indicate, that it received any written Privacy Act or FOIA request for the investigative file. Instead, the record shows that the agency provided the file to the HUD investigator after he made an oral request for the file and showed the agency the release the appellant had signed--a release that clearly did not constitute a Privacy Act or FOIA request. Furthermore, although the agreement permits the agency to disclose certain other information "with respect to security clearances or background checks conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or by another agency or organization pursuant to delegation by OPM, or workmens' [sic] compensation, unemployment or retirement claims," this provision also is not applicable here. The agency does not allege that the HUD investigator was investigating the appellant's background pursuant to any OPM delegation, and it clearly did not provide the file in connection with any unemployment claim, retirement claim, or inquiry conducted by the FBI or OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's second argument concerning the investigative file is that the appellant, by signing the release, authorized the agency's action. We find this argument unpersuasive. As we have indicated above, the form the appellant signed authorized the release of information regarding his "achievement, performance,...personal history, [and] disciplinary...records.... The settlement agreement does not prohibit the release of this information, however. Instead, it prescribes the manner in which information of this nature will be disclosed. Nothing in the release form modified the terms of the settlement agreement that are related to the disclosure of this kind of information. Instead, the form simply provided, in effect, that HUD was to be given the information authorized under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that construing the release form's provisions broadly enough to authorize disclosures inconsistent with the settlement agreement's provisions would be inconsistent with the purpose of the settlement agreement. Virtually all prospective employers seek information concerning an applicant's work record. Accordingly, appellants and agencies entering into agreements like the one at issue here can expect prospective employers to ask for permission to contact the appellants' former employers. A refusal to grant such a request would be fatal to the appellant's employment prospects. Adverse information and negative references from the former employer can be just as damaging to those prospects, as the facts of this case show. An important purpose of an agreement such as this one is to give the appellant a clean record and a neutral or positive reference upon inquiry by a prospective employer, so that the appellant is not forced to choose between losing an employment opportunity by refusing to allow the prospective employer to check his work record and losing that opportunity because of adverse information provided by his former employer. When an employee signs a release such as the one at issue here, he is entitled to assume that his former employer will live up to the terms of any agreement with him that is not inconsistent with the terms of the release. In this case, the agency violated the settlement agreement by disclosing information beyond that described in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues further that it could not prohibit the appellant's coworkers from talking to the HUD investigator because those coworkers were not parties to the agreement and therefore were not bound by its provisions; and it argues that, even if the coworkers had been bound by the agreement, the form the appellant signed released them from this bond. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, for the reasons stated above, the authorization form did not relieve the agency of its obligation to comply with the agreement's provisions limiting disclosure of information regarding the appellant. Furthermore, we see no merit to the agency's other argument regarding this matter. As the appellant has suggested, the agreement does not appear to prohibit coworkers from responding to questions asked of them at their homes, without agency knowledge of the inquiries. Those circumstances, however, are not present here. Instead, as we have indicated above, the <span id="Page_5102"></span>investigator requested and obtained permission from the appellant's former supervisor to interview the appellant's coworkers. Furthermore, the interviews were conducted at the coworkers' work site, during working hours, and over agency telephones. Before the interviews began, the supervisor told the investigator he was free to talk to the employees, and he even appears to have placed the telephone call to the employees and introduced them to the investigator.... This is not a situation in which the agency played no part in its employees' disclosures; the agency here knowingly facilitated the disclosure of information that was not covered in the agreement and that was provided by sources other than those identified in the agreement. An agency may not circumvent the provisions of a binding contract in this manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that condoning actions such as those taken by the agency in this case would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals by providing appellants with clean records and neutral or positive employment references. Agreements such as the one at issue here are common methods of settling appeals, and they undoubtedly have provided beneficial results in many cases. Finding that the agency actions at issue here were permitted by the settlement agreement would give appellants little or no incentive to agree to similar settlements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agreement calls for a recommendation, the agreement will not, without more, be construed to require the agency to respond only to written requests for references. The agreement will be construed to encompass oral reference checks. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hoffman v. GSA</span>, 57 MSPR 502, 506-07 &#x0026; n.4 (1993) (agency memo prohibiting responses to oral reference checks was not issued until after the incident leading to the enforcement decision and, "in any case, it cannot affect the terms of the settlement agreement that contain no such limitation"). In <span class="Italic">Hoffman,</span> the agency asserted that the reference check was a "set-up" from a friend of the appellant. The Board observed that "[p]roof that the call was not from a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> outside employer would have given the agency a defense based upon the plain words of the agreement." The agreement called for the agency to provide a recommendation when appropriate managerial or personnel officials "are inquired of by other government agencies or outside employers...."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There may be an issue of materiality of the breach of a provision requiring a particular form of employment reference. <span class="Italic">Reniere v. USDA</span>, 62 MSPR 648, 653-54 (1994), considered burdens of proof and permitted the appellant to set aside an agreement when the employer provided an unfavorable reference despite the failure of the bad reference to block the appellant's employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency breached the agreement. In the proceedings before the administrative judge, the agency argued that Dr. Stafford fulfilled the agency's duties under the settlement agreement by his affirmative response to the question of satisfactory performance and his statement that the appellant resigned from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement, however, specified that "[n]o statement would be made referencing unacceptable performance." To construe that provision as allowing the agency to make negative statements about the appellant's performance as long as the agency also states that her performance was acceptable would render the provision meaningless. We do not subscribe to such an interpretation. "[a]n interpretation that gives a reasonable meaning to all parts of the contract will be preferred to one that leaves portions of the contract meaningless." <span class="Italic">Fortec Constructors v. United States</span>, 760 F.2d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 1985), quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Johnson Controls, Inc.</span>, 713 F.2d 1541, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Graff v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 639, 643 (1989), the Board reached a similar result. The terms of the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Graff</span> required the agency to provide a letter of endorsement to the appellant to assist in his search for employment. The letter provided by the agency stated only that the appellant had worked for the agency in several positions. Finding that the agency had breached the agreement, the Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although the settlement agreement [did] not require the agency to give examples of the appellant's excellent, past performance, we find that, to comply with the agreement, the letter of endorsement must express approval of the appellant either by discussing the appellant's past excellent performance or by some other means.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 643.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 55 MSPR 499, 502 (1992), the Board found that a provision requiring the agency to make "no statements that would hinder the appellant's ability" to seek employment prohibited the agency from releasing <span class="Italic">any</span> unfavorable information, regardless of whether it related to the appellant's resignation pursuant to the settlement....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to materiality of a bad reference, and a different approach, refer to <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3342), discussed in the next subsection.</p>
