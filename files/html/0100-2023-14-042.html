<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-43"><span class="space">3.</span> Not All Charges Sustained; Maximum Reasonable Penalty</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency need not break down misconduct into charges and subcharges or specifications and subspecifications, many agencies do so. The decisions have not followed a straight path concerning penalty review by the Board when not all the charges are sustained. What if some charges are not sustained while others are upheld? <span class="Italic">Eichner v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 202, 209 &#x00B6; 16 (1999), expressed the general rule now followed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where as here the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, the Board may not independently determine a reasonable penalty; however, unless the agency has expressed that a lesser penalty would be imposed if fewer than all of the charges are sustained, the Board may mitigate to the maximum reasonable penalty, if a careful balancing of the factors cited in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280 (1981), <span id="Page_2335"></span>warrants, or impose the same penalty imposed by the agency based on a justification of that penalty as the maximum reasonable penalty derived from the balancing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors<span class="Italic">. LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 1999)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Addo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DC-0752-16-0427-I-1 (NP 5/4/2022), expanded on the theme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, the Board does not sustain all of the charges, it will carefully consider whether the sustained charges merit the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Boo v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 17 (2014). The process of mitigation is not, however, a mathematical one in which the penalty previously imposed must be reduced by the percentage of the charges and specifications not sustained. <span class="Italic">Valdez v. Department of Justice</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 390, 394 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may mitigate the penalty imposed by the agency to the maximum penalty that is reasonable in light of the sustained charges as long as the agency has not indicated either in its final decision or in proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed for fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Boo</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 17. Here, the deciding official did not indicate that he would have imposed a lesser penalty if only specifications one and two of charge two were sustained. As already noted, the agency argues, however, that the appellant should still be removed based on the sustained misconduct. Thus, the issue before the Board is whether the administrative judge erred in mitigating the appellant's removal to a 30-day suspension for the two sustained specifications under the charge of unprofessional conduct and harassment, and, if she did err, what penalty should be imposed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Alaniz v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALANIZ_GEORGE_SF_0752_04_0553_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249182.pdf">100 MSPR 105</a>, 112 &#x00B6; 14 (2005), also provided the Board's position on mitigation when fewer than all charges are sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency proves fewer than all of its charges, the Board may not independently determine a reasonable penalty, but rather may mitigate to the maximum reasonable penalty so long as the agency has not indicated in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Gray v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 617 &#x00B6; 11 (2004). The Board may impose the same penalty imposed by the agency based on a justification of that penalty as the maximum reasonable penalty after balancing the mitigating factors. <span class="Italic">Gray</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 617 &#x00B6; 11. In reviewing an agency's penalty selection, the Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility, but to determine whether management exercised its judgment within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lybbert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-0752-12-0528-I-1 (NP 7/23/2013), restated the formulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In setting forth the legal standard, the agency asserts that <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999), allows the Board to mitigate an agency's penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty "<span class="Italic">so long as</span> the agency has not indicated in either its final decision or in proceedings before the Board that it desires that a full penalty be imposed on fewer charges." (emphasis in original). The agency's gloss on <span class="Italic">Devall</span> misstates the holding in that case, effectively diminishing the Board's authority to mitigate penalties. Instead, the Board will consider carefully whether the sustained charges merit the penalty imposed by the agency when not all of the charges are sustained. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 673, &#x00B6; 34 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 308). In such circumstances, the Board may mitigate the agency's penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty <span class="Italic">so long as the agency has not indicated in either its final decision or in proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260) (emphasis added). Although the Board may not disconnect its penalty determination from the agency's managerial will and primary discretion in disciplining employees, it nevertheless exercises "independent balancing authority...to realign the precise correspondence between agency action and agency justification mandated by the statute." <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1257-58. If an agency penalty is unreasonably severe or abusive, the Board may mitigate the penalty to bring it within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1258.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When not all the charges are sustained, the Board has characterized its obligation with regard to penalty selection as not necessarily the penalty that the Board views as the best or most reasonable, but instead the maximum penalty that the Board finds to be within the parameters of reasonableness, unless the agency expresses a desire that a lesser penalty be imposed for fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Zayer v. VA</span>, 90 MSPR 51, 55 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 320-21 (1981)); <span class="Italic">Starks v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...When, as here, the Board sustains the agency's charge, but not all of the specifications of the charge, the agency's chosen penalty is entitled to deference, and the Board will review that penalty to determine whether it is within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Payne v.

In applying this standard, the Board will consider the agency's failure to sustain all of its supporting specifications. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That failure may require, or contribute to, a finding that the agency's penalty is not reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Particularly pertinent to this appeal, we note that a general charge like the one here, i.e., conduct unbecoming, may be sustained when the Board finds that the appellant engaged in inappropriate behavior, even though it does not rise to the level of impropriety asserted by the agency; however, the penalty should reflect only the proven level of impropriety. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 284 F.3d 1304, 1309-10 &#x0026; n.2 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nor do the parties contend that the VA indicated it would like a lesser penalty on fewer charges....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">McGachey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 394 Fed. Appx. 688, 692 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), the court provided considerable deference to an agency's determination that removal was justified by less than all of the charges ultimately sustained by the Board "when the agency makes clear, as it did here, that it would have imposed the same penalty based only on those charges that were upheld":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We regard the penalty imposed in this case to be quite harsh for the conduct at issue, particularly in light of the administrative judge's dismissal of the charge of refusal to carry out assigned duties. Nonetheless, we are constrained by the very narrow scope of our review of agency penalty decisions. Under the governing standard, when the agency makes clear, as it did here, that it would have imposed the same penalty based only on those charges that were upheld, we cannot overturn the agency's choice of penalty unless we conclude that the penalty was "totally unwarranted in light of all factors," <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1251, or "so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion," <span class="Italic">O'Neill v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 220 F.3d 1354, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Notwithstanding our discomfort with the harshness of the result in this case, we are not able to conclude that the penalty is so excessive as to satisfy that exacting standard, particularly with regard to the AWOL charge. There is substantial evidence supporting the Board's finding that Ms. McGachey intentionally violated the sick leave policy; moreover, she had been disciplined for an AWOL charge on a previous occasion. Both of those facts constitute aggravating factors under the circumstances. Therefore, despite our reservations about the severity of the penalty imposed in this case, we decline to overturn the Board's decision upholding the agency's removal decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Speaking generally, and from decision from early on the Board's existence, the agency's failure to prove all of the charges supporting an adverse action is immaterial as long as the charges proved support the action effected. <span class="Italic">McGrath v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 500, 503 (1981) (citing <span class="Italic">Greenway v. United States,</span> 175 Ct.

Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 355 U.S. 883 (1957)). If the misconduct is sustained but some redundant charges are not, the AJ determines whether the remaining charges and circumstances support the penalty chosen by the agency as the maximum reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hayslett v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 267, 270-71 (1988); <span class="Italic">Marchand v. EEOC</span>, 12 MSPR 584, 585 (1982) (relying on <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 320 (1981)). "Whether a penalty is appropriate and promotes the efficiency of the service must be determined upon the basis of all the sustained charges, not on the basis of individual charges viewed in isolation." <span class="Italic">Pelham v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 9 MSPR 200, 205 n.6 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Render v. VA</span>, 90 MSPR 441, 447 &#x00B6; 17 (2001) ("[t]he additional aspects of these charges that we do not sustain are not so significant when arrayed against the sustained charges that they now render the removal penalty unreasonable."). In a case brought against an employee by the Special Counsel, the existence of more than one legal basis for a challenge to a respondent's conduct does not justify the imposition of a greater penalty. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Ross</span>, 34 MSPR 197, 204 (1987). [Refer to Chapter 11, "Framing of Charge," for decisions discussing construction of charges.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's role in penalty review is more complicated if different charges describe different improprieties, some sustained and some not. There is a distinction between elements of a single charge--each legal component to be proved to establish the charge--and multiple factual specifications supporting a single charge. The first situation is characterized by an offense, e.g., fraud, requiring intent plus a taking or conversion of property. Each element must be established to prove the charge. The second situation may involve multiple incidents of related misconduct characterized as one charge, e.g., disruptive behavior. In this situation one but not all of the specifications may be sufficient, if proved, to support the charge. <span class="Italic">Bree v. DHHS</span>, 49 MSPR 68, 71 (1991), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's first charge, physical assault on a co-worker, contained two separate specifications. One alleged that the appellant "physically struck Ms. Ketchum in the face with [her] fist," and the second asserted that the appellant "physically spit in Ms. Ketchum's face during the altercation."...In <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990), the court held that the Board may not sustain a charge if the agency fails to prove one of its elements. It specifically distinguished, however, the situation where, as here, "more than one event or factual specification is set out to support a single charge." The court stated that "[I]n that case, proof of one or more, but not all, of the supporting specifications is sufficient to sustain the charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, we find that proof of the specification of physically striking with the fist is sufficient to sustain the charge of physical assault.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach was at times inconsistent. Before 1999 and the <span class="Italic">LaChance</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post,</span> some decisions held if an agency's action was based on multiple charges or specifications and if some are not sustained, the Board must take a more active role than usual in determining whether the sustained misconduct merits the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">Vigil v.

[Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-044.html#sec7-45">All Charges But Not All Specifications Sustained; Part of a Specification Sustained</a>."] "Whenever the agency's action is based upon multiple charges and specifications, some of which are not sustained, the Board will carefully consider whether the sustained charges and specifications merit the penalty imposed." <span class="Italic">Stewart-Maxwell v.

Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 497 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Mitigation is not a mathematical process; although less than 10% of charges are sustained, those remaining may be sufficiently serious to warrant removal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases in which the appropriateness of the penalty is at issue and where some of the initial charges have not been sustained, the presiding official's decision to sustain the penalty should contain a reasoned explanation demonstrating that all relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were properly considered....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this case is different from <span class="Italic">Kumferman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 785 F.2d 286 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In <span class="Italic">Kumferman</span>, the petitioner was charged with unauthorized possession of government property, theft, and falsifying official records and removed from his position with the Navy. We did not uphold the charge of falsifying official records.

<p class="Body-Text">Through 1999, the Board's position often was that when a penalty was excessive because not all charges were sustained, the AJ was responsible for determining the maximum penalty that the Board would find to be within the parameters of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Valdez,</span> Chairman Erdreich presented the better view of the law in his dissent, 65 MSPR at 403:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no rule in the statutory or common law of the workplace that states that an employee is to be disciplined at the maximum degree for an offense. Rather, the inverse is normally considered true: a penalty selection should be made at the minimum level that will correct the misconduct.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 655 (1991); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 27 MSPR 227 (1985); <span class="Italic">Platt v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 8 MSPB 170, 8 MSPR 495 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After review and consideration of the Board's case law, we find that the use of the same "maximum reasonable" penalty standard regardless of whether all of the charges are sustained ignores a significant difference between the two types of cases. Where all of the charges are sustained, the agency has made a measurable penalty determination based solely on the sustained charges. That determination may appropriately be measured against a reasonableness standard and may be corrected by the Board if it exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. In deference to the agency's primary discretion to direct its work force, the Board will correct such an excessive penalty only to the extent necessary to bring it "within the parameters of reasonableness," as set forth in <span class="Italic">Davis</span> and <span class="Italic">Douglas. See Davis,</span> 8 MSPR at 320-21; <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 306. This "maximum reasonable" penalty standard is, and continues to be, a correct and fitting scope of review for those cases in which all of the charges are sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "maximum reasonable" penalty standard, however, is not a tenable standard for reviewing penalties in those cases where fewer than all of the charges are sustained. In such cases, the basis for the agency's penalty determination no longer exists. Rather, the agency's choice of penalty rests on incorrect premises. There is no longer a clear and measurable agency determination which can be corrected if it exceeds the parameters of reasonableness. Thus, when not all of the charges are sustained, the penalty determination made by the agency no longer stands. There is no definitive penalty selection to review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can there honestly be any question of second-guessing what the agency's penalty might have been in order to measure it against the parameters of reasonableness. Such an inquiry would necessarily involve some speculation. To defer to an agency determination that was made on the basis of the charges that were not sustained, therefore, necessarily involves indulging in a legal fiction. It is comparable to the search for the "Holy Grail" in Arthurian legends and similarly doomed by the impossibility of its execution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, use of the "maximum reasonable" penalty in appeals where not all of the charges are sustained may result in the selection of a "maximum" penalty in situations where the agency might have selected a lesser penalty. A maximum reasonable penalty standard implies that the salient part of the determination is not its reasonableness but its degree of severity. Yet, there is no requirement that an agency discipline an employee at the maximum degree. Rather, the inverse is normally considered true: A penalty selection is normally sought at the minimum level to correct the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 303-04 (an adverse action should be ordered only after a responsible determination that a less severe penalty is inadequate, citing Federal Personnel Manual, ch. 751, subch. 1-2b (Dec. 21, 1976)). The application of the "maximum reasonable" penalty standard in such cases thus could actually foreclose the implementation of what might be the most appropriate penalty reasonably considered to correct the misconduct, replacing it instead with the maximum penalty. The Board did not intend this problematic result in either <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> or <span class="Italic">Davis</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not believe that the solution to this problem is to remand the case to the agency for a reconsidered penalty determination in light of the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Valdez v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 65 MSPR 390, 402-03 (1994) (Erdreich, Chairman, concurring in part and dissenting in part). To do so would require the agency to make a new penalty determination on remand and permit the employee to file a new appeal to the Board to review that new penalty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 295. This would needlessly prolong the discipline and appeal process, <span class="Italic">id</span>., contrary to our statutory duty to "expedite to the extent practicable" our proceedings, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(i)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the far more efficient and expeditious solution is for the Board to continue its present system of making the penalty selection in cases when not all of the charges are sustained, and then directing the agency to implement the penalty selected by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 295. The Board's penalty selection in such cases, however, shall no longer be made under the "maximum reasonable" penalty standard. Instead, in cases where fewer than all of the charges are sustained, we now adopt a "reasonable" penalty standard. As delineated further below, under this standard, the Board will independently and responsibly balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine a reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 308.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In many cases, the application of a "reasonable" penalty standard rather than the "maximum reasonable" penalty standard will not have any practical difference. In many cases, for example, the "maximum reasonable" penalty and the "reasonable" penalty will be the same<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Valdez,</span> 65 MSPR at 402-03 (Erdreich, Chairman, concurring in part and dissenting in part). Application of a "reasonable" penalty standard will, however, ensure that the Board is not forced to engage in conjecture and select a "maximum" penalty, out of supposed "deference" to a determination which an agency never made, when a lesser penalty is reasonable. Further, in cases when not all of the charges are sustained, a "reasonable" penalty standard involves a more honest inquiry, and one ultimately truer to that of determining a penalty "within the parameters of reasonableness," as originally set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Davis</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also previously ruled that statements by deciding officials concerning what penalties they would have imposed had all of the charges not been sustained are irrelevant to the Board's penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 66 MSPR 68, 95 (1994); <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. Dept. of Defense,</span> 55 MSPR 504, 510 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 5 F.3d 1504 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 6, 8 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 776 F.2d 1058 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). The only apparent rationale for this rule is found in <span class="Italic">Patterson,</span> 22 MSPR at 8, the first Board decision to set forth and apply this rule. There, the Board reiterated its penalty standard for cases involving fewer than all sustained charges as set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 308--i.e., that whenever the agency's action is based on multiple charges some of which are not sustained, the administrative judge "should consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency." The Board did not explain in <span class="Italic">Patterson</span> or its progeny, however, why it considered irrelevant to its penalty determination under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> standard, statements by deciding officials concerning what penalties they would have imposed had all of the charges not been sustained. <span class="Italic">See Patterson</span>, 22 MSPR at 8; <span class="Italic">Beardsley</span>, 55 MSPR at 510; <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 66 MSPR at 95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor did the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> address such statements by deciding officials. In fact, a rule that such statements are irrelevant to the Board's penalty determination appears to be at odds with the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. In <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, the Board stated that "when the appellant challenges the severity of the penalty, or when the Board's [administrative judge] perceives genuine issues of justice or equity casting doubt on the appropriateness of the penalty selected by the agency, the agency will be called upon to present such further evidence as it may choose to rebut the appellant's challenge or to satisfy the" administrative judge. <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 MSPR at 308 (footnote omitted). Such rebuttal evidence, we believe, conceivably encompasses statements by deciding officials concerning what penalties they would have imposed had all of the charges not been sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we now clarify that the Board, in determining a reasonable <span id="Page_2338"></span>penalty in cases where not all of the charges are sustained, will consider statements by deciding officials concerning what penalties they would have imposed for the sustained charges. Such statements, we believe, may be relevant to the Board's determination of a reasonable penalty in those cases, for example, where such statements are supported by a table of penalties. While, inasmuch as the Board is responsible for balancing the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and determining a reasonable penalty, these statements should not be given absolute deference, they should be carefully weighed where the administrative judge finds the testimony of the deciding official credible. To the extent that our previous decisions have held that such statements are irrelevant to the Board's penalty determination, we hereby overrule them. <span class="Italic">See Hillen,</span> 66 MSPR at 95; <span class="Italic">Beardsley,</span> 55 MSPR at 510; <span class="Italic">Patterson,</span> 22 MSPR at 8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White</span> was reaffirmed following the Board's review of an OPM reconsideration petition in <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 468, 471-74 (1998), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246 (Fed.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 75 MSPR 84, 91 (1997) ("[I]n many cases, applying a 'reasonable' penalty standard rather than the 'maximum reasonable' penalty standard will not make any practical difference because the penalty under either standard will be the same."); <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 72 MSPR 369, 374 (1996) (following <span class="Italic">White</span> and applying the "reasonable" penalty standard when not all charges are sustained).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On OPM's petition for review, the Federal Circuit reviewed <span class="Italic">White</span> and found the Board's analysis wanting. The Board, said the court, lacks the authority to do more than review the agency's exercise of discretion in setting a penalty when some or all of the charges are sustained. When the Board sustains all of an agency's charges the Board may mitigate the agency's original penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty if it finds the agency's original penalty too severe. When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, the Board may mitigate to the maximum reasonable penalty as long as the agency did not indicate either in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges, <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1256-60 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Devall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 434 (1999)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board insists that we must find the scope of its mitigation authority under the Reform Act as extending to the point of allowing it to fashion--<span class="Italic">de novo</span>--a penalty that ignores entirely the penalty originally imposed by the agency. In essence, the Board urges us to defer to its reading of amended section 7701(b)(3) as containing an authority not merely to mitigate, but also to create.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such an interpretation would, however, empower the Board to act as judge in its own case, in direct conflict with the clear intent of Congress that managerial actions be exercised by one body and reviewed by another. To be sure, the Board inherited mitigation authority in misconduct actions from the old Civil Service Commission; but the extent of this inheritance must be assessed through the lens of the Reform Act itself and cannot conflict with one of its basic purposes, as the Board's interpretation would do....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board insists that our case law binds us to sanction its mitigation authority as encompassing independent penalty determination authority because we have previously so held. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board makes much of its statement in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> that "[w]henever the agency's action is based on multiple charges some of which are not sustained, the presiding official should consider carefully whether the sustained charges merited the penalty imposed by the agency," 5 MSPR at 308, and points to several of our cases as evidence that this court has adopted the "consider carefully" requirement. The Board opines that the phrase "consider carefully" reflects the Board's recognition that the agency has not made a determination of the appropriate penalty for only the sustained charges, and that simple deference to the imposed penalty is therefore inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We consider it curious that the Board equates such careful consideration with abrogation of the Board's admitted responsibility "to accord proper deference to the agency's primary discretion in managing its workforce" and thus "not to insist that the balanc[ing of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors] be struck precisely where the Board would choose to strike it if the Board were in the agency's shoes in the first instance." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306. We have never so equated the two, nor, before today, have we had occasion to consider the Board's view of its mitigation authority, whether under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> or <span class="Italic">White</span>. While we have acknowledged that "where many of the original charges are not sustained below" the prudence of an agency-imposed penalty must be "scrutinize[d] carefully," <span class="Italic">Quinton</span>, 808 F.2d at 829; <span class="Italic">see also Hagmeyer</span>, 757 F.2d at 1285 (commenting that under the circumstances of the case the presiding official ought to have "carefully consider[ed] " whether the single charge retained by the agency warranted the agency's so severe a sanction), our requirement for careful scrutiny merely reflected our requirement that the Board independently <span class="Italic">balance</span> the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors with heightened sensitivity when reviewing agency penalties upon fewer charges than those brought by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Quinton</span>, 808 F.2d at 829 (approving of the Board's proper independent balancing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in affirming the agency's penalty choice after reversing some charges); <span class="Italic">Webster v. Department of the Army</span>, 911 F.2d 679, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("We think a fair reading of the administrative judge's lengthy opinion as a whole demonstrates 'that the presiding official identified, balanced and then considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in determining that the sustained charge[s] warranted the penalty imposed.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Kline v. Department of Transportation</span>, 808 F.2d 43, 46 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); <span class="Italic">cf. Kline</span>, 808 F.2d at 46 (holding inadequate the Board's balancing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors after it sustained one of two agency charges, and remanding the case to the Board to "consider and balance those relevant factors in determining an appropriate penalty for the sustained charge of AWOL."); <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 567 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (same). These cases obviously contemplate Board authority to assess the penalty to be attached to conduct when fewer than all charges are sustained. They do not, however, address or resolve the question of whether the Board may ignore the agency's views when making such assessments. The case law, then, does not decide the issue now before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That the Board always should have independent balancing authority seems manifest in view of the Reform Act's purpose in creating the Board to "determin[e] whether [the civil service] system is free from abuse." S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 24, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN at 2476. That this balancing authority must be exercised with heightened scrutiny when the Board affirms an agency's penalty notwithstanding its reversal of some agency charges makes sense, because 5 USC 7513(b)(4) requires agencies taking adverse actions against their employees to indicate "the specific reasons therefor," a statutory requirement consistent with the Reform Act's goal of ensuring the exercise of managerial discretion for the right reasons. When the Board agrees with the agency's penalty assessment, yet repudiates some agency charges while sustaining others, the reasons provided by the agency for taking its action necessarily fall short of the virtual exactitude implicit in the phrase "specific reasons." Absent the articulation of specific reasons, agency action is ineffective as it does not comply with statutory requirements. To provide the requisite compliance efficiently, the Board steps in as surrogate to realign the precise correspondence between agency action and agency justification mandated by the statute. To effectuate this realignment, the Board cannot merely state that it agrees with the agency's specific reasons for the imposed penalty, however comprehensive they may be, for the exact correspondence between charges and reasons is lacking. The Board must instead itself precisely articulate the basis for upholding the agency's action. The active process inherent in the precise articulation of any justification as a matter of course requires "careful" scrutiny of the circumstances: thus, the need for, and legitimacy of, the Board's exercise of its balancing authority with aplomb.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, if proper justification does not emerge upon this careful scrutiny, the agency's penalty cannot be sustained. In such instances, the Board may mitigate an unreasonably severe agency penalty to bring the penalty within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Lachance v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 147 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1998). We have never opined, however, that upon doing so the Board may substitute its will for the agency's by stepping beyond independent justification--a power essentially coextensive with independent review--into the realm of independent management. We have instead repeatedly emphasized the agency's exclusive domain in disciplining its employees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("It is well established that the determination of the proper disciplinary action to be taken to promote the efficiency of the service is a matter peculiarly and necessarily within the discretion of the agency."). The Board itself has cautioned against its own encroachment on this realm:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Management of the federal workforce and maintenance of discipline among its members is not the Board's function. Any margin of discretion available to the Board in reviewing penalties must be exercised with appropriate deference to the primary discretion which has been entrusted to agency management, not to the Board. Our role in this area, as in others, is principally to assure that managerial discretion has been legitimately invoked and properly exercised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 300-01. As a matter of efficiency the Board may independently justify agency actions it finds warranted on independent review. It may likewise on such review independently reject those penalties it finds abusive. It may not, however, infringe upon an agency's exclusive domain as workforce manager, for to do so would frustrate the framework of the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">See Beard</span>, 801 F.2d at 1322 ("The conclusion that the Board is to review agency penalties under the abuse-of-discretion standard and not itself to determine the appropriate penalty comports with the language and purpose of the [Reform] Act and is consistent with settled principles of administrative law governing review of agency penalties."). When the Board deems it necessary to mitigate an agency penalty, or when it is instructed to do so by this court, it cannot <span id="Page_2339"></span>disconnect its penalty determination from the agency's managerial will.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board argues that dispensing with agency discretion when some agency charges are reversed makes sense because upon such partial reversal the nexus between the charges brought by the agency and the penalty imposed by the agency based on those charges necessarily has been severed. Once severed, the more efficient procedure, the Board contends, is to have the Board itself determine a reasonable penalty <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. Thus, as the Board would have it, its decision to reverse a relatively innocuous charge while sustaining 99 more egregious ones should automatically transfer to the Board, as a matter of efficiency, the unfettered discretion to impose a penalty without the least regard for the agency's wishes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this logic unpersuasive. When an agency brings several charges, some more and some less egregious, and the more egregious charges are sustained, it is reasonable to presume, absent agency indications to the contrary, that the agency itself would have imposed the same penalty on the basis of the sustained charges that it chose on the basis of the combined charges. The presumption is fortified, moreover, when the agency makes this clear before the Board, as in this case, where the deciding official testified to the effect that Mr. Devall's prior incidents, counseling, and awareness of the agency's policies on sexual harassment were aggravating factors that motivated his decision to remove Mr. Devall. In such cases it does not follow that the basis for the agency's penalty choice no longer exists. Thus, the Board's insistence that its decision to reverse some agency charges necessarily severs the nexus between the charges actually proved and the agency's chosen penalty is incorrect. While it is true that the Board's reversal of some agency charges severs the precise correspondence between the actually proved charges and the penalty justification therefor required by 5 USC 7513(b)(4), the Board may cure this problem, as discussed, by providing such justification. That the Board may provide the requisite justification does not, however, imply that the Board may independently institute a new penalty. The limits on the Board's mitigation authority imposed by the structure of the Reform Act require that a nexus between the agency's penalty choice and the Board's be maintained. The vitality of this structure is paramount to whatever sacrifice in efficiency that may result from maintenance of such nexus, which in any event would never require anything more than remand to the agency for redetermination of an appropriate penalty. As we have previously pointed out, that an administrative procedure is the more efficient is of no consequence when the procedure runs afoul of congressional will. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that Board could not review agency determination notwithstanding the possible efficiency of such review because "it is not for the board to supplant the remedies Congress expressly provided or create new remedies which it believes Congress overlooked.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having established that the Board may not independently determine penalties, we now turn to the issue of the scope of the Board's mitigation authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM insists that when the Board finds an agency's penalty too severe on the charges actually sustained the Board must always mitigate to the "maximum reasonable penalty," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the penalty relative to the agency's that brings the agency's penalty within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis v. Department of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 317, 320-21 (1981). We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board correctly points out, requiring the Board to always mitigate to the maximum reasonable penalty might result in the Board's mitigating to a more severe penalty on the sustained charges than the agency would have imposed in the first instance. Such was indeed the somewhat anomalous case of <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 173, 179 (1989), where the Board mitigated removal to a 60-day suspension and demotion as the maximum reasonable penalty, notwithstanding the deciding official's testimony that he would have imposed merely a 15-day suspension on the sustained charges. Under the framework of the Reform Act an agency cannot abdicate responsibility for managing its workforce by requiring imposition of the maximum reasonable penalty any time the Board finds the agency's penalty inappropriate. As <span class="Italic">Williams</span> illustrates, uniform imposition of a maximum reasonable penalty standard would sever the required nexus between agency and Board penalty actions as much as would allowing the Board independently to determine appropriate penalties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the following procedures will satisfy this required nexus: When the Board sustains all of an agency's charges the Board may mitigate the agency's original penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty when it finds the agency's original penalty too severe. When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, the Board may mitigate to the maximum reasonable penalty so long as the agency has not indicated either in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. Such a procedure ensures that the agency retains its authority under the Reform Act to serve as employee disciplinarian on the basis of its sustained charges: when the Board mitigates to the maximum reasonable penalty under such circumstances, the Board's action appropriately presumes that it is acting in conformity with the agency's penalty choice, either because the agency explicitly has made clear its desire that the maximum reasonable penalty be imposed or implicitly has done so by virtue of its silence. If the Board discerns from the record or the proceedings that the agency desires imposition of a lesser penalty the Board must accord the agency an opportunity to institute such a lesser penalty. The Board may do so either through remand, or through some other procedure pursuant to its rulemaking authority under 5 USC 7701(k) that would, for example, set some reasonable time limit for the agency to redetermine a penalty on the sustained charges so as to ensure that the agency has sufficient opportunity to consider its options, while also ensuring that resolution of an employee's case is not unduly prolonged. The legality of any such procedure under the Reform Act would, of course, be subject to our review.</p>

Mr. Tartaglia's request would have us fashion the precise penalty for his misconduct.

Dep't of Justice</span>, 384 F.3d 1342, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("Our precedent in <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>...requires that in such circumstances the case return to the [MSPB] rather than the agency." (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we vacate the Final Order of the MSPB and remand the case to the MSPB for determination under <span class="Italic">Lachance</span> of some penalty less than removal. We say "less than removal" because we conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, removal would be unreasonable and disproportionate to the relatively minor offense committed (i.e., running a personal errand using a government-owned vehicle), particularly in light of Mr. Tartaglia's total of nineteen years of combined military and civil service and the fact that he had not previously been charged with misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Zingg</span>, 388 F.3d at 843; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Pet'r's Br. 8 (stating that "Mr. <span id="Page_2340"></span>Tartaglia had no prior disciplinary record"); Resp't's Br. 11 (acknowledging Mr. Tartaglia's "lack of prior disciplinary history"). On remand, the MSPB will have the opportunity to determine the appropriate penalty for Mr. Tartaglia that is less than removal. <span class="Italic">See Hathaway</span>, 384 F.3d at 1353; <span class="Italic">see also Miguel v. Dep't of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (remanding "for...determination...of an appropriate lesser penalty" when a single charge against an employee was sustained but this court found the penalty of removal to be an abuse of discretion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tartaglia and LaChance</span> were followed, their significance reiterated, in <span class="Italic">Moreno v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211103203">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), involving AWOL-based removal that required greater scrutiny by the Board when not all charges against the appellant were sustained and when the agency did not indicate that it desired a lesser penalty to be imposed on the remaining charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We nonetheless vacate the penalty of removal and remand the case because the Board failed to provide a proper analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, it should determine the maximum reasonable penalty unless the agency has indicated that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999). In this case, the agency did not indicate that it desired a lesser penalty than removal in the event the Board sustained only the AWOL charge. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, the Board was in the position to determine the maximum reasonable penalty. We have held that where, as here, the Board must independently determine the penalty, the Board is required to independently balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Tartaglia v. Dep't of Veterans Affs.</span>, 858 F.3d 1405, 1408 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (explaining that the Board is required to independently balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors when reviewing agency penalties upon fewer charges than those brought by the agency) (citing <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 178 F.3d at 1257).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board failed to do so here. Under <span class="Italic">Lachance</span> and <span class="Italic">Tartaglia,</span> the Board should have independently considered all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including Ms. Moreno's potential for rehabilitation given that she had returned to work part-time, whether Ms. Moreno's medical conditions were a mitigating factor, and whether lesser sanctions than removal would have been adequate in Ms. Moreno's case. See <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. Dep't of Veterans Affs.,</span> 838 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Instead, the Board merely listed the factors the deciding official considered aggravating and those he considered mitigating. Rather than an independent analysis, the Board then summarily concluded that it "f[ound] nothing unreasonable in the deciding official's weighing of the factors pertinent to the penalty" and that "the absences pertinent to [the AWOL charge] suffice to render the agency's removal penalty within the bound of reasonableness." The Board's remarkably short and deferential analysis falls far short of what is required under our precedent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The law has come full circle. If not all charges are sustained, the Board imposes the maximum penalty within the parameters of reasonableness unless the agency states that it desires a lesser penalty to be imposed for fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Zayer v. VA</span>, 90 MSPR 51, 55 &#x00B6; 8 (2001); <span class="Italic">see Zwagil v. GSA,</span> 167 Fed. Appx. 801, 804 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) (if the Board discerns that the agency desires imposition of a lesser penalty when fewer than all charges are sustained, then the agency must have the opportunity to institute a less penalty; when, however, the agency has not indicated in its final decision or during proceedings before the Board that it desires a lesser penalty to be imposed on fewer charges, the Board may uphold the penalty if it regards that penalty as falling within the maximum reasonable penalty for the sustained charge), <span class="Italic">following remand, Zwagil v. GSA</span>, 103 MSPR 63, 2006 MSPB 235 (2006), <span class="Italic">post</span>. But the Board considers the circumstances, including the agency's approach to the case (initial suspension proposal replaced by a termination) and the appellant's circumstances (various medical problems) in deciding the penalty when not all charges are sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sinclair v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, AT-0752-16-0376-I-1 (NP 7/22/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Either through a decision or testimony, the agency deciding official who wishes to influence the outcome of an appeal should fewer than all charges be sustained must clearly state his intent, a situation that did not occur in<span class="Italic"> Brown v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-14-0816-I-1 (NP 1/19/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not challenge the administrative judge's decision to sustain only 2 of the 7 specifications in the submitting false reports charge, 7 of the 8 specifications of the failure to follow directions charge, and only 1 of the 5 specifications in the failure to exercise due diligence charge. We affirm her conclusions in this regard. The administrative judge's decision not to sustain all of the supporting specifications of each of the charges--and in particular, her decision to sustain relatively few of the specifications of the most serious charge--also calls into question the reasonableness of the agency's penalty. <span class="Italic">See Laniewicz</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 9. The deciding official testified that he would "consider" removal absent the submitting false reports charge and he would "look at" removal for the failure to exercise due diligence charge alone. However, he was not asked and he did not state what penalty he would levy if less than all of the specifications of each of the charges were sustained. The absence of such evidence counsels against a finding that the removal penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parker</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 510, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11-13 (affirming the agency's decision to demote the supervisor appellant because, among other things, the deciding official testified that his decision to impose the penalty of demotion "would have still been the same" even absent one of the specifications of the failure to follow instructions charge).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With all of this discussion, the result reached by the Federal Circuit and the Board is contrary to concepts of progressive, corrective, and rehabilitative discipline urged by many agencies' personnel manuals and union contracts. A penalty should be reasonable, and a reasonable penalty may, or may not be, the maximum penalty that could be sustained for a charge. The Board has plenty of experience with disciplinary cases over the decades of its existence. If management will not state in its decision letter than a given penalty--and that penalty will be the maximum reasonable penalty that an agency will call for--should be imposed if less than all charges are sustained, it makes little sense for the Board to make the assumption that a maximum penalty would have been imposed. Instead, the Board should make its own assessment of a reasonable penalty if the agency will not take the trouble to do so in its decision letter.</p>
