<h4 class="h4" id="sec4-28"><span class="space">3.</span> Management Rights Objection; Excessive Interference</h4>
<p class="noindent">The agency head may disapprove an agreement that is not in accordance with law. One law is 5 USC 7106, establishing management rights. Under negotiability law, an arrangement is contrary to law if it excessively interferes with management rights. [Refer to Chapter 5 subheading, "<a href="0100-2023-13-058.html#sec5-59">Excessive Interference</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-13-059.html#sec5-60"><span class="Italic">KANG</span></a>."] Although its course would be later altered through judicial review, in 2011, FLRA decided to alter course, and it determined that it would apply an "abrogation" rather than an "excessive interference" test in reviewing an agency head disapproval of an arrangements provision based on a management rights objection. FLRA reasoned that the appropriate time and place for application of the "excessive interference" test is during basic negotiations and related negotiability appeals. The change in the law--destined to be temporary--arose from disputed provisions, agreed by the parties and disapproved by the agency head, concerning establishment and communication of performance expectations as a condition of employee responsibility for meeting those expectations during details. The provisions, determined to be negotiable, served as the vehicle for transforming FLRA's negotiability analysis in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-109.html">65 FLRA 509</a>, 511-15 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting) (pet. for review dismissed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt v. FLRA</span>, 670 F.3d 1315 (D.C. Cir. 2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), although the abrogation review standard was set aside in the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13, 13-21 (D.C. Cir. 2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>. In the 2011 <span class="Italic">Bureau of Public Debt</span> decision, FLRA determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The provisions affect management's rights to direct employees and assign work. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute include the rights to supervise employees and to determine the quantity, quality, and timeliness of employees' work. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 44 FLRA 63, 68 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Local 3295</span>). The evaluation of employee performance is an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">POPA</span>, 48 FLRA at 142. Thus, proposals or provisions that prohibit management from holding employees accountable for work performance affect the rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Similarly, proposals or provisions that prohibit management from enforcing its established performance standards affect the rights to direct employees and assign work because they effectively alter the content of the standards. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA at 710.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the provisions would prohibit the Agency from holding an employee responsible for his or her performance expectations if those expectations have not been communicated to the employee in writing. As the provisions would prohibit management from holding employees accountable for work performance in these circumstances, we find that the provisions affect management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The provisions are appropriate arrangements.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">i. <span class="Italic">Revised Analytical Framework </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority currently analyzes whether a proposal or provision is an appropriate arrangement under the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this framework, the Authority first determines whether a proposal or provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617 (2003). To establish that a proposal or provision is an arrangement, a union must establish the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects that flow from the exercise of management's rights and demonstrate how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA 953, 959 (2010). Additionally, the claimed arrangement must be sufficiently tailored to compensate those employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>However, "[p]rophylactic" proposals or provisions will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to determine reliably which employees will be adversely affected by an agency action so as to draft a proposal or provision to apply only to those employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 959-60.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal or provision is an arrangement, then, under the Authority's current standard, the Authority determines whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it "excessively interferes" with management's rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In making this determination, the Authority balances the proposal's or provision's benefits to employees against its burdens on management. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we reexamine and revise the standard that we apply in the negotiability context for determining whether an agreed-upon contract provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Specifically, we will no longer assess whether an arrangement is appropriate by applying an excessive interference standard. Rather, we will assess whether the provision "abrogates"--i.e., waives--the management right(s) that the provision affects.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The excessive interference standard will continue to apply in negotiability cases involving contract proposals to which parties have not yet agreed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, it is well established that a bargaining proposal is outside the duty to bargain if it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 1226</span>, 62 FLRA 459, 462 (2008). However, as both the plain wording of the Statute and longstanding Authority precedent demonstrate, the mere fact that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain does not mean that it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the plain wording of the Statute, &#x00A7; 7117(c) of the Statute provides that an exclusive representative may file a negotiability appeal "if an agency involved in collective bargaining with [the] exclusive representative alleges that the <span class="Italic">duty to bargain </span>in good faith does not extend to any matter[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c) (emphasis added). By contrast, &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute, which sets forth the process of agency-head review, does not speak in terms of whether an agreed-upon contract provision is within the duty to bargain. Rather, it provides, in pertinent part, that where an agency and an exclusive representative have reached an agreement, "[t]he head of the agency shall approve the agreement...if the agreement is <span class="Italic">in accordance with the provisions of [the Statute]</span> <span class="Italic"> and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation </span>(unless the agency has granted an exception to the provision)." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that where Congress uses different terms in different parts of a statute, there is a presumption that Congress "did not view the two terms as being identical." <span class="Italic">U.S. SEC, Wash. D.C.</span>, 61 FLRA 251, 255 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Recording Indus. Ass'n of Am. v. Verizon Internet Serv.</span>, 351 F.3d 1229, 1235 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). That Congress did not state that an agency head may disapprove matters that are outside the "duty to bargain" is therefore significant. Put simply, Congress recognized that a matter may be outside the duty to bargain but, once agreed upon, may not be subject to agency-head disapproval unless it is contrary to the Statute or any other law, rule, or regulation. Further, the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) states that an agency head "shall"--i.e., has no discretion not to--approve an agreed-upon contract provision unless that contract provision is contrary to the Statute or any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to Authority precedent, consistent with the foregoing, the Authority has long held that the scope of what an agency head may disapprove is more limited than the scope of the duty to bargain. In this regard, in <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Government Employees, Local R4-75</span>, 24 FLRA 56 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-75</span>), the Authority stated that &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute "strictly limits the occasions in which the head of the agency may invalidate an agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 61 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 850, 859 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). Specifically, the Authority found that, unless a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute is "otherwise inconsistent with applicable law, rule, or regulation," an agency head may not disapprove the provision because, in such circumstance, the provision is "not inconsistent with the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 62. Consistent with <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R4-75</span>, and with the statutory wording discussed above, the Authority has held that although a matter may be a permissive subject of bargaining--and an agency may not be required to bargain over it--it may not be disapproved on agency-head review unless it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NATCA, AFL-CIO</span>, 61 FLRA 336, 339 (2005) (provision regarding supervisory conditions of employment, a matter not within the duty to bargain, may not be disapproved on agency-head review); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 338 (same with regard to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) matter); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Mint Council</span>, 41 FLRA 1004, 1010 (1991) (agency-head review serves "limited purpose" of ensuring that contract provisions are not contrary to law, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, although a particular proposal may be outside the duty to bargain because it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation, an agreed-upon contract provision is not contrary to law, rule, or regulation merely because, at the bargaining table, it was outside the duty to bargain.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Accordingly, the dissent's statement that the concept of a subject being contrary to the Statute "<span class="Italic">includes</span>" the concept of being <span id="Page_416"></span>outside the duty to bargain is backwards; the former is narrower than the latter. Further, the dissent's references to "a proposal [that] proceeds to agency head review," and "a provisionally-agreed-to proposal[,]" mischaracterize <span class="Italic">provisions</span>, which are part of <span class="Italic">contracts </span>that may be disapproved only on limited grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has acknowledged this difference in the context of contract provisions that affect management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. In this connection, in <span class="Italic">United States Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 65 FLRA 113 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>), the Authority addressed whether an arbitration award was contrary to management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. The Authority stated that "the Statute recognizes that agency management is permitted to agree to a broader range of matters than those strictly within its duty to bargain[,]" and "[n]o basis [was] provided to conclude that the situation is any different when management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are involved." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 118. Further, acknowledging that &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute charges the Authority with setting aside arbitration awards if they are "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation[,]" <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 114, the Authority found it appropriate, in assessing whether an arbitrator is enforcing an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, to apply a different standard than the Authority applies when determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain. Specifically, rather than applying the "excessive interference" standard that the Authority has applied in the negotiability context--which involves assessing whether a proposal's burdens on management rights outweigh the proposal's benefits to employees--the Authority found that a contractual arrangement that does not "abrogate"--i.e., waive--a management right is not contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 119.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although <span class="Italic">EPA </span>involved Authority review of exceptions to an arbitration award, rather than a negotiability appeal involving agency-head disapproval of contract provisions, the pertinent wording of &#x00A7; 7122(a) (governing Authority review of arbitration awards) is substantively identical to the wording in &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) (governing agency-head review of agreements). Specifically, as stated previously, &#x00A7; 7122(a) provides that the Authority shall set aside an arbitration award if it is "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation[,]" and &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) provides that an agency head shall approve an agreement if the agreement is "in accordance with the provisions of [the Statute] and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation...." Thus, if a contract provision enforced by an arbitrator is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, then it cannot be disapproved by an agency head on the basis of &#x00A7; 7106. Consistent with this principle, as a contractual arrangement that does not abrogate a management right is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 in the arbitration context, <span class="Italic">see EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 118, it necessarily follows that an agency head may not rely on &#x00A7; 7106 to disapprove such an arrangement.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Authority did not identify as a relevant factor whether the agency head had timely disapproved the agreement. In fact, the Authority expressly stated that its analysis "call[ed] into question whether abrogation also should be the standard applied in negotiability cases involving contract provisions (where agreement has been reached and subsequently disapproved), rather than proposals." 65 FLRA at 118 n.11. The dissent concurred in <span class="Italic">EPA </span>and "applaud[ed]" the majority's decision to abandon the excessive interference standard; unlike the majority, however, the dissent would not "engage in <span class="Italic">any </span>assessment of whether a contract provision that is being enforced by an arbitrator violates management's rights." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 119. In other words, in the arbitration context, the dissent would find that there is <span class="Italic">no </span>level of interference with a management right--whether excessive interference or abrogation--that renders a provision unenforceable as long as parties have agreed to it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In addition, the dissent's reliance on <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Local 2782</span>), and <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 850 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>), is misplaced. <span class="Italic">Local 2782 </span>involved an assessment of whether proposals were within the duty to bargain--not whether agreed-upon provisions were enforceable--and expressly left it "for the Authority to determine in the first instance[&#8197;]" the meaning of the word "appropriate" in &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). 702 F.2d at 1188. <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>held only that the Authority reasonably had determined that an agency head may disapprove a contract that is contrary to law, rule, or regulation, even if that contract had been imposed by the Federal Service Impasses Panel (the Panel). Nothing in this decision is inconsistent with this principle, as we continue to find, consistent with <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, that an arrangement that does not abrogate a management right is an appropriate arrangement and, thus, <span class="Italic">not </span>contrary to law, rule, or regulation. In addition, although the court in <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>stated that the purpose of agency head review is simply "to allow the head of the agency an extra [thirty] days to do that which his subordinates could have done earlier," 778 F.2d at 860 n.16, it did not hold that the scope of matters that an agency head may properly disapprove is coextensive with the scope of matters that may be declared outside the duty to bargain at the bargaining table. In fact, in dicta, the court stated that "an argument can be made that Congress'[&#8197;] explicit policy to allow the head of an agency to invalidate an agreement may have even stronger justifications for terms imposed by the...Panel, than for those negotiated by the parties[,]" because "[i]n the latter case, the agency's own authorized representative has agreed to the terms." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 858. In other words, the court acknowledged that the parties' agreement to a provision at the bargaining table may be a relevant consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decision to apply an "abrogation" standard in the arbitration context was based, in large part, on a policy of deferring to bargaining parties' choices. In this regard, in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Authority reiterated that, during bargaining, the parties' representatives are authorized to, and should, assess the burdens that a proposal would have on management rights and the benefits that the proposal would afford employees. <span class="Italic">See </span>65 FLRA at 117 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 57 FLRA 158, 162 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting) (<span class="Italic">BOP, Okla. City</span>)). Specifically, the Authority stated that bargaining parties should assess "what provisions best fit their working conditions and what arrangements are 'appropriate.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">BOP, Okla. City</span>, 57 FLRA at 162). The Authority also stated that this policy reflected a "justifiable reluctance" on the part of the Authority to substitute its judgment for that of the parties who have negotiated an agreement. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has deferred to bargaining parties' choices in the negotiability context as well. For example, in negotiability disputes involving agreed-upon contract provisions, the Authority defers to the parties who negotiated the provision--not the agency head--when assessing the provision's meaning. <span class="Italic">See IBEW, Local 350</span>, 55 FLRA 243, 244 (1999) (deferring to the meaning provided by "the parties who agreed on the provision"). In addition, the Authority has held that a contract becomes effective even where an agency has not timely submitted the contract for agency-head review under &#x00A7; 7114(c) or where the agency head does not disapprove (or timely disapprove) a provision. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 44 FLRA 926, 938-40 (1992). This recognizes that the bargaining parties' choices can have binding effects, without regard to the potential concerns of agency heads. Of course, a contract that becomes effective in these circumstances does so "subject to the provisions of [the Statute] and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3). In that situation, as noted above, the provision is enforceable in arbitration unless it abrogates a management right.[7] <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 118.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;As noted above, such provision is enforceable, in the dissent's view, even if it abrogates a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Deferring to the bargaining parties' choices and applying an "abrogation" standard in cases where the parties have agreed to contract provisions also is consistent with the Statute's requirement that agencies "be represented at...negotiations by duly authorized representatives prepared to discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(2). In this connection, &#x00A7; 7114(b)(2) recognizes that agencies are required to provide bargaining representatives who adequately represent management's interests at the bargaining table <span class="Italic">before </span>any agreement is reached. Thus, if a union proposal would impose burdens on an agency that the agency deems excessive, then those burdens should be assessed during negotiations--not after the parties have reached agreement.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;There is no basis for the dissent's speculation about what will occur under this revised approach; specifically, that agency heads will be more likely to get directly involved in collective bargaining, which, in turn, will impede the bargaining process. As an initial matter, parties already have the ability to reach binding agreements with regard to a wide range of permissive subjects of bargaining--including, but not limited to, "the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty," and "the technology, methods, and means of performing work[,]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1)--and there is no evidence that this has resulted in the situation that the dissent predicts. In addition, there is no reasonable basis for finding that local agency representatives routinely fail to object to union proposals on management-rights grounds--as evidenced by the plethora of Authority negotiability decisions in the past two years alone that have involved local agency negotiators declaring bargaining proposals outside the duty to bargain on those grounds. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 221</span>, 64 FLRA 1153, 1155 (2010); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345</span>, 64 FLRA 949, 950 (2010); <span class="Italic">United Am.

This is in stark contrast to the two negotiability decisions in the past two years that have involved agency-head disapproval of contracts on management-rights grounds. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA 953, 955 (2010); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Emps. Org., </span>63 FLRA 450, 451 (2009). Further, although the dissent states that the Authority has not yet found that a contract provision abrogates a management right, if this proves anything at all, then it proves that parties are sufficiently sophisticated so as not to agree to contract provisions that abrogate management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, in this and in future cases, we will find that a contractual arrangement is an "appropriate" arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute--and that an agency head may not disapprove such an arrangement on &#x00A7; 7106 grounds--unless the arrangement abrogates, or waives, a management right. Previous Authority decisions to the contrary will no longer be followed. In determining whether a contract provision abrogates a management right, we will assess whether the contract provision "precludes [the] agency from exercising" the affected management right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 171, 174 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">Judicial review of the <span class="Italic">Bureau of Pub. Debt</span> decision was sought but denied in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt v. FLRA</span>, 670 F.3d 1315, 1316-21 (D.C. Cir. 2012), because the agency did not raise issue with the abrogation standard before FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Department of the Treasury (Department) petitions for review of a decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA, Authority) that adopted a new standard to determine when a negotiated contract provision is an "appropriate arrangement" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and an agency head's disapproval thereof will therefore be set aside. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. 509 (2011). Because the Department did not object to the new standard before the Authority--as required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c)--we dismiss the Department's petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Negotiators for the Department's Bureau of Public Debt (BPD) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) signed a new collective bargaining agreement on April 7, 2010. The agreement was submitted to the agency head for review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c), which provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)(1) An agreement between any agency and an exclusive representative shall be subject to approval by the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The head of the agency shall approve the agreement within 30 days from the date the agreement is executed if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation (unless the agency has granted an exception to the provision).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the head of the agency does not approve or disapprove the agreement within the 30-day period, the agreement shall take effect and shall be binding on the agency and the exclusive representative subject to the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency head disapproved the agreement on May 7, 2010, finding that sixty-two of its provisions "d[id] not conform to law, rule, or regulation." Memorandum for Angela Jones, Human Resource Officer, BPD, from Nicole A. Johnson, Associate Chief Human Capital Officer for Human Capital Strategic Management, U.S. Department of the Treasury (May 7, 2010) (JA 7). Before NTEU petitioned the FLRA for review of the disapproval, the parties reduced the number of disputed provisions to fifty-five, of which only three now remain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each of the first two disputed provisions sets out a performance-appraisal process for BPD employees who are detailed or temporarily promoted for fewer than 120 days, requiring, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "performance expectations shall be confirmed in writing by the temporary supervisor before the employee can be held responsible for such performance expectations." <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 509-10. The third disputed provision requires that a BPD employee who abuses emergency annual leave be "counseled concerning such abuse" before he may be disciplined therefor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 515. The agency head determined each of the provisions was nonnegotiable because it interfered with a management right accorded a federal agency under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2), namely the rights to direct and to discipline employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> Statement of Agency Position, Legal Analysis, NTEU, Case No. 0-NG-3076, at 3, 5 (FLRA July 6, 2010) (JA 125, 127) (performance-appraisal provisions "not negotiable" because each "imposes a burden on management's right to direct employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 7 (JA 129) (leave abuse provision "not negotiable because it excessively interferes with management's right to discipline under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act (Act), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, generally requires a federal agency to bargain in good faith with a public employee union over conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Ass'n of Civilian Techs. v. FLRA,</span> 534 F.3d 772, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 550 F.3d 1148, 1150 (D.C. Cir. 2008). Section 7106(a), however, exempts certain "management rights"--such as the duties to direct and discipline employees--from the agency's duty to bargain, making them ordinarily nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 550 F.3d at 1150. Section 7106(b) nonetheless requires an agency to bargain over a proposal that affects a management right if the proposal constitutes an "'appropriate arrangement[&#8197;] for employees adversely affected' by the exercise of management rights." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps., Inc. v. FLRA,</span> 179 F.3d 946, 948 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA uses a two-part test to determine whether a negotiated provision is an "appropriate arrangement" subject to bargaining notwithstanding it affects a protected management right. First, the Authority considers whether the provision is "intended to be an 'arrangement' for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right" guaranteed under section 7106(a)(2); if so, it next evaluates whether the arrangement is appropriate within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) 2 and therefore subject to bargaining. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 437 F.3d 1248, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Until now, the Authority has made the second determination using an "excessive interference" standard, i.e., finding a negotiated provision to be inappropriate if it "'excessively interferes' with management's rights" as enumerated in section 7106(a). <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 511 (quoting <span class="Italic">Am Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 1770,</span> 64 F.L.R.A. 953, 959 (2010)).[3] In this case, however, relying on its recent decision <span class="Italic">in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. 113 (2010), in which it replaced the excessive interference standard with an "abrogation" standard when reviewing arbitral awards,[4] the Authority similarly substituted the abrogation standard for review of an agency head's disapproval of a negotiated agreement. Under the abrogation standard, the Authority "will find that a contractual arrangement is an 'appropriate' arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)...--and that an agency head may not disapprove such an arrangement on &#x00A7; 7106 grounds--unless the arrangement abrogates, or waives, a management right," that is, unless it "'precludes [the] agency from exercising' the affected management right." 65 F.L.R.A. at 515 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. 171, 174 (2010)). Finding that the three contested provisions "limit" management's ability to exercise its rights but "do not preclude" their exercise altogether, two of the Authority's members concluded the provisions "are appropriate arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)" and are therefore "not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B)" nor subject to agency head disapproval. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 515. Accordingly, the Authority majority ordered the Department to "rescind its disapproval of the provisions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 519. The third member dissented from the majority's adoption of the abrogation standard and would have applied the excessive interference standard to invalidate the provisions as inappropriate arrangements.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Authority adopted the "excessive interference" in 1983 in response to our decision in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA,</span> 702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983). There, we rejected the Authority's use of a "direct interference" test (making inappropriate any arrangement that directly interferes with a management right, regardless of the degree of interference) but we observed: "To say that the word 'appropriate' (in the phrase "appropriate arrangements" of paragraph (b)(3)) cannot bear this much weight is not to say that it can bear no weight at all. Undoubtedly, some arrangements may be inappropriate because they impinge upon management prerogatives <span class="Italic">to an excessive degree</span>." 702 F.2d at 1188 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Over twenty years ago, the Authority adopted the abrogation standard in reviewing arbitral awards, <span class="Italic">see Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv.,</span> 37 F.L.R.A. 309, 313-14 (1990), but returned to the excessive interference standard in 2002. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons,</span> 58 F.L.R.A. 109, 115 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority majority premised its adoption of the abrogation standard on the "plain wording" of the Act, contrasting the language of section 7114(c)(2)--which requires that an agency head approve a negotiated agreement "if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of this <span id="Page_418"></span>chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation"--with that of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c)--which authorizes a union to appeal to the Authority an agency's claim that "the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter." 65 F.L.R.A. at 512. It determined that the difference between the two italicized phrases meant they were intended to bear different meanings so that a proposal's subject matter may be outside the duty to bargain (and therefore subject to negotiability challenge under section 7117(c)) and yet still be "in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation" and therefore not subject to disapproval by the agency head. Relying on its decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA,</span> it then concluded a contract provision is not contrary to section 7106--and therefore may not be disapproved by the agency head on that basis--unless it <span class="Italic">abrogates</span> a management right accorded thereunder. The dissenting member responded that a proposal that is prohibited by section 7106(a) because it "impermissibly interferes with a management right" may "properly be characterized as being <span class="Italic">both</span> outside the duty to bargain and not 'in accordance with the provisions of [the Act]'" so as to be "subject to agency head rejection under &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2)." 65 F.L.R.A. at 521 (Member Beck dissenting) (emphasis in original) (alteration added). The dissent also questioned the logic of "applying a different test for negotiability at the stage of agency head review than is applied at bargaining table." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We express no opinion on the merits of the abrogation standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department filed a timely petition for review.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before reaching the merits of the Department's arguments, we must satisfy ourselves that we have subject-matter jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Chamber of Commerce v. EPA,</span> 642 F.3d 192, 199 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't.,</span> 523 U.S. 83 (1998)). Intervenor NTEU contests the court's jurisdiction on the ground the Department did not challenge the Authority's use of the abrogation standard before the Authority itself as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). We agree with NTEU that we lack subject matter jurisdiction under section 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7123(c) provides: "No objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." Where, as here, the Authority raises an issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>in its decision, section 7123(c) "precludes us from considering a pertinent objection if the petitioner has not raised the objection before the Authority in a request for reconsideration." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps., Local R5-136 v. FLRA,</span> 363 F.3d 468, 479 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce v. FLRA,</span> 7 F.3d 243, 245-46 (D.C. Cir. 1993));<span class="Italic"> see </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.17 (authorizing motion for reconsideration). The Department acknowledges it failed to move for reconsideration of the new abrogation standard but argues the omission should be excused for three reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Department invokes the "futility" exception to section 7123(c) which applies "when a request for reconsideration would be 'patently futile' in light of recent Authority decisions squarely addressing the issue in question." <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> 363 F.3d at 479. In particular, the Department relies on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA </span>in which "the Authority decided to return to the 'abrogation' standard, which had been used from 1990 to 2002, to decide cases involving the review of arbitration decisions under Section 7122(a)." According to the Department, "in <span class="Italic">EPA</span> the Authority had already made up its mind that it would apply 'abrogation' in the agency head review context, and no motion for reconsideration would have budged the Authority from that position." The Department overstates the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span>. There, the Authority simply "note[d] that [its] analysis call[ed] into question whether abrogation also should be the standard applied in negotiability cases involving contract provisions (where agreement has been reached and subsequently disapproved)." <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 118 n.11 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons,</span> 57 F.L.R.A. 158, 162 (2001)). Because <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span> involved review of an arbitration and not of an agency head disapproval, the Authority expressly "le[ft] [the question] for another day." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span> did not, as the Department claims, "squarely address[&#8197;]" what standard applies to review of an agency head disapproval or indicate it had "already made up its mind" on the issue. Given the different contexts and the Authority's tentative tone in <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA,</span> we cannot conclude it would have been patently futile for the Department to file the required reconsideration motion here. <span class="Italic">Cf. W &#x0026; M Props. of Conn., Inc. v. NLRB,</span> 514 F.3d 1341, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (to establish patent futility as "extraordinary circumstance[&#8197;]" excusing failure to move for reconsideration under analogous provision of National Labor Relations Act, petitioner must "show that a motion for reconsideration was 'clearly doomed' by the agency's rejection of identical arguments" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA,</span> 2 F.3d 1190, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reconsideration motion challenging Authority's determination that proposal was arrangement would have been futile where it "seem[ed] clear that the FLRA would have rejected" it given Authority had "repeatedly held negotiable" similar proposals, "including two proposals that [court] view[ed] as <span class="Italic">indistinguishable</span>" from proposal at issue (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 969 F.2d 1158, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (reconsideration motion disputing proposal was arrangement "would have been futile given that the Authority had just found an <span class="Italic">identical</span> proposal negotiable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department also argues that moving for reconsideration would have been futile in light of the "vigorous" dissent, which argued the Department's case for it--albeit to no avail. The Department acknowledges that we considered and rejected the same argument in <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> 363 F.3d at 479-80; it attempts to distinguish this case, however, based on its "facts," asserting that "[f]utility is a case-by-case matter." According to the Department, <span class="Italic">Local R5-136</span> "made the point that a dissenting opinion does not automatically satisfy Section 7123(c)'s requirements because a party must make clear to the Authority what its own arguments are" but, the Department argues, such "guidance" is inapplicable here because "the dissent raised <span class="Italic">all</span> of the issues that the agency could have raised." In <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> however, we rejected the petitioners' futility claim not only because it "presuppose[d] that a party's <span class="Italic">position</span> is always coterminous with a dissenting opinion" but also because it "appear[ed] to assume that the <span class="Italic">persuasive power</span> of a party's argument can never exceed the quality of a dissenting opinion," <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> 363 F.3d at 479 (emphases added)--a consideration that applies whether or not the substance of the party's arguments would have mirrored the dissent's. Because the Department made no objection to the new standard before the Authority, we cannot know how persuasive its hypothetical arguments might have been. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> based on both the need to hear from the parties themselves and our precedent interpreting "virtually identical" language in the National Labor Relations Act, we did more than simply offer "guidance"--we established a jurisdictional prerequisite, stating: "Section 7123(c) <span class="Italic">requires a party</span> to present its own views to the Authority in order to preserve a claim for judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Contractors' Labor Pool, Inc. v. NLRB,</span> 323 F.3d 1051, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (interpreting 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(e)) (emphasis added). Because the Department ignored this jurisdictional requirement, the Authority was left to make its decision and articulate its rationale without the views of either the Department or NTEU. For these reasons, here, as in <span class="Italic">Local R5-136,</span> "the dissent below did not excuse the [agency's] failure to raise its objections in a request for reconsideration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 480.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Department asserts that the FLRA's "failure to challenge the Court's jurisdiction here reflects the Authority's apparent agreement with the agency that a motion for reconsideration would have been futile." We decline to draw so speculative an inference from the Authority's silence; in fact, at oral argument counsel for the FLRA assured the court its silence manifested no such agreement. In any event, the Authority can no more divine how it might have reacted to arguments not made than can the party that did not make them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Department's claim of "extraordinary circumstance" based on its assertions that (1) the abrogation standard will inevitably come up for review in "the very next agency head review case" and (2) "delay in resolving the issue will only cause confusion and uncertainty." As an initial matter, the cited circumstances seem anything but "extraordinary"--they are, we think, a commonplace of litigation. Moreover, that the issue will arise again soon--and likely be resolved when it does--argues against the need for an irregular, accelerated resolution in this proceeding. Any "confusion and uncertainty" resulting from our adherence to section 7123(c)'s jurisdictional requirement will be speedily dispelled should the issue again arise in "the very next agency head review case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Department failed to move for reconsideration objecting to the Authority's use of the abrogation standard to review the agency head's disapproval of the negotiated agreement, we dismiss the Department's petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">But the issue of the proper standard for agency head review did not disappear. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 739 F.3d 13, 14-21 (D.C. Cir. 2014), the D.C. Circuit declared arbitrary and unenforceable FLRA's creation of two standards--abrogation and excessive interference--to apply to the same negotiability test administered at different steps of the bargaining process. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury</span> left intact FLRA's <span class="Italic">KANG</span> excessive interference test for agency head review of contract provisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7106(b)(3) of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., provides that collective bargaining agreements reached between federal agencies and their employees' bargaining representatives may contain provisions that, although interfering with certain managerial prerogatives, constitute "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise" of such management rights. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). In determining whether a given "arrangement[&#8197;]" is "appropriate," the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("the Authority")--which is charged with administering the FSLMRS--has, depending on how the issue comes before it, applied two different substantive tests that might yield different results for the very same arrangement. As explained in this opinion, by adopting two inconsistent interpretations of the same statutory language, the Authority has acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS establishes the framework governing labor-management relations in the federal government. The statute requires federal agencies and labor organizations representing their employees to "meet and negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective <span id="Page_419"></span>bargaining agreement," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4), and sets forth various requirements for both the bargaining process and the content of any agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue here is section 7106 of the Act.&#x2003;Section 7106(a) provides: "Subject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in [the FSLMRS] shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency" to exercise certain management rights, which include the authority to "hire, assign, direct, layoff, and retain employees in the agency, or to suspend, remove, reduce in grade or pay, or take other disciplinary action against such employees," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A), and "to assign work, to make determinations with respect to contracting out, and to determine the personnel by which agency operations shall be conducted," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). Section 7106(b), in turn, provides in relevant part that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating," among other things, "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7106(b), (b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We addressed the interaction between sections 7106(a) and 7106(b)(3) in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1983) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>"). There the Authority had held that any "arrangement" that interferes with the management rights set forth in section 7106(a) was necessarily not "appropriate" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1185-86. Rejecting this reading, we explained that section 7106(b)(3) establishes "an <span class="Italic">exception</span> to the otherwise governing management prerogative requirements of subsection (a)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1187. Thus, the provision contemplates that the management rights set forth in section 7106(a) will give way, to some extent, to "appropriate arrangements" for adversely affected employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Finding that an arrangement is inappropriate simply because it interferes with the enumerated management rights would, we concluded, render the section 7106(b)(3) exception entirely meaningless. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1188. We observed, however, that "some arrangements may be inappropriate because they impinge upon management prerogatives <span class="Italic">to an excessive degree</span>," and we declined to "speculate as to what the word 'appropriate' may lawfully be interpreted to exclude." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly for the issue before us, questions regarding section 7106's application may come before the Authority in at least three ways. First, an agency may assert during collective bargaining that a particular union proposal falls outside the agency's duty to bargain because it would contravene section 7106. Agencies are not required to bargain over all issues relating to conditions of employment, but may instead declare a particular union proposal to be "nonnegotiable" if, for example, the proposal would be "inconsistent with any 'Federal law or any government-wide rule or regulation.'" <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 778 F.2d 850, 852 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ("<span class="Italic">AFGE II</span>") (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1)). The union may seek expedited review of such nonnegotiability determinations before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c). Second, any agreement ultimately reached between the agency's bargaining representatives and the union is "subject to approval by the head of the agency," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(1), with such approval required "if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of [the FSLMRS] and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). An agency head may reject a provision on the ground that it contravenes section 7106, a decision the union may then appeal to the Authority. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E). Third, an agency might take exception to a provision imposed in arbitration, asserting before the Authority that the arbiter's award violates section 7106. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a series of decisions, the Authority has delineated the substantive tests it will use in each of these three sorts of appeals to determine what constitutes a section 7106(b)(3) "appropriate arrangement[&#8197;]." Following our decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, the Authority first addressed the issue in <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Government Employees, Local R14-87</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 24 (1986) ("<span class="Italic">KANG</span>"), a case that arose in the context of an agency head's determination under section 7114(c) that a collective bargaining provision was impermissible. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 24. The Authority adopted what it characterized as the "excessive interference test enunciated" in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In this and future cases where the Authority addresses a management allegation that a union proposal of appropriate arrangements is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with management rights..., the Authority will consider whether such an arrangement is appropriate for negotiation within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) or[&#8197;] whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 30-31. The Authority went on to describe the factors it would consider in evaluating whether a given arrangement "excessively interferes," among them whether the "negative impact on management's rights [is] disproportionate to the benefits to be derived from the proposed arrangement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Soon thereafter, the Authority applied the same "excessive interference" test in a case that arose in the context of a union's appeal from an agency declaration during collective bargaining that a particular proposal was nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 178, 186 &#x0026; n.2 (1986) ("<span class="Italic">Local 1923</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the Authority has treated somewhat differently agency claims that a provision in an arbitrator's award impermissibly interferes with management rights and should be set aside as "contrary to...law" pursuant to section 7122(a)(1). Although initially applying the "excessive interference" test in such cases, <span class="Italic">see Washington Plate Printers Union Local No. 2</span>, 31 F.L.R.A. 1250, 1256 (1988), the Authority later changed course, holding that only when an award "abrogates" a management right--which occurs when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" the right--would the Authority grant the agency relief, <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 309, 314 (1990). After some further oscillation, <span class="Italic">see Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 58 F.L.R.A. 109, 110 (2002) (returning to the "excessive interference" test), the Authority eventually settled on this "abrogation" standard, <span class="Italic">see U.S. EPA</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. 113, 116-17 (2010) ("<span class="Italic">EPA</span>").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then, overruling its prior decision in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, the Authority extended this "abrogation" test to appeals brought when an agency head disapproves a provision under section 7114(c). <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. 509, 512 (2011) ("<span class="Italic">NTEU I</span>"). The Authority made clear, however, that it would continue to apply the "excessive interference" standard when, during bargaining, an agency asserts that a proposal is nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 512 n.4. Member Beck dissented, contending, among other things, that the Authority had no basis for holding that "the same proposal that is legally invalid if it 'excessively interferes' with management rights at the bargaining table magically becomes valid and binding when it lands on the agency head's desk." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 519 (Beck, M., dissenting). The Department of the Treasury, petitioner here, sought review, but we dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction because Treasury had failed to properly present its arguments to the Authority. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 670 F.3d 1315, 1316 (D.C. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arose after the IRS Office of Chief Counsel--a component of Treasury--and the National Treasury Employees Union renegotiated their collective bargaining agreement. Reviewing the agreement pursuant to section 7114(c), the agency head found eight provisions contrary to law. The only provision still at issue here governs sick leave. The agency head contended that this provision--whose details are unimportant to the issue before us--impermissibly interfered with management's right to discipline employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Authority found in favor of the union, ordering Treasury to rescind its disapproval of the sick leave provision. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 809, 813 (2012) ("<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>"). The Authority agreed with the agency that the provision affected the management right to discipline secured by section 7106(a). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 812. But applying its newly-adopted "abrogation" standard--and rejecting Treasury's argument that it should return to the "excessive-interference" standard, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 812 n.8--the Authority concluded that the provision was an "appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 813. It reasoned that the "provision merely limits the circumstances in which management may exercise its right to discipline; it does not preclude the Agency from exercising that right." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 812. It rebuffed Treasury's reliance on two prior Authority decisions, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 858</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. 1169 (1991), and <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1156</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. 1157 (1991), which had found that similar sick leave provisions were not "appropriate arrangements," explaining that in those cases it had "applied an excessive-interference standard, rather than an abrogation standard." <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 812. Member Beck again dissented for the reasons given in his <span class="Italic">NTEU I</span> dissent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 815-16 (Beck, M., dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Treasury now petitions for review, contending that the Authority's decision to continue applying two different legal standards in assessing whether a section 7106(b)(3) "arrangement[&#8197;]" is "appropriate" is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A) (an agency decision may be set aside if it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law"); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> &#x00A7; 7123(c) (adopting section 706's arbitrary and capricious standard for judicial review of FLRA decisions). Although we generally defer to the Authority's reading of the FSLMRS, <span class="Italic">see Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984), under the arbitrary and capricious standard, we may affirm the Authority's interpretation and application of its governing statute only if it has "provide[d] a rational explanation for its decision." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter v. FLRA</span>, 370 F.3d 1214, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the Authority has failed to satisfy that obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding to apply an "abrogation" standard in some circumstances and an "excessive interference" standard in others, the Authority invoked nothing in section 7106(b)(3)'s text. Instead, it concluded that using these different standards was justified by the distinction between, on the one <span id="Page_420"></span>hand, the text of the statutory provisions governing agency-head review of collective bargaining agreements and agency challenges to arbitration awards, and, on the other hand, the text of the provision governing an agency's power to declare a union proposal nonnegotiable during collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. at 512-13. Specifically, both section 7114(c)(2), governing agency-head review, and section 7122(a)(1), governing exceptions to arbitration awards, are phrased in terms of a provision's consistency with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2) (agency head "shall approve" agreement reached by collective bargaining representatives if "the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of [the FSLMRS] and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) (FLRA may set aside arbitration award if it is "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation"). By contrast, section 7117(c), which governs an agency's authority to refuse to bargain over a proposed provision, speaks in terms of the agency's "duty to bargain," not the provision's legality. The language of these subsections, the Authority reasoned, demonstrates that "the mere fact that a proposal is outside the duty to bargain does not mean that it is contrary to law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 512. That distinction, the Authority continued, in turn justifies applying two different standards when evaluating whether an arrangement qualifies as "appropriate" under 7106(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 512-13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is true, as the Authority asserts, that certain provisions that fall outside the duty to bargain would not, if agreed to, be contrary to law. The Authority generally designates such matters as "permissive" subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 512; <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. at 119 n.12. Thus, for example, an agency has no obligation to bargain over proposals relating to the conditions of supervisors' employment because the duty to bargain extends only to bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment, and supervisors are outside the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See International Ass'n of Fire Fighters Local F-61</span>, 3 F.L.R.A. 437, 444-45 (1980). But because nothing in the statute prohibits the agency from negotiating over such matters, the Authority has held that an agency nonetheless may engage in collective bargaining regarding the conditions of supervisory employment if it so chooses. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees Local 3302</span>, 52 F.L.R.A. 677, 681-82 (1996); <span class="Italic">but see U.S. Department of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1441 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (suggesting that permitting the "union to seek to regulate, through collective bargaining, the conditions of employment of employees in other bargaining units and management personnel (who are excluded by the FSLMRS from membership in any bargaining unit)...is flatly at odds with both the FSLMRS and the [National Labor Relations Act]"). Likewise, section 7106(b)(1) expressly identifies certain matters that, although interfering with section 7106(a) management rights, may nonetheless be negotiated "at the election of the agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). Accordingly, an agency's bargaining representatives could elect to negotiate over and agree to a proposal regarding matters set forth in section 7106(b)(1) that, while outside the duty to bargain, would nonetheless be consistent with federal law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the foregoing is beside the point because the distinction between mandatory and permissive subjects of bargaining has nothing to do with section 7106(b)(3). That is, a proposed section 7106(b)(3) arrangement that falls outside the agency's duty to bargain does so precisely <span class="Italic">because</span> it is contrary to law, as the Authority appeared to acknowledge when it first adopted the "excessive interference" test. <span class="Italic">See Local 1923</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 186-88; <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 29-30. Thus, any time the agency's bargaining representatives could properly refuse to negotiate over a proposal because it does not qualify as a section 7106(b)(3) "appropriate arrangement[&#8197;]," that proposal will be contrary to law and rejectable by the agency head for precisely the same reason.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That this is so follows directly from section 7106's text and structure. Section 7106(a) establishes certain management rights, and provides that nothing in the FSLMRS will affect those rights. Section 7106(b)(3) sets forth an exception to section 7106(a)'s mandate, so that, if a proposal constitutes a section 7106(b)(3) "appropriate arrangement[&#8197;]," it does not violate section 7106(a) and is thus consistent with federal law. <span class="Italic">See AFGE I,</span> 702 F.2d at 1187. The agency then <span class="Italic">must</span> negotiate over such a proposal. <span class="Italic">See National Ass'n of Government Employees, Local R14-87</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. 313, 317-18 (1986). If, however, the arrangement is inappropriate, the section 7106(b)(3) exception is inapplicable, and, unless another exception applies, the proposal violates section 7106(a) and is thus both contrary to law and outside the agency's duty to bargain. As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union Local 21,</span> 36 F.L.R.A. 853 (1990), in rejecting the argument that an agency had waived its claim that a provision violated section 7106(a):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he proposal concerns the exercise of management's right under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, rather than under section 7106(b)(1). Therefore, the issues of "election" and "waiver" that would be involved if the proposal concerned a permissive matter under section 7106(b)(1) do not arise. A reserved management right under section 7106(a)(1) cannot be waived by collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 860. The same reasoning applies here. Unlike section 7106(b)(1), section 7106(b)(3) is all or nothing--it gives the agency no discretion to "elect" to address certain subjects during collective bargaining. Instead, it draws a line between what is and is not permissible under section 7106(a), and thus what is and is not consistent with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither in its decisions adopting the abrogation standard nor in its briefing before this court does the Authority address this basic point. In <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> after discussing at some length the fairly noncontroversial proposition that some subjects outside the duty to bargain might nonetheless be consistent with law, the Authority relied on its prior decision in <span class="Italic">EPA</span> for the key proposition that this distinction was somehow relevant to section 7106(b)(3) specifically. <span class="Italic">See NTEU I,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 512-13. The <span class="Italic">EPA</span> decision simply summarized the two examples of permissive subjects of bargaining discussed above, then stated: "No basis is provided to conclude that the situation is any different when management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are involved." <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. at 118. The "basis" for such a difference, however, is clear: unlike section 7106(b)(1), or the provisions governing conditions of supervisory employment, sections 7106(a) and 7106(b)(3) leave no room for agency representatives to reach agreements on terms outside the scope of the duty to bargain but within the range of lawful provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, for the first time the Authority addresses section 7106(b)(3)'s language, arguing that what is "appropriate" may "vary[&#8197;] depending on the circumstances." But the "circumstances" relevant to determining whether an arrangement is "appropriate" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) are those governing how, in a particular agency, the arrangement will affect the exercise of the management rights listed in section 7106(a), not how the issue comes before the Authority. The Authority's current interpretation of the statute could, as it concedes, mean that the propriety of two identical provisions, each affecting the exercise of management rights in precisely the same way, would rise or fall on the point at which the agency asserts the arrangement is inappropriate. Section 7106(b)(3) provides no basis for this sort of "magical[&#8197;]" transformation, as Member Beck put it. <span class="Italic">NTEU I,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 519 (Beck, M., dissenting). If it is a "normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning," <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Lundy</span>, 516 U.S. 235, 250 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), then a word that Congress uses only <span class="Italic">once</span> in a statute certainly cannot have more than one meaning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also argues that its differing substantive standards are justified by the differing degrees of deference owed to agency heads and agency bargaining representatives. It contends that its decision "rests significantly on the policy of deferring to the choices that parties make at the bargaining table," and that "applying the 'excessive-interference' test" with respect to agency-head review "would require agency heads to 'second guess' the bargaining parties' choices." <span class="Italic">See NTEU I</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. at 514; <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 F.L.R.A. at 118. In this context, however, we see little reason to prefer the bargaining representatives' assessment of a provision to that of the agency head. Although it may be true that the agency's bargaining representatives are better positioned to understand the meaning of a particular provision and why it was included in an agreement, <span class="Italic">see NTEU I,</span> 65 F.L.R.A. at 514, and while Congress may well have intended to preclude agency heads from second-guessing the legitimate concessions made during negotiations, <span class="Italic">see AFGE II</span>, 778 F.2d at 858 &#x0026; n.12, agency heads seem equally capable of assessing a given provision's consistency with section 7106, and section 7114(c) expressly commits such legal questions to the agency head. Indeed, the legislative history suggests that Congress enacted section 7114(c) in part due to the agency head's privileged high-level view of the agency's obligations, and that its concern over "second-guessing" was unrelated to legal questions of the sort involved in this review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In any event, whatever the validity of the Authority's policy rationale, it has failed to justify its atextual construction of section 7106(b)(3). As we have said: "The agency's policy preferences cannot trump the words of the statute." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Chertoff</span>, 452 F.3d 839, 865 (D.C. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, when an agency asserts that a contract provision falls outside section 7106(b)(3)'s exception to section 7106(a), whether the question concerns the agency's duty to bargain, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c), or the provision's consistency with law, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7114(c), 7122(a)(1), the underlying legal issue is precisely the same: does the provision represent an "appropriate arrangement[&#8197;]"? In applying two different standards in these contexts, the Authority has set forth two inconsistent interpretations of the very same statutory term, and thus acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we must therefore vacate the Authority's decision, and because the Authority has given no indication that it plans to abandon its "excessive interference" test, we have no need to address Treasury's alternative contention that the "abrogation" standard, even if applied in all cases, represents an impermissible construction of section 7106(b)(3)'s "appropriate arrangements" language. Nor need we decide, as Treasury urges, whether the particular sick leave provision at issue here was necessarily an inappropriate arrangement under the "excessive <span id="Page_421"></span>interference" test. Instead, consistent with our usual practice, we will permit the Authority to address those contentions in the first instance. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE I,</span> 702 F.2d at 1188. We therefore grant Treasury's petition, vacate the underlying decision, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand FLRA decided that the disputed provision survived the excessive interference test and directed the agency to rescind its disapproval of the proposal. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 67 FLRA 705 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting).</p>
