<p class="Body-Text">"To establish a charge of making false and malicious statements, an agency must show, by preponderant evidence, that the statements were incorrect, and that they were made with the intent of causing harm to agency employees." <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 98, 107 (1998). Slanderous statements about coworkers or supervisors erode the employment relations sufficiently to support removal of an employee with a record of poor performance and past discipline. <span class="Italic">Rogosky v. VA</span>, 24 MSPR 588, 591-93 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3159) (noting without analysis the dismissal of an employee who made false accusations against a supervisor of improper sexual behavior and racism, and who made false accusations to OSC and the Attorney General of corruption, incompetence, and racism by IRS officials, a congressman, and the Secretary of Treasury); <span class="Italic">Porter v. Mathews</span>, 428 F. Supp. 711 (N.D. Ala. 1976) (suspension of an employee who made unsupported allegations of misconduct against a superior); <span class="Italic">Houston v. United States</span>, 297 F.2d 838 (Ct. Cl. 1962) (discharge of a plaintiff following his unfounded charges of incompetence and malfeasance against superiors); <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 233-34 (1995) (misconduct charge against an OIG investigator: "The appellant's false accusations, which were reported not only to his former coworkers, but to Forest Service investigators, could have resulted in loss of employment and/or damage to the reputations of the individuals who were wrongly accused, and we find that this affects the appellant's reputation for honesty and integrity, as well as the agency's trust and confidence in his ability to perform his law enforcement duties."); <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250, 258 (1989) (removal for creating a disturbance in the workplace by rude remarks and impolite acts; intent, although going to the appropriate penalty, was not an essential element of the charge; mental disorders did not outweigh the egregious nature of the conduct); <span class="Italic">Muldrow v. Veterans Administration</span>, 22 MSPR 586 (1984) (sustaining removal: shouting and making sexually suggestive and threatening comments to supervisor was insubordinate: "there is nothing in the record to establish that appellant was subject to harassment or unfair treatment from his supervisor, or that he was goaded into a confrontation."); <span class="Italic">Hemelt v. Veterans Administration</span>, 21 MSPR 74 (1984) (mitigating removal to 60-day suspension of secretary for one incident of insulting, abusive, and obscene language to supervisor); <span class="Italic">Wheat v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 54, 57-58 (1984) (distinguishing the disciplinary offense of the improper use of obscenity and the legitimate expression of opinion concerning the truthfulness of another employee: appellant telling his supervisor that he was untruthful and that the appellant did not trust him was not insulting or insubordinate; the penalty was mitigated to a suspension because the charges were limited to one incident); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134, 94 S. Ct. 1633 (1974) (although the efficiency of the service standard excludes constitutionally protected speech, a reckless and wholly unfounded allegation that a supervisor tried to bribe another individual to cause harm to the appellant would not be constitutionally protected speech); <span class="Italic">Kohl v. USPS</span>, 115 Fed. Appx. 49, 52 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) ("The First Amendment does not require an agency to tolerate letters that disrupt a government workplace and intimidate other employees."); <span class="Italic">Hellstrom v. VA</span>, 46 Fed. Appx. 651, 656 (2d Cir. 2002 NP) (comments made during an agency investigation by an employee who was critical of affirmative action were personal and not protected under the First Amendment when they resulted in an adverse personnel action; the employee was not "starting a dialogue on affirmative action with supervisors or coworkers or seeking to change a policy at the VA"); <span class="Italic">Shaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike specification 3, which involved comments critical of an organization directed to an employee of that organization who was involved in the process about which the appellant voiced legitimate concerns, the comments described in specification 5 were critical of specific individuals and were directed to a subordinate agency employee with no apparent need to know the appellant's views regarding COL Sullivan's work ethic or LTC Boylan's competence. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wittenberg v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 12 M.S.P.R. 617, 620 (1981) (noting that the appellant's willful, disparaging, and demeaning attacks upon named supervisors with whom the appellant was in daily contact was of a more serious magnitude than articles written by employees which contained general allegations of incompetence and mismanagement by the agency). The Board has stated that disrespectful conduct is unacceptable and not conducive to a stable working atmosphere, and that agencies are entitled to expect employees to conduct themselves in conformance with accepted standards. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 303, 310 (1995). With regard to the accepted standards, the agency presented the testimony of COL Sullivan, who testified that it was acceptable for the appellant to voice his concerns regarding agency officials to COL Sullivan behind closed doors, but that it was inappropriate and detrimental to the organization and mission for the appellant to make his views known to the workforce "with people who have no business hearing those kinds of things." Furthermore, unlike the appellant in the <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> case on which the administrative judge relied [<span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Defense</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 160, 163 (1989)], the appellant in this case was a supervisor, and the agency was therefore entitled to hold the appellant to a higher standard of conduct than other employees. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Halper v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 170 &#x00B6; 11 (2002). Thus, contrary to the administrative judge's conclusions, we find that the comments the appellant made to Taka, which were disrespectful of both COL Sullivan, the appellant's superior and the commander of the organization to which Taka was assigned, and LTC Boylan, an Army officer assigned to higher headquarters with whom Taka had occasion to work, did warrant discipline and did constitute conduct unbecoming a Federal employee. <span class="Italic">See Guise</span>, 330 F.3d at 1380 (affirming the removal of a supervisory correctional officer charged with making disparaging remarks to subordinate employees regarding the associate warden). Accordingly, we find that the agency sustained this specification with respect to both comments. However, while we have not accepted the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency failed to sustain this specification, the agency's petition for review provides no basis to overturn the administrative judge's findings concerning the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct. For example, the agency has pointed to no evidence in the record which would show that the appellant's "lazy boss" comment was made maliciously or harmed COL Sullivan's reputation, and, while Taka's testimony may have described the general circumstances in which the appellant made the comment about LTC Boylan, the agency has not identified evidence in the record which detailed the specific context in which the appellant made this comment. Therefore, although we sustain this specification, we agree with the administrative judge's analysis to the extent that he found that the agency failed to establish that the underlying misconduct was egregious.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 54, 61-62 (1991), considered removal of the appellant, who slandered his supervisor through allegations of sexual misconduct. Dismissal was upheld; the statements were unprotected by the laws prohibiting reprisal against those who invoke EEO procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Inc.</span>, 545 F.2d 222, 233 (1st Cir. 1976), the court found that employees bringing discrimination complaints against their employers do not have "unlimited license to complain at any and all times and places." It thereby held that all conduct related to an employee's opposition to alleged discrimination was not immune from discipline, and concluded that the plaintiff's conduct, which it found to be hostile, disruptive, and disloyal, was not protected. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Relying upon <span class="Italic">Hochstadt</span>, the Board in <span class="Italic">Oliver v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 34 MSPR 465, 474-75 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 847 F.2d 842 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table), held that disclosures which are false or malicious are not protected even though they are made during an employee's involvement in (what would otherwise be) protected activity. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Oliver</span>, the appellant's false and malicious statements cannot be considered to be disclosures that are protected under the umbrella of 5 USC 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency's deciding official recognized that, although the appellant first broached the subject of his alleged sexual harassment with his unit's EEO counselor, he later inappropriately discussed those allegations with other agency officials who he knew were not involved in the agency's EEO complaint process. The deciding official went on to find that the nature of the appellant's statements made them "[u]nacceptable under any circumstances." We agree with the deciding official, and find that the content of the appellant's statements and the manner in which they were made them "unacceptable," and precluded them from being accorded the status of a protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under other circumstances, it would have been unnecessary for the appellant to have actually filed a formal sexual-harassment complaint against Chief Klein in order for such activity to be considered "protected" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See Special</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 291 (1988) (an employee's announced intention to file a complaint as expressed to his supervisor is sufficient to give his disclosures protected status). Here, however, the appellant never made any sort of announcement to Chief Klein about his alleged intention to file a sexual harassment charge, and only belatedly informed <span class="Italic">any</span> appropriate agency official of his expressed intentions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, it is uncontroverted that the appellant, when discussing with his unit's EEO counselor the subject of bringing a complaint against Chief Klein, was told then that the time had passed for filing an EEO complaint and that he should immediately take the matter up with Ms. Booth or Ms. Parham, the responsible agency EEO officials. It is further uncontroverted that the appellant disregarded the counselor's advice and did not even attempt to file a sexual harassment complaint with the appropriate agency official until after his removal had been proposed. Prior to making that (unsuccessful) attempt, however, the appellant had already communicated to two of his supervisors the same explicit and uncorroborated allegations of sexual activity by Chief Klein that he had previously related to the EEO counselor. In addition, the EEO counselor testified that the appellant had not raised the allegations to him in his official capacity, but, rather, that he had related the accusations in a "joking" manner, as would one friend to another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's actions serve to reveal his barely-concealed hostility and vindictiveness towards Chief Klein, and do not reflect the actions of an individual who is legitimately pursuing a claim of sexual discrimination. Thus, we conclude that the appellant's statements were not "protected" disclosures, and that he has failed to establish that his removal for making those statements constituted reprisal in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See Oliver,</span> 34 MSPR at 474-75.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2743"></span><span class="Italic">Quarry v. GAO</span>, 3 MSPR 200, 206-08, 3 MSPB 299 (1980), sustained dismissal of a supervisory auditor whose letters to the President, to a member of Congress, and to the Justice Department consisted of allegations that there existed a massive conspiracy to harass the appellant and to do him mental and physical harm. The allegations were directed at those with whom the appellant had contact at work, at GAO, and on Capitol Hill. The Board conducted a <span class="Italic">Pickering</span> analysis and weighed the balance in favor of the employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]s the evidence concerning appellant's judgment came to the attention of the agency by means of letters which he had written to government officials about his superiors and coworkers (which were then returned to the agency by the recipients), care must be taken to assure that appellant is not deprived of any protections which the First Amendment may provide in his situation. Accordingly, we have examined the case before us in light of the balancing test required by <span class="Italic">Pickering...</span>in cases involving adverse actions taken against public employees because of their speech. The Supreme Court held that the First Amendment requires a balancing test between the interests of the employee and the public in the speech, and the interests of the government, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the service it performs through its employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 391 U.S. at 566-567, 88 S. Ct. at 1733-1734. Several factors were listed by the Court as weighing in the government's favor, but were not applicable in that case. They were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">whether the statements were directed towards any person with whom appellant would normally be in contact in the course of his daily work; whether there is a question of maintaining discipline or harmony among coworkers; whether the working relationship between the employee and those who are criticized are such that personal loyalty and confidence are necessary to their proper functioning; whether the speech interfered with the regular operation of the office generally; and whether the speech impeded the employee's proper performance of his daily duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 569-572, 88 S. Ct. at 1735-1737.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An examination of appellant's position indicates to us that the factors just listed weigh in favor of the government's interest in promoting the efficiency of the service in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, as a GAO supervisory auditor, was required to work independently and to have frequent contact with Congressional staffs in order to compile his reports. Two of appellant's supervisors testified that they lost confidence in his work and judgment as a result of the letters and one further testified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I did have discussion with Mr. John Walsh of the Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs....&#8197;He was quite concerned that we would have someone on our staff who would make these kinds of...unsupported...allegations against officials on the Hill, against coworkers of the General Accounting Office, against staff members of House Committees...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that an important element of appellant's position was the ability to maintain good working relationships with Congressional staff members. We agree with the agency that such a professional relationship would be impossible to maintain if appellant were to be writing irrational, extreme accusations to and about various persons on the Hill, among others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that GAO's interest in promoting the efficiency of the service by maintaining professional and confidential working relationships with Congressional staffs in order to prepare its GAO Reports outweighs appellant's right to make extreme allegations to government officials about nearly everyone with whom he comes into contact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant asserted that he should have been reassigned to another position rather than removed, citing <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton,</span> 566 F.2d 265 (D.C. Cir., 1977). That case held, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> that an agency must exercise informed discretion in determining whether reassignment or leave without pay are reasonable alternatives to removal of an employee suffering from a mental condition. The court added that the informed exercise of discretion necessarily contemplates a comprehensive and detailed report of a psychiatric examination so as to adequately inform the agency as to the scope of the medical problem. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 282. The record shows that such a psychiatric evaluation of appellant's mental condition has been impossible for the agency to obtain. Again, we are convinced that the agency did not wish to punish appellant. Rather, this agency made every reasonable effort to help him, with removal being the last available resort.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Balance there must be. A polar distance can exist between words spontaneously uttered in momentary pique, irritation, or pettiness, and a careful long-range plan to harass another by unfounded accusations of serious derelictions. <span class="Italic">Burkett v. United States</span>, 402 F.2d 1002, 1006, 1008 (Ct. Cl. 1968) (setting aside removal for charges of false statements against a supervisor: "Embarrassment--discomfiture, distress, abashment--can be, and often is, slight, minor, and temporary, with little or no lasting effects. It can be, and often is, a mere petty annoyance of short duration."). False statements against a supervisor resulting in removal were considered in <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 76 (1986). The Board mitigated the penalty to a 30-day suspension. The employee had 11 years of service; the incidents occurred during an isolated two-week period; the appellant may have been affected by her medication or reaction to mental stress; and the appellant performed satisfactorily in a detail for seven months between the date of the proposal and the date of the removal. Her record showed a high probability of rehabilitation. The Board declined to find mental disability discrimination. In a subsequent decision, the Board awarded counsel fees. <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 240, 243 (1987). An isolated, though damaging and scurrilous, untruthful statement about a coworker netted mitigation from removal to a 90-day suspension in <span class="Italic">Credit v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 370, 372-73 (1987) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Rogosky v. VA</span>, 24 MSPR 588, 592-93 (1984), and relying on <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 30 MSPR 72, 76 (1986)). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dolezal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 64, 71-72 (1993) (discipline was based, in part, on inappropriate remarks about a subordinate passed through personal email messages).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before critical or allegedly false comments will sustain discipline, the Board considers the motives and background of the speaker. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOD</span>, 41 MSPR 160, 162-63 (1989), without articulating extensive constitutional analysis or broad guidelines, reversed the initial decision that a dismissal should be sustained based on statements in letters written to a manager, as well as on innuendo attributed to the letters. The decision should be read in full to savor the Board's treatment of each alleged misstatement and innuendo:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the first specification, the agency charged that the appellant made unfounded, misleading, and malicious statements by implying in two letters that Lt. Colonel Hall had lied to Colonel Boyle. In the letters in question, the appellant stated that it appeared that Colonel Boyle had been given some false information, that it appeared that Colonel Boyle had been given some bad information, that the agency's previous actions of suspending him for seven days, barring him from the motor pool, reassigning him to the warehouse, and having his character defamed, were all a vicious plot, that Lt. Colonel Hall should be restricted from viciously threatening to terminate him and other employees, and that the vicious acts of Lt. Colonel Hall had been brought to the agency's attention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first two statements, the appellant qualified his assertions by saying that "it appeared that" the information was "bad" or "false." We find that the appellant was thus merely trying to indicate that he did not believe that Colonel Boyle was acting upon correct information. While the appellant's attempt to make this point could perhaps have been done more tactfully, we will not hold an employee occupying the position of Motor Vehicle Operator to such a sophisticated standard. Thus, the appellant's statements, that it appeared to him that Colonel Boyle had received some "false" or "bad" information, were not unfounded, misleading, or malicious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the circumstances leading up to the appellant's comments both establish that the appellant reasonably believed that his job was threatened and therefore tend to excuse his use of the word "vicious." On January 5, 1987, the agency suspended the appellant for five days. The appellant was also informed, at that time, that further misconduct would result in progressively severe penalties, including removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 14, 1987, the appellant wrote to his congressman about his suspension, and expressed his concern that the agency was threatening to take further action against him. On March 9, 1987, the appellant met with Lt. Colonel Hall regarding his disciplinary record. Although Colonel Hall's written statement indicates that he did not intend to threaten the appellant with termination, it conceded that the appellant interpreted the conversation as a threat to terminate him. Shortly thereafter, Colonel Boyle responded to a congressional inquiry about the appellant's complaint. When the appellant saw Colonel Boyle's response to the inquiry, he wrote the letters concerning the statements at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant reasonably believed that his job was in jeopardy, and his use of the word "vicious" was simply excusable hyperbole. We, therefore, conclude that the agency has failed to prove that the statements in the first specification were unfounded, misleading, and malicious.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again considering motivation or intent, <span class="Italic">Mooney v. DOD</span>, 44 MSPR 524, 527 (1990), found the Board reversing discipline of an appellant charged with making false statements concerning agency and contractor employees. The appellant allegedly said that he was being followed, someone was trying to poison him, and someone was breaking into his car. The statements were not actionable because the employee thought they were true:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the agency assails the initial decision on the grounds that the record demonstrates that the appellant's statements were all false in that none of the assertions made actually occurred, and that it met its state of mind evidentiary burden by contending that no "reasonable man" would have believed any of the charged statements were true.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, however, that the agency failed to meet its burden of proof <span id="Page_2744"></span>because the "reasonable man" standard is not a probative substitute for motive evidence, particularly here, where the appellant's competence has not been challenged. Thus, there is no evidence that at the time each of the statements were made, the appellant knew or believed they were false. Rather, he specifically denied that the statements were false. Nor is there any record evidence from which such an inference could be drawn. The appellant followed up his statements with efforts to seek assistance in discovering the persons responsible for the actions against him....&#8197;Finally, there is no apparent motivation for the appellant to profit financially to the government's detriment as a result of any of the charged statements....&#8197;In sum, there is no basis for concluding that the appellant knowingly made false statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the agency failed to prove the requisite intent, the charge of making false statements cannot be sustained....</p>
