<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-8"><span class="space">1.</span> Service Requirements</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">For CSRS, 5 USC 8333 provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee must complete at least 5 years of civilian service before he is eligible for an annuity under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee or Member must complete, within the last 2 years before any separation from service, except a separation because of death or disability, at least 1 year of creditable civilian service during which he is subject to this subchapter before he or his survivors are eligible for annuity under this subchapter based on the separation. If an employee or Member, except an employee or Member separated from the service because of death or disability, fails to meet the service requirement of the preceding sentence, the amounts deducted from his pay during the service for which no eligibility for annuity is established based on the separation shall be returned to him on the separation. Failure to meet this service requirement does not deprive the individual or his survivors of annuity rights which attached on a previous separation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For FERS, 5 USC 8410 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eligibility for annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an employee or Member must complete at least 5 years of civilian service creditable under section 8411 in order to be eligible for an annuity under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8337, five years of creditable civilian service are required for CSRS disability retirement. For FERS, the creditable civilian service required for disability retirement is 18 months. 5 USC 8451. [Refer later in this chapter to "Disability Retirement."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions from the Board and the Federal Circuit involving service credit stem principally from CSRS claims. Summarized, the requirements for basic annuity entitlement under the Civil Service Retirement Act are: (1) that an employee complete at least five years of creditable service before he is eligible for a deferred annuity, (2) and that the employee must complete, within the last two years before any separation from service, at least one year of creditable civilian service, while subject to the retirement system, before he is eligible for an annuity based upon the separation. However, a failure to meet the coverage service requirement does not deprive the individual or his survivors of annuity rights that attached on a previous separation. <span class="Italic">Caseria v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 285, 286-87 (1992); Credit cannot be provided on equitable grounds. <span class="Italic">Sabado v. OPM</span>, 905 F.2d 387, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("The Board has no authority under any law, rule, or regulation to waive substantive CSRS entitlement requirements and award an annuity on the essentially equitable grounds advanced by the appellant.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The CSRS requirements need be met but once during the employee's federal career, <span class="Italic">Wallen v. OPM</span>, DC-0841-15-0167-I-1 (NP 9/2/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eligibility for retirement benefits under CSRS generally requires that the employee demonstrate that he has completed: (1) at least 5 years of civilian service; and (2) at least 1 year of creditable civilian service covered by CSRS within the last 2 years prior to "any separation from service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Carreon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 321 F.3d 1128, 1130 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The administrative judge found that the appellant met the first requirement because he completed more <span id="Page_4081"></span>than 13 years of creditable service during his continuous employment from August 1977 through December 1990. He also determined that the appellant met the second requirement because he completed at least 1 year of creditable civilian service in a position covered by CSRS within the last 2 years before his separation from service in December 1990. Thus, although the appellant did not meet the eligibility requirements as to his most recent separation in 2011, the administrative judge found that he did meet the eligibility requirements and was eligible for a retirement annuity based on his separation occurring in 1990.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties do not challenge these findings on review, and we discern no basis to disturb them. Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that, contrary to the finding in OPM's reconsideration decision, the appellant meets the eligibility criteria for a deferred retirement annuity under CSRS based on his separation from service in 1990.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For CSRS, the appellant must have worked in a position or positions subject to CSRS, and not all positions qualify, <span class="Italic">Alo v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 571, 575 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201 set forth a list of categories of employees excluded from retirement coverage. Under OPM's regulations, the appellant's service in contract appointments for one year or less, and service in temporary intermittent appointments, is not subject to retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.201(a)(12), (a)(13); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a) ("An employee must complete at least 5 years of civilian service before he is eligible for an annuity"); <span class="Italic">see also, Ecdao v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 28 MSPR 7, 9 (1984); <span class="Italic">Castro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 MSPR 326, 327 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the evidence submitted by OPM and the appellant's failure to file evidence to meet his burden of proof, the denial of the appellant's application for retirement benefits by OPM was proper. <span class="Italic">See Baldos v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 28 MSPR 12, 14 (1984) (an employee who does not present evidence to show that his service was covered is not entitled to a civil service retirement annuity); <span class="Italic">see also Hollowell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 30 MSPR 465, 468 (1986) (an employee must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to civil service retirement for the years in question).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that because he served the Federal government for over 20 years "with distinction and dedication," he should thus be eligible for an annuity is incorrect. Because the appellant's civilian service consisted of excepted, nonpermanent appointments, which were excluded from coverage under the Act, the appellant was not entitled to a retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is not eligible for an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333 unless he or she has completed five years of civilian service, including at least one year of covered service during his last two years of employment. The record reflects no evidence that the appellant served in a position covered by the CSRS. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Untalan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 30 MSPR 297, 299-300 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For CSRS retirement, there must be five years of service credit and the appellant must complete at least one year of service subject to coverage under the civil service retirement system within the two years preceding his final separation. At issue in <span class="Italic">Hollowell v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 465, 466-69 (1986), was whether the latter condition was met by service in temporary appointments, leading to a determination that the employee did not have the required covered service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of his request for a civil service retirement annuity, appellant presented evidence showing that he had over five years of civilian service. OPM conceded before the Board's Philadelphia Regional Office that appellant had more than five years of creditable civilian service. OPM maintained, however, that appellant is ineligible for a retirement annuity because he did not complete at least one year of service subject to coverage under the civil service retirement system within the two years preceding his final separation on July 16, 1976.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333, provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(a)&#x2003;An employee must complete at least 5 years of civilian service before he is eligible for an annuity under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">An employee or Member must complete, within the last 2 years before any separation from service, except a separation because of death or disability, at least 1 year of creditable civilian service during which he is subject to this subchapter before he or his survivors are eligible for an annuity under this subchapter based on the separation</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows, in relevant part, that appellant received a temporary appointment not covered by the civil service retirement system, effective May 20, 1975. That appointment was terminated on June 29, 1975. He received a second noncovered temporary appointment effective July 1, 1975. Effective July 20, 1975, appellant received a career-conditional appointment reinstatement subject to coverage under the civil service retirement system. Appellant resigned on July 16, 1976.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM maintained that appellant's service under the two temporary limited appointments was excluded from civil service retirement coverage under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1),[5] and could not be used to satisfy the one-out-of-two years of covered service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b). After affording the parties a hearing, the presiding official found in an initial decision that appellant's reinstatement to competitive status on July 20, 1975, rendered his service under the prior temporary appointments creditable for civil service retirement purposes under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1201(b)(2),[6] as an exception to &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1). The presiding official concluded that appellant's service under his prior temporary appointments became covered service under the civil service retirement system since the exclusion from coverage of such service under &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1) did not apply by virtue of &#x00A7; 831.201(b)(2). Therefore, the presiding official found that appellant met the one-out-of-two years of covered service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1) provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia:</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden is on the appellant to establish by preponderant evidence his entitlement to civil service retirement credit for the years in question. <span class="Italic">See Huskey v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 363, 365 (1985). Appellant's service under the two temporary appointments in 1975 was as a temporary employee, excluded from the competitive service under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.3 and &#x00A7; 212.401(a), and, therefore, from civil service retirement coverage under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gacayan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 333 (1981); <span class="Italic">Castro v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 326 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record is undisputed that appellant was granted competitive status by his career-conditional appointment reinstatement effective July 20, 1975, and that he resigned on July 16, 1976. Thus, appellant had competitive status in a position covered by the Civil Service retirement system for three days short of one year out of the last two years immediately preceding his final separation from service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under OPM's administrative interpretation of the &#x00A7; 8333(b) one-out-of-two years of covered service requirement, retirement coverage is afforded only to an employee who is serving in a position covered by the civil service retirement system. FPM Supp. Ch. 831-1, subch. S-2-5(a) (September 21, 1981), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;If an employee is not accorded retirement coverage upon appointment, but later is granted competitive civil service status in a competitive position, or the status is restored by action of reinstatement, <span class="Italic">retirement coverage attaches as of the date he or she acquires or reacquires competitive status. The action is prospective only</span> and retirement deductions can be made beginning on the day the employee acquires coverage under the retirement system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis supplied.) Thus, under OPM's interpretation, retirement coverage does not attach retroactively to permit prior noncompetitive civil service status to satisfy the one-out-of-two years of coverage service requirement of &#x00A7; 8333(b). As the agency charged with the administration of the statute, OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 8333(b) is entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Moore v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 560, 565 (1981). Moreover, OPM's interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the plain language of &#x00A7; 8333(b) that an employee <span class="Italic">must</span> complete, within the last two years before any separation from service, except for death or disability, at least one year of covered civilian service before he is eligible for a retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 420, 422 (1985). <span class="Italic">Cf. In re Kaltakji,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 61, 62 (1970) (the fact that contract service is creditable for retirement purposes does not in the absence of one year or more of covered service give an employee entitlement to a civil service retirement annuity). The eligibility requirement of &#x00A7; 8333(b) is clearly a substantive legal requirement for retirement eligibility, and it allows for no administrative discretion on the part of OPM and equitable estoppel does not obtain. <span class="Italic">See Graef v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 23 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1984); <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 267 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold, therefore, that the presiding official erred by including appellant's service under his prior temporary appointments towards <span id="Page_4082"></span>satisfying the requirement of &#x00A7; 8333(b) of completion of at least one year of covered civilian service within the last two years immediately preceding final separation. Since appellant's covered civilian service was three days short of one year out of the last two years immediately preceding his final separation from service, he is not eligible for a civil service retirement annuity under &#x00A7; 8333(b). <span class="Italic">Cf. Graef, supra,</span> (the employee's civilian service totaling four years, eleven months and twenty-four days was short of the five-year eligibility requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a), and OPM was not estopped from enforcing the requirement even assuming the employee had resigned only after receiving assurance from his personnel office that he had completed five years of civilian service). Thus, appellant has not carried his burden of showing entitlement to a civil service retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Huskey, supra.</span></p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to an annuity, an employee must complete five years of civilian service and at least one of the last two years of that service must be "covered" service, i.e., service that is subject to the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333; <span class="Italic">Rosete v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 48 F.3d 514, 516 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Most government service is "creditable service," but "service that is creditable service is not necessarily covered service." <span class="Italic">Herrera v. United States</span>, 849 F.2d 1416, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Covered service is more limited in scope and refers to appointments that are "subject to the CSRA and for which an employee must deposit part of his or her pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund." <span class="Italic">Rosete</span>, 48 F.3d at 516.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first consider whether Mr. Yandoc's initial period of employment was covered service. The personnel forms relevant to Mr. Yandoc's first period of employment do not indicate whether Mr. Yandoc's employment was subject to the CSRA. The forms likewise do not indicate that Mr. Yandoc paid contributions into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. Both of these indications would normally appear if Mr. Yandoc's first period of employment had been covered. Importantly, Mr. Yandoc was ultimately covered under another retirement system in accordance with the U.S. Forces Philippines's CBA. Given these facts, the AJ did not err in finding that Mr. Yandoc's first period of employment did not entitle him to CSRS retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See Quiocson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 490 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory requirement relative to necessary service applies to applicants for disability retirement and optional retirement, <span class="Italic">Mangaliag v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 227, 229-31 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant had also applied for a disability retirement annuity, and that such benefits do not require any covered service. He based this finding on the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee...must complete, within the last 2 years before any separation from service, <span class="Italic">except a separation for death or disability</span>, at least 1 year of creditable civilian service during which he is subject to this subchapter before he...[is] eligible for an annuity under this subchapter based on the separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis supplied). He found this exception consistent with the lack of a reference to the covered service requirement in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8 337(a), which provides that "[a]n employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application...." The administrative judge acknowledged that OPM's regulation provides that a disability retirement claimant must become disabled while employed in a covered position, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1203(a)(2), but found that this regulation is inconsistent with the plain language of the section 8333(b) exception. Because the evidence indicated that the appellant had in excess of five years creditable civilian service, and that he was separated due to disability, the administrative judge concluded that the appellant met the service requirement for a disability retirement annuity. He further found that the case must be remanded to OPM to determine whether the appellant is otherwise eligible for the disability benefit he seeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that the Board has jurisdiction to review only issues adjudicated by a final decision of OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110; <span class="Italic">Bowers v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 200, 203 (1989). It would therefore be inappropriate for the administrative judge or the Board to address the merits of the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits if OPM's reconsideration decision had not adjudicated this issue. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> OPM's initial decision on the appellant's application stated that, "In order to be eligible for a civil service annuity (<span class="Italic">disability or non-di</span>sability), you must have been employed by the U.S. Government for at least five years, ending in a period that was subject to Retirement coverage." (Emphasis added.) Although OPM's reconsideration decision did not specifically refer to requirements for disability retirement, it reiterated that the "separation on which annuity title may be based must be from a covered position, and must be preceded by 5 years of creditable service." We find that OPM thus adjudicated the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits in its final decision, and that it is therefore appropriate for us to address this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8337(a) of title 5, U.S. Code, provides in pertinent part that an "<span class="Italic">employee</span> who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application...." (Emphasis added.) As OPM points out in its petition for review, the term "employee," as used in section 8337(a), specifically excludes "an employee or group of employees in or under an Executive agency excluded by the Office of Personnel Management under section 8347(g) of this title...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(1)(iii). Accordingly, only individuals separated from a covered position can qualify for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's contention that the exception contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) relates only to the length of the covered service requirement is confirmed by an examination of the Civil Service Retirement Act as it existed prior to the enactment of the one-out-of-two year requirement in 1954, the elimination of this requirement to disability retirements in 1956, and the legislative history of these two amendments to the Retirement Act. As OPM points out in its petition for review, all of the substantive entitlement provisions of the pre-1954 Act, including those relating to disability retirement, were prefaced with phrases such as "any employee to whom this Act applies," i.e., employees in covered positions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., Civil Service Retirement Act of 1930, ch. 349, &#x00A7; 6, 46 Stat. 468, 472.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The enactment of the one-out-of-two-year requirement in 1954 was designed to close the loophole that allowed an employee who had five or more years of Federal service, but who had never been subject to the CSRS, to be appointed to a covered position for a few weeks, and then be retired with an annuity toward which he had made no material contribution. <span class="Italic">Hawco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 290, 293 (1992). Disability retirement claimants were subject to the one-out-of-two-year requirement from 1954 until 1956, when Congress added the exception that now exists in section 8333(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Executive Pay Act of 1956, ch. 804, &#x00A7; 401, 70 Stat. 736, 746; S. Rep. No. 2642, 84th Cong., 2d Sess., <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1956 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3725, 3730. Nothing in the legislative history of the 1954 or 1956 amendments to the Retirement Act indicates any intent to eliminate the covered service requirement entirely for those retiring on disability.</p>
