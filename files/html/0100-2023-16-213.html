<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-213"><span class="space">f.</span> Grievances</h5>
<p class="noindent">The union is entitled to be represented at a grievance meeting: a formal discussion scheduled in advance, structured in accordance with negotiated grievance procedures, and concerning a grievance filed under the negotiated grievance procedure by a unit employee. <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 98, 98-99 (1984). Under &#x00A7; 7121(b)(3)(B), the union has the right to be present and represented during formal discussions of a grievance, including any grievance presented by an employee on his or her own behalf. <span class="Italic">Office of Program Operations, Field Operations, SSA, San Francisco Region and AFGE Council of Social Sec. Dist. Office Locals, San Francisco Region</span>, 10 FLRA 172, 177 (1982). An agency violates &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) by holding a formal discussion with a unit employee concerning her grievance without notifying her representative of the meeting and providing the union an opportunity to be present. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 14 FLRA 499, 532 (1984) (ALJ Decision). A contract may modify the statutory notice and representation requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent">The term "grievance" is to be broadly interpreted. The statutory definition is broadly phrased, 5 USC 7103(a)(9):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(9)&#x2003;"grievance" means any complaint--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;by any labor organization concerning any matter relating to the employment of any employee; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;by any employee, labor organization, or agency concerning--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;the effect or interpretation, or a claim of breach, of a collective bargaining agreement; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">[Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-233.html#sec6-234">Last Chance Agreement</a>," and earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-186.html#sec8-186">Representation During Investigations; <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> Rights</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA emphasized the broad nature of a grievance when it determined that the term covered an employee's call to security police about an incident in the workplace, leading to a formal discussion, with the right of the union to be on notice of and present at a meeting the day after the call, when the employee was presented with memoranda involving her placement on administrative leave and a schedule change, <span class="Italic">DOD, Tyndall AFB and AFGE Local 1113</span>, 66 FLRA 256, 259-60 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have a right to be represented under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Boston Reg'l Office, Boston, Mass.</span>, 59 FLRA 875, 878 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting as to application). The Judge found, and there is no dispute, that the first three requirements are satisfied here. Thus, the only issue is whether the Judge erred by finding that the memoranda meeting did not concern a grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute entitles the exclusive representative to be represented at certain "formal discussion[s]...concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment[.]" The Authority has emphasized that the intent behind &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) is to afford an exclusive representative the opportunity to be present at discussions addressing matters of interest to unit employees in order to take "appropriate action" to safeguard their interests. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def., Nat'l Guard Bureau, Tex. Adjutant General's Dep't, 149th TAC Fighter Group (ANG) (TAC), Kelly Air Force Base</span>, 15 FLRA 529, 532 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Kelly AFB</span>). The Authority has long held that the term grievance under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) should be interpreted in light of its broad definition in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1185-89 (D.C. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether a discussion "concern[s]" a grievance, neither the Statute nor Authority precedent defines the term "concern." Thus, in assessing whether the memoranda meeting concerned a grievance, it is appropriate to consider the ordinary usage of the definition. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., ACT, Razorback, Chapter 117, </span>56 FLRA 427, 430 (2000) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring). A common dictionary meaning of the word "concern" is "to relate or refer to." <span class="Italic">Webster's Third New International Dictionary</span> 471 (2002). Consistent with this broad definition, the Authority has found that a meeting concerned a grievance even where it did not directly involve a grievant, such as where it was held to interview witnesses scheduled to testify in a grievance arbitration hearing. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2054, </span>63 FLRA 169, 172 (2009). Further, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) requires management to give the employees' exclusive representative notice of, and an opportunity to be present at, a meeting even if the meeting was called for the purpose of making a statement or announcement rather than to engender dialogue. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan Air Force Base, Cal., </span>29 FLRA 594, 598 (1987) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Judge found that the purpose of the memoranda meeting was to discuss the contents of two memoranda, one of which stated that it was placing the employee on administrative leave. Undisputed record testimony, which the Judge did not discredit, stated that the employee's supervisor "nodded in the affirmative" when the employee asked whether she was being placed on administrative leave because of her call to the security police. Further, as stated previously, the Judge determined that the call to the security police constituted a grievance within the meaning of the Statute, and there are no exceptions to this finding. As this finding is undisputed, we assume, without deciding, that the Judge's conclusion in this regard is correct. Thus, the meeting was called, at least in part, to inform the employee that she was being placed on administrative leave, and this action was taken based on the grievance. Therefore, the meeting "related to"--i.e., "concerned"--the grievance. As such, we find that the memoranda meeting constituted a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kelly AFB</span>, 15 FLRA at 533. Further, as the Respondent failed to give the Union notice of and an opportunity to attend the meeting, we find that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116 (a)(1) and (8).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union makes clear its intent to initiate a grievance over a specific matter involving an employee, the union is bypassed, or improperly denied notice and the opportunity to attend the meeting, if management undertakes formally to resolve the subject matter of the grievance with the employee. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, New York Office of Asylum, Rosechale and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 55 FLRA 1032, 1035-39 (1999), discussed the concept of a grievance and the elements of a formal discussion:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The October 16 Meeting Concerned a "Grievance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute defines the term "grievance" broadly to include "any complaint...by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee[.]" <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). In determining whether a formal discussion concerns a grievance under section 7114(a)(2)(A), invoking a union's right to be represented, the Authority has stated, citing precedent of long-standing duration, that the term "grievance" "'should be interpreted in light of its broad definition in section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute.'" <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>, 51 FLRA at 1344 (quoting <span class="Italic">FCI, Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 590).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has had many occasions to apply that broad definition in addressing whether a formal discussion concerned a grievance.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>, the Authority held that the term "grievance" encompasses the informal stages of a grievance procedure. 51 FLRA at 1344. In addition to contractual grievances, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">FCI, Ray Brook</span>, for example, <span id="page_1475"></span>that the term "grievance" in section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal. In the particular circumstances of that case, the Authority found that an oral reply to a notice of proposed suspension was not a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). The Authority also held, in <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 54 FLRA 716, 730 (1998), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. Luke Air Force Base, Arizona v. FLRA</span>, No. 98-71173 (9th Cir. Oct. 9, 1998), that "[t]he statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure." <span class="Italic">See also National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181, 1186 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>) ("Nothing in this definition [of section 7103(a)(9)] restricts a 'grievance' to matters raised through a negotiated procedure.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Judge found that the employee had not filed a grievance, citing Article 47 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. According to the Judge, the negotiated grievance procedure does not provide that, where an employee is "thinking about filing a grievance," the Union "can insist upon a meeting with the supervisor to decide if it should file a grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge's conclusion that no grievance was filed under Article 47, and our dissenting colleague's adoption of that conclusion, fail to take into account fully the terms of the negotiated grievance procedure. Article 47 has both informal and formal steps. The first step is informal and involves an oral communication between the "concerned-employee" and the employee's supervisor. The first step also provides that an employee "may...be assisted in the presentation by the Union representative." The second step is formal and reduces the grievance to written form.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes, and it is undisputed, that the Union filed a formal written grievance, that is a Step II grievance, on September 28. The Judge examined the formal grievance and found that it "highlighted" the employee. We concur with that finding. Among other things, the formal grievance specifically referred to the employee as "the grievant" and explained that the Union official had attempted to initiate a grievance on behalf of the employee under the first step of the grievance procedure, noting that "investigations relative to grievances at Step I level are conducted in person and informally." The grievance also expressly states that the employee requested representation and that the day after being contacted by the employee, the steward requested a meeting with the first-line supervisor. The grievance also requested that the employee "be afforded every opportunity...to meet with the Union representative in order for her to address her complaints[,]" and specified actions that the Respondent should take to allow the Union to meet with the employee and management "to discuss and possibly settle issues concerning [the employee]." Although the formal grievance also described the employee as having merely "contemplat[ed] a grievance" before the Union requested to talk with the first-level supervisor, and described the request to meet as pertaining to a "possible grievance," we focus here on the totality of the record evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also establishes that the formal grievance placed the Respondent on notice that, at a minimum, the Union wanted, and had attempted, to discuss the employee's concerns with the employee's first level supervisor and that it viewed the scheduled discussion as a Step I grievance. In this connection, the grievance letter shows that it was filed with the Respondent's Director, the same official who subsequently notified the employee of the meeting, and that it was filed more than 2 weeks before the employee was notified of the October 16 meeting.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;If the Respondent was confused about the basis of the Step II grievance, the Respondent could have sought clarification from the Union. Although we acknowledge that the Union declined to provide requested clarification concerning the reason for the September 22 meeting with the first-line supervisor, there is no reason to believe that the Union would have replied similarly to a request for clarification of the basis for the Step II grievance, since information concerning the grievance had been revealed through the filing of the formal grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Other evidence that the Judge credited also establishes both that the Respondent was aware of the employee's difficulties with her supervisor, and that the Respondent intended to and did discuss those very matters at the October 16 meeting. In particular, the Judge credited the Director's testimony as to that meeting as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I directed that meeting following a counseling session that I had with [the employee] with her issues with her supervisor. She thought that her supervisor was not competent to give her direction, and she was refusing to take direction from her. She didn't like the way her supervisor communicated with her. I then talked to her supervisor about it and found that their communication had broken down entirely. In recognizing that her supervisor...was inexperienced in supervision, the first time she had ever supervised anyone, I asked a more experienced supervisor to meet with the two of them to try to help them work out their differences.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge further characterized the meeting as one designed to address the problems that the employee and the supervisor were having with one another, in terms of training and following instructions, as well as the supervisor's competence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the Respondent was on sufficient notice of the Union's failed attempt to file an informal grievance on behalf of the employee and that it was aware that the October 16 meeting concerned the same topic as the informal grievance. In light of the identity of issues presented in the failed attempt at filing the informal grievance and the October 16 meeting, we find that the meeting concerned a "grievance" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute at which the Union should have been given an opportunity to be represented<span class="Italic">. See FCI, Ray Brook</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A conclusion that the October 16 meeting did not concern a grievance and that the Respondent "would have had no idea that the employee's personal concerns were intended to be subsumed in the [formal] grievance," can be reached only by analyzing each fact in isolation from all other facts and engaging in a strained reading of the grievance. Not only is this approach inconsistent with the Authority's long-standing practice of examining the totality of the circumstances presented, but it is at odds with a proper interpretation of the Statute, as set forth above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining that the October 16 meeting constituted a formal discussion, we also find that the employee's statement, relied on by the Judge and noted by our dissenting colleague, that the grievant had not discussed the possibility of filing a grievance with the Union, does not warrant a different conclusion. While we do not ignore the Judge's credibility findings about the grievant, we do not find the grievant's testimony on this dispositive. Resolving whether the employee filed a "grievance" involves both statutory and contract interpretation. The employee, applying a lay person's definition of a "grievance"--for example, as a piece of paper filed with the employer--would not necessarily know that requesting an opportunity to orally raise concerns about her employment would commence a grievance. It is also understandable that, as a probationary employee, the employee would not be aware of all the rights provided by the Statute and the parties' agreement. Where, as here, the record contains no information as to the employee's understanding of the Statute and the contract terms, we conclude that it would be inappropriate to give dispositive weight to her response when questioned whether she discussed a "grievance" with the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as the Authority recognized in <span class="Italic">FCI, Ray Brook,</span> section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute essentially has a dual intent and purpose: "to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit...." 29 FLRA at 589. Particularly in situations where the union is providing direct assistance to an employee who believes he or she has been wronged, section 7114(a)(2)(A) must not be construed as an impediment to the employee's ability to grieve a condition of employment. Stated otherwise, section 7114(a)(2)(A) must not be applied in a way that restricts an employee's access to its protections by impairing a union's ability to safeguard the interests of the employee. However, that is precisely what the dissenting opinion does in this case by unnecessarily restricting the statutory definition of grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, in finding that the October 16 meeting concerned a grievance, we emphasize that our conclusion is based on the record evidence presented in this case. Not <span class="Italic">every</span> meeting at which an employee's concerns are discussed is transformed into a formal discussion concerning a grievance. For example, it is well established that "counseling sessions" do not constitute formal discussions<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 156. Where, as in this case however, the record establishes that the "concerns" related to work assignments and job performance, had previously been the subject of a counseling session, existed throughout much of the employee's tenure and ultimately culminated in the employee's removal, and the Respondent was on notice that the Union had attempted to file an informal grievance on the employee's behalf, the concerns were more than simply efforts to discuss differences of opinion the employee had with the supervisor or air the employee's "gripes." We believe that the statutory definition of grievance, along with the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) provide sufficient guidance for determining when a meeting between an employee and a representative of an agency becomes a formal discussion for purposes of invoking a union's right to representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the October 16 meeting concerned a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The October 16 Meeting Was "Formal"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent disputes the Judge's finding that the October 16 meeting was formal essentially for two reasons: 1) the meeting lacked an agenda; and 2) the "purpose and nature" of the meeting was informal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More particularly, the Respondent states that "having a meeting, and having a purpose to be achieved by that meeting, does not equate to having an agenda." The Respondent asserts that the Authority should <span id="page_1476"></span>reach the same result in this case as it did in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps, Barstow</span>). Additionally, the Respondent maintains that "highly personal counseling sessions" are informal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 155-57, the Authority discussed the element of "formality" in section 7114(a)(2)(A). The Authority noted that, in some cases, formality is established based on the purpose of a discussion. In other cases, formality is assessed through an examination of several factors set forth in Authority precedent. Whichever approach is used, the Authority reaffirmed that the totality of the facts and circumstances presented in each case must be considered in determining formality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, a preponderance of the evidence in the record supports the Judge's finding that the October 16 meeting was formal. The meeting was scheduled in advance, was conducted by a supervisory asylum officer, took place in that official's office, and was mandatory. Although no notes or minutes of the meeting were taken, the supervisory asylum officer reported the results of the meeting to the Respondent's Director. The decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Barstow</span>, on which the Respondent relies, provides no support for holding that the October 16 meeting was not a formal discussion. In that case, the Authority found, based on the totality of the circumstances presented, that a meeting with employees was not formal. The Authority pointed to a number of factors in support of its conclusion, including the fact that the meeting was held on the shop floor and lasted only 10 minutes, only the first-line supervisor attended the meeting, no agenda was prepared and no notes were taken. Since the formality of each discussion is assessed on a case-by-case basis, the Authority is not compelled to reach the same result in both cases particularly where, as here, there were other factors present to support the Judge's finding of formality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we disagree with the Respondent's assertion that the October 16 meeting was an informal counseling session. For the reasons stated in the preceding section, the meeting concerned an employee grievance, at which the Union should have been provided with an opportunity to be represented.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Respondent Violated Section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge did not decide whether the Respondent bypassed the Union in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute. Under Authority precedent, an agency violates section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when, among other things, it deals directly with employees in a unit of exclusive recognition concerning a grievance. As the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Agencies unlawfully bypass an exclusive representative when they communicate directly with bargaining unit employees concerning grievances, disciplinary actions[,] and other matters relating to the collective bargaining relationship. Such conduct constitutes direct dealing with an employee and is violative of...the Statute because it interferes with the union's rights under section 7114(a)(1) of the Statute to act for and represent all employees in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">51 FLRA at 1346.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our findings above, that the October 16 meeting concerned a grievance and was formal, the Union had a right under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to be present. Because the Respondent failed to notify the Union of the meeting and afford it an opportunity to be represented, and instead met directly with an employee concerning a grievance, we conclude that the Respondent bypassed the Union in violation of section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A meeting was formal that concerned a grievance, was initiated by telephone between a fourth-level supervisor and an employee, and was held at the supervisor's office. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 249, 250 (1985). A formal meeting involved discussion and resolution of a grievance; the grievant was called to the office by management, one of whom was not just a first-level supervisor, and the meeting was neither impromptu nor casual. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 63rd Civil Eng'r Squadron, Norton AFB and AFGE Local 3854</span>, 22 FLRA 843, 845 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals and AFGE Council 215</span>, 25 FLRA 571, 575 (1987) ((when there is no meeting concerning grievance, and management processes grievance presented by an employee on his or her own behalf through correspondence, only way for union to be "present during the grievance proceeding" is for union to receive notice that grievance was filed and, on request, receive documents relating to grievance as it progresses through negotiated grievance procedure). A union was bypassed when its collective bargaining agreement requested the parties to attempt to resolve grievances informally, before a written or formal grievance was filed; a meeting was called with the employee and his second and third-level supervisors to discuss the differences over criticisms of the employee's performance that were leading to a grievance; at the meeting the employee's request for union representation was refused; and the union was not notified of the meeting. The violation occurred, even though no discussion occurred at the meeting concerning differences over the employee's performance. For purposes of statutory analysis, "discussion" is synonymous with "meeting." No actual discussion or dialogue was required for the meeting to constitute a discussion within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Bastrop and AFGE Local 3828</span>, 51 FLRA 1339, 1343-45 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent">There are occasional exceptions to the general rule. A meeting to resolve a grievance between an employee and his first-level supervisor, where the supervisor is to present to the employee a reevaluation of his performance, was not formal. No other supervisor was present, the meeting lasted only 10 minutes, it was called informally and was not scheduled in advance, there was no formal agenda, and the supervisor's comments were not noted or transcribed. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 17 FLRA 948, 951 (1985).
