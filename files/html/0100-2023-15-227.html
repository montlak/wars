<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-226"><span class="space">1.</span> Proof of Fraud; Falsification</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">To establish a charge of falsification, an agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant intentionally provided incorrect information. The charge of a false statement will be considered relatively narrowly; if the agency charges the employee with a particular false statement, it cannot then seek to revise the charges before the Board to include charges of broader errors. The agency must establish that the appellant supplied the incorrect information with the intent to deceive (or defraud) the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tackett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 624, 629 &#x00B6; 13 (1999) ("A charge of 'lying,' or falsification...requires proof that the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency."); <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 365, 374 (1994) ("To sustain a falsification charge, the agency must prove by preponderant evidence that the employee knowingly supplied incorrect information with the intention of defrauding the agency."); <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233, 238 (1989) (test is whether an employee knowingly supplied wrong information with the intent of defrauding or deceiving the agency). Charges of falsification and misrepresentation require the same elements of proof. <span class="Italic">Guerrero v. VA</span>, 105 MSPR 617, 622, 2007 MSPB 132 &#x00B6; 9 (2007). Under <span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 100, 106-07 &#x00B6; 10, 2014 MSPB 86 (2014), charges of misrepresentation, falsification, and lying require the same elements of proof; the intent to defraud or mislead the agency may be established by circumstantial evidence or inferred when the misrepresentation is made with a reckless disregard for the truth or with conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. That an appellant provided incorrect information cannot alone establish the intent required for a falsification charge. But an incorrect statement, coupled with the lack of any credible explanation or contrary action by the appellant, can constitute circumstantial evidence of an intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">Suarez v. DHUD</span>, 96 MSPR 213, 227 &#x00B6; 40 (2004) (examining the nature of appellant's part in a real estate transaction involving agency property); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. DHS</span>, DA-0752-12-0601-I-1 (NP 5/23/2014) ("Likewise, the absence of a credible explanation for the misrepresentation can constitute circumstantial evidence of intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7 (1998). In sum, the Board examines the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the agency has proven such intent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Delancy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 129, &#x00B6; 4 (2001)."). If it turns out that the employee's statements during an investigation are true, the agency cannot expect the false statements charge to be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 86, 95 (1991). The agency cannot simply allege false statements; it must prove their falsity. If the agency's proof is confused and does not establish either that a statement is false or that a falsification referenced in an investigation report relates to the form allegedly falsified, the agency cannot prevail on the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Seigla v. Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 62 MSPR 55, 58-59 (1994). The Board examines the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the agency proves intent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A falsification charge cannot be sustained without findings of fact concerning the appellant's intent. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 318, 321 (1987) (remanding for the issuance of proper findings). However, "[w]hat is designed in the mind of an individual is never susceptible of proof by direct evidence. Intent must be inferred from conduct, actions, sayings, results, and all the facts and surrounding circumstances." <span class="Italic">Kotichas v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1983 NP No. 83-867), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> <span class="Italic">Kotichas v. VA</span>, 14 MSPR 193, 196 (1982).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency submitted evidence to show that the appellant provided incorrect information. With regard to specification 1 of the charge, the agency submitted evidence to show that the appellant had falsified his educational information. Specifically it introduced evidence that the appellant would have been classified as a freshman at Bemidji State University and did not possess a master's degree from that institution. The appellant failed to rebut this showing either with evidence that he did, in fact, have a master's degree from Bemidji State University or with evidence to explain why he misrepresented that he did. In assessing the totality of the circumstances, the administrative judge properly determined that the appellant falsified his educational background with intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">See Nelson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the second specification, the agency provided the testimony of Dorene Krenn, an employee of the Health Partners Riverside Clinic, regarding the memorandum that the appellant supplied stating that a nurse at the clinic had seen him on October 20-21, 2005. Krenn testified that the memorandum is inconsistent with the clinic's documentation procedures for a number of reasons, including that the medical record number on the memorandum looks like a social security number and the clinic does not use social security numbers to identify patients. The appellant could have rebutted this testimony either with evidence showing that the memorandum was a true and accurate medical record or with evidence explaining why he mistakenly thought that it was. He failed to do so. Based on the totality of the evidence, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant falsified this medical record with the intent to deceive. <span class="Italic">See Nelson</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7.</p>

The appellant failed to provide any plausible explanation or justification for his request for military leave in October 2005. Accordingly, the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellant knowingly supplied false information to substantiate his military leave request with the intent to deceive or mislead.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the foregoing, we find that the agency has failed to establish that the appellant knowingly supplied the disputed information on his Optional Form 612 with the intent to mislead it. Rather, when the appellant's entire application package is considered as a whole, it appears that he completed his Optional Form 612 in haste and failed to carefully review each request for information in the context of the category in which it appeared. Although the appellant's actions can be characterized as careless, we cannot conclude on the record before us that he intentionally falsified his application when he indicated that he had held a GS-12 position during the period in which he was enlisted. We, therefore, find that this specification cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's policy (Code 2.2), referenced in the charge, states that "an employee is prohibited from knowingly providing false or misleading information...or signing or attesting to the truthfulness of the information...in reckless disregard of the accuracy or completeness of the pertinent information contained therein." However, in resolving the issue of how a charge should be construed and what elements the agency must prove, the Board examines the structure and language of the proposal notice and the decision notice as well as the accompanying circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Boltz v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's notice of proposed action used the word "fraud" to describe the appellant's T&#x0026;A records. Additionally, the decision notice states that the deciding official concluded that "the record as a whole demonstrates [that the appellant] provided false T&#x0026;A information on a regular basis." On this basis, we hold that the agency charged the appellant with falsification and was therefore required to prove that charge by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)] ; <span class="Italic">Boltz,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 568, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">George,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 596, &#x00B6; 7.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has repeatedly held that a statement against one's interest, such as an admission of wrongdoing, is generally regarded as highly reliable. <span class="Italic">Ludlum v. Department of Justice,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 18 (2000); <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 278 F.3d 1280 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Beck v. Department of Justice,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 219, 223, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 70 F.3d 129 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The appellant admitted that he "signed the time registers. Sometimes [he] signed them blank. [He] didn't necessarily review each day or each time period. [He] understand[s] that's [his] responsibility, but at the time [he] did not know." He could not estimate how frequently this occurred. The appellant admitted that, "yeah, absolutely" it is likely that the time cards are inaccurate with respect to the time recorded for a given day. The appellant also asserted that he worked "the average" of what was shown on his time records, which was yet another admission that his records for individual days were not correct. These admissions of wrongdoing established one of the elements of falsification--the making of a false statement. <span class="Italic">See Leatherbury</span>, 524 F.3d at 1300. Moreover, these were statements against the appellant's interest and therefore may be considered reliable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the agency admits in its proposal notice that many agents in the same office engaged in similar record-keeping practices, that the team leader would decide when work was done for the day, and that with respect to January 26, 2008, the appellant followed the explicit instructions of his team leader regarding how to record his time. We therefore find credible the appellant's assertions that he was following common office practices and his team leader's instructions regarding time keeping records. Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, the agency has not shown by preponderant evidence that the appellant had the intent to defraud, deceive, or mislead. <span class="Italic">See Crump</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 6. Accordingly, the charge of falsification has not been proven by preponderant evidence and is not sustained, and the initial decision holding that the agency's action must be reversed is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Member Rose dissented based on her conclusion that falsification was established by the appellant's reckless disregard for the truth:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I agree with the majority that the administrative judge erred when he failed to recognize that, in a falsification charge, intent can be shown by evidence that the appellant made a misrepresentation with a reckless disregard for the truth or with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth. I do not agree that the facts here fail to support a finding of reckless disregard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Quite simply, the appellant was submitting blank time sheets, trusted others to complete them for him, and did not go back to check whether they were accurate. In my view, this is a textbook case of reckless disregard for the truth. The fact that others may have engaged in the same or similar conduct with the knowledge of agency supervisors means that reckless behavior was widespread in the appellant's office. It does not, as the majority finds, mean that what the appellant did was not reckless. I would find that the agency proved that the appellant acted with reckless disregard for the truth and I would sustain the charge. Consistent with existing precedent, I would consider the fact that this was common practice and the possibility that management condoned the appellant's behavior as a mitigating factor in the penalty analysis. <span class="Italic">See Wells v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 637, 645 (1992) (supervisors' condonation of the appellant's disregard of timekeeping regulations was a significant mitigating factor); <span class="Italic">cf. Howard v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (although the appellant contended that the charge should be reversed outright on the grounds of agency condonation, the Board considers condonation as a mitigating factor in the penalty analysis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the underlying information is not false, the agency may still charge intentional deception or intentionally providing misleading information, <span class="Italic">Trujillo v. DHS,</span> DA-0752-10-0436-I-2 (NP 6/29/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency proved the alleged misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellant asserts that in <span class="Italic">Valenzuela v. Department of the Army</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 549 (2007), the Board held that, even if a statement is intended to mislead or deceive, a charge of providing misleading or false information cannot be sustained if the statement itself is not also false. The appellant contends that there was nothing false or incorrect about the manner in which the barbeque pit was described on the CBP form because a barbeque pit is a heating element, he intended to use the heating element for the incineration of documents, and it was in fact used for that purpose. The appellant further contends that he did not deceive anyone by identifying the item as a heating element/document incinerator instead of a barbeque pit because the purchase of a barbeque pit would have been authorized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board in <span class="Italic">Valenzuela</span> did not hold that, even if an appellant intended to mislead or deceive, a charge of providing misleading or false information cannot be sustained if the statement itself is not also false. Rather, in holding that the falsification charge could not be sustained in that case, the Board specifically relied on the finding that the agency <span class="Italic">failed</span> to prove that the appellant intended to deceive or mislead the agency when he provided the information at issue in that case and not on the truth or falsity of the underlying statement. <span class="Italic">Valenzuela</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 549, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 192, 199 (1996), summarized the necessity for showing intent when the appellant is charged with defrauding the government:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A false claims charge is similar in nature to a charge of falsification. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Skinner v. Department of the Army,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 586, 587 (1987) (falsification of time cards, including claims for overtime).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's intent may be inferred from evidence of his reckless disregard for the truth or for ascertaining the truth, the falsity of his statements alone is not enough to sustain a charge of falsification or fraud. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mooney v. Department of Defense,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 524, 526-27 (1990).

Moreover, to prove intent when the appellant has been charged with falsification or fraud for material gain, the agency must show that his misrepresentation or reckless disregard for the truth pertained to facts material to the amount he was paid.

See Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 314 &#x00B6; 6 (1998). Here, the appellant argues that the arbitrator erred in upholding the charge in the absence of proof of an intent to deceive. This argument is not persuasive, as the arbitrator found that the appellant's claim that he did not intend to deceive anyone was not credible. Moreover, the arbitrator's remark, in his discussion of the appropriate penalty, that the appellant's misconduct was rooted in his performance difficulties rather than in an any venal or corrupt purpose, is not the equivalent of finding that the appellant had no intention of deceiving or misleading the agency. Rather, the point of much of the arbitrator's discussion is that the appellant's actions were designed to deceive or mislead the agency into thinking that his performance was timely and adequate, when it actually was not. While the arbitrator acknowledged that the appellant might have acted out of his inability to perform his work rather than out of corruption, he nevertheless found that the appellant did falsify government records. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Reed v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the agency failed to establish the requisite intent because the record evidence does not show that the appellant knew or should have known that his policy was improper. <span class="Italic">See Kane v.

Scott</span>, 69 MSPR at 227 (the appellant's failure to provide a plausible explanation for the discrepancies constitutes, at best, a reckless disregard for the truth or for ascertaining the truth about the statements he made, and establishes that he therefore had the requisite intent to deceive). We therefore conclude that the agency failed to establish that the appellant <span id="Page_2750"></span>instituted the policy with the intent to deceive the agency and thereby failed to prove this charge....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. DOJ</span>, 35 F.3d 1543, 1546-48 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that circumstantial evidence may not be sufficient to support the necessary finding of intent in an employment application falsification case if direct evidence negates intent:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[T]o sustain a charge of '[s]ubmitting false information on official government documents,' the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee knowingly supplied wrong information, and that [s]he did so with the intention of defrauding the agency." <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 782 F.2d 975, 977 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency originally maintained that Jacobs had lied about a number of things. The Board, however, sustained the Agency in only one allegation: that Jacobs had falsified a government document by maintaining, on Question 22 of the "Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions," that she had not left a job under unfavorable circumstances. The Agency maintained, and the Board agreed, that this statement was untrue in regard to her departure from Stitches. On the basis of the one allegation, however, the Board upheld the Agency conclusion that Jacobs was untrustworthy, and that her untrustworthiness warranted her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, on the record before us, the Agency decision to remove is in fact a chain of propositions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;In Question 22, Jacobs said she never left a job under unfavorable circumstances;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Jacobs left her job at Stitches "under unfavorable circumstances," <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, at the behest of management;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Therefore Jacobs knowingly gave a wrong answer on a government document;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;Therefore Jacobs lied to the government ("falsified a government document");</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;Therefore Jacobs is untrustworthy, and should have been removed from the sensitive position she occupied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Jacobs's untrustworthiness has been established solely by deduction, the Agency needs to establish the truth of each of the propositions from which her untrustworthiness is deduced. A chain is only as strong as its weakest link: the Agency must establish before the Board each proposition with at least the preponderance of the evidence required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c). In our review of the Agency decision, we must be shown substantial evidence for the Board's determination that the Agency had preponderant evidence for each proposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jacobs does not contest that: she was late to, or absent from, work at Stitches several times; she was asked to go home after coming to Stitches late one day; she did not work following this episode. From this the Board concluded that Jacobs "left her job under unfavorable circumstances" in the sense intended by Question 22. Read in context, however, Question 22 asked whether the unfavorable circumstances caused the departure from the job, that is, asked whether or not Jacobs left at the behest of management. The Agency thus needs to show a causal relationship between Jacobs's admitted delinquency and her departure. The Agency shows only that (i) Jacobs was late, and shortly thereafter, (ii) Jacobs left her job. One must deduce the theory required for Respondent's case from the sequence of events, <span class="Italic">viz</span>. that Jacobs's absence and tardiness caused her to be fired. For her part, Jacobs says that she could have gone back to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge noted that the manager of Stitches at the time of the initial decision, Carol Dunlap, submitted two affidavits, dated January 6, 1992, and February 19, 1992, stating that Jacobs was <span class="Italic">not</span> fired. The Agency did not challenge Dunlap's statements before the Administrative Judge; nor has the Agency challenged Dunlap's statements in its brief to this court. We take it, then, that the Agency does not contest the veracity of Dunlap's statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency's conclusion as to the cause of Jacobs's termination is supported by an alignment of circumstances suggestive enough to constitute substantial evidence, if only barely. But under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c), the Agency must support its case for the removal of an employee by a <span class="Italic">preponderance</span> of the evidence. There are two massive flaws in the Agency's case at this stage. First, the Agency never explicitly stated that it had to prove causality, and made no attempt to show causality. Though not impossible, it is difficult to prove a necessary and nonobvious element of a case without even stating it. Second, even if we were to accept that the sequence of events suggests that Jacobs was fired, this suggestion is countered by the direct testimony of both Jacobs and the manager of Stitches, Carol Dunlap. As a matter of evidence, a plausible but by no means necessary deduction from a sequence of events cannot outweigh two direct denials with sufficient force to constitute preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, Board decisions are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(c), and will not be overturned if supported by "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 647 F.2d at 1096.... The conclusion reached by the Board was that the Agency proved its case by a preponderance of the evidence. Given that the Agency failed to state its case properly, that is, failed to allege the issue of causation, and given that there was at least comparable and perhaps weightier evidence against the Agency position, which the Board made no effort to evaluate, the Board's decision is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From steps (1)-(3) the Agency, and then the Board, concluded step (4), that Jacobs must have lied. Nothing compels this conclusion. "The substantiality [and hence the preponderance] of evidence must take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight." <span class="Italic">Universal Camera,</span> 340 U.S. at 488, 71 S. Ct. at 464. There is no consideration of the possibility that Jacobs might be telling the truth. There is no consideration of the possibility that reasonable minds might differ on how to evaluate the circumstances under which Jacobs left Stitches. The Agency, in its judgment, might have answered Question 22 differently. But certainly the Agency does not maintain that the answer to Question 22 is patent, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that any reasonable person in Jacobs's circumstances would acknowledge her departure from Stitches as "unfavorable." The Agency provides no evidence to dispute Jacob's claim that she might have kept her job. A difference of opinion--and the Agency's assessment of Jacobs' departure from Stitches makes no greater claim to truth than opinion--does not necessarily entail falsification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to accept that Jacobs answered the question incorrectly, that conclusion would not require the conclusion that Jacobs intended to lie. "The fact of an inaccurate response cannot control the question of intent. Were a bare inaccuracy controlling on the question of intent, the 'intent' element of the charge would be subsumed within the distinct inquiry of whether the employee's answer adheres to the true state of facts." <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, 782 F.2d at 978. The Agency is not entitled simply to deduce step (4) of its argument from its prior demonstrations, such as they are.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Agency is not entitled to reach step (4) by deduction, it might have tried to reach the proposition by induction, that is, the Agency might have supported its position with evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 978 (agency decision may be upheld on circumstantial evidence). But the Agency has produced no evidence whatsoever to support step (4). On the other hand, there is some evidence, admittedly circumstantial, that Jacobs is not a liar: she has over a decade of government service without complaint; she has character witnesses; she has her own word. While perhaps not much, this is more evidence than the Agency introduced, and the statute requires that the Agency prove its case by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c). But, as at step (2), the Agency gives no sign that it is even aware it must prove that Jacobs lied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its opinion, quoted above, the Board recognized that the Agency needed to prove a lie. But the Board does not and could not supply the evidence that the Agency neglected to provide. Regarding Question 22, the sole basis of its holding, the Board found, without any support whatsoever, "that the appellant should have answered 'Yes' to question 22 and should have indicated that she left Stitches under unfavorable circumstances..." In the absence of evidence, the Board asserted a motive for lying: "I find that the appellant wished to conceal from the agency what caused her to leave her job at Stitches." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board begs the question. This is not preponderance of the evidence. This is not even substantial evidence. There is literally no evidence here; the statement is purely conclusory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An omission meets the test of intent if it is the product of the appellant's interest in including on his employment application the experience he believed to be most relevant and excluding other employment history. <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 55 MSPR 504, 510 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 412 &#x00B6; 33 (1999) ("[h]er conscious omission of that information from the report supports an inference of falsification, even if other legitimate reasons for the alien transfers in question existed," citing <span class="Italic">Hanker v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 73 MSPR 159, 164 (1997), for the proposition that "omission of information may constitute falsification in the absence of any plausible explanation for the failure to include the information."). Because a false statement is made with intent, if the statement is the product of mental disorder, it does not constitute an offense properly characterized as a false statement. If the result of the statement is disruption in the workplace, however, the ensuing disruption may separately furnish a basis for discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 40 MSPR 250, 255-56 (1989) (false statements concerning the conduct of coworkers); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gillis v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 642, 646 (1984) (analyzing a "reliance on counsel" defense to the falsification of an employment application inquiry concerning a criminal record). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-233.html#sec8-232">Employment Application; Security Questionnaire; Lack of Candor.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intent may be demonstrated by violation of a policy clearly communicated to <span id="Page_2751"></span>the employee in the course of a prior disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Ahles v. DOJ, INS</span>, 768 F.2d 327 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Wise v. United States</span>, 603 F.2d 182 (Ct. Cl. 1979)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McIntire v. FEMA</span>, 55 MSPR 578, 586 (1992) (intent would be established when the employee had reason to know that his actions contravened agency policy but intent was not established when the evidence failed to show that the employee knew or should have known the actions were improper). One circumstance demonstrating intent to defraud can be the extent to which the employee knew the correct method of charging his work to agency daily time sheets. <span class="Italic">Khalsa v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1540).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Intent may be discerned by a failure to correct a known error, <span class="Italic">Arnett v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 84-1738):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...The presiding official carefully evaluated the testimony and concluded that Arnett's misrepresentation was intentional, particularly given its specificity on the form, the fact that Arnett did not initially disclose to his supervisor that he had already visited a private doctor, and Arnett's failure to swear out a second, correct statement until his supervisor confronted him with the true facts.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The fraud can be committed by another, but the appellant may be charged with knowledge of or gain by the fraudulent act. In <span class="Italic">Pittelli v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 329, 331-32 (1992), the appellant, a manager for the Postal Service, was charged with knowing of and benefiting from the failure of her husband, a postal employee, to report to OWCP information about his self-employment that, had it been known by the Department of Labor, arguably would have diminished his income. The appellant knew of her husband's outside employment, but there was no direct, indirect, or circumstantial proof that she knew that he had failed to report his outside earnings. That the spouse was working and still receiving OWCP benefits, indirectly assisting the appellant, did not demonstrate her knowledge that he failed to report those earnings. The agency failed to produce evidence detailing OWCP procedures for reducing or eliminating the benefits of individuals who are employed, and no evidence demonstrated special provisions, e.g., an amount that may be earned without affecting an individual's benefit entitlements or a delay in reducing or eliminating benefits subsequent to restoration of earning capacity.</p>
