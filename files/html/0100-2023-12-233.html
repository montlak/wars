<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-232"><span class="space">1.</span> Governing Statute and Regulation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies cannot take Board decisions into court to obtain judicial review. Only OPM has that authority, should the government seek to contest a Board ruling. Before OPM may seek judicial review, 5 USC 7703(d) requires that the Office seek the Board's reconsideration pursuant to a statutory procedure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except as provided under paragraph (2), this paragraph shall apply to any review obtained by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management. The Director may obtain review of any final order or decision of the Board by filing, within 60 days after the Board issues notice of the final order or decision of the Board, a petition for judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit if the Director determines, in the discretion of the Director, that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. If the Director did not intervene in a matter before the Board, the Director may not petition for review of a Board decision under this section unless the Director first petitions the Board for a reconsideration of its decision, and such petition is denied. In addition to the named respondent, the Board and all other parties to the proceedings before the Board shall have the right to appear in the proceeding before the Court of Appeals. The granting of the petition for judicial review shall be at the discretion of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reconsideration process is controlled by 5 CFR 1201.119 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria</span>. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7703(d), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may file a petition for reconsideration of a Board final decision if he or she determines:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;That the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;That the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time limit</span>. The Director must file the petition for reconsideration within 35 days after the date of service of the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Briefs</span>. After the petition is filed, the Board will make the official record relating to the petition for reconsideration available to the Director for review. The Director's brief in support of the petition for reconsideration must be filed within 20 days after the Board makes the record available for review. Any party's opposition to the petition for reconsideration must be filed within 25 days from the date of service of the Director's brief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Stays</span>. If the Director of OPM files a petition for reconsideration, he or she also may ask the Board to stay its final decision. An application for a stay, with a supporting memorandum, must be filed at the same time as the petition for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">York v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 505, 506-10 (1983), <span class="Italic">following remand for clarification of reconsideration standards</span>, <span class="Italic">York v. MSPB</span>, 711 F.2d 401 (D.C. Cir. 1983), provided the Board's earliest, most extensive discussion of the purpose and scope of the OPM reconsideration process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is on remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which has directed the Board to articulate the standard determining the circumstances under which the Board entertains petitions for reconsideration filed by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[1] Such petitions are authorized by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d). In this case the Board reconsidered and reversed its previous decision in response to a petition under that section, in which OPM contended that the Board had misapplied its holding in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313 (1981), concerning when the penalty imposed by the agency under Chapter 75 meets the statutory standard, "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," and the extent of the Board's authority to mitigate the penalty selected by the agency. 10 MSPB 218 reconsideration of and reversing 6 MSPB 381. The Board's reconsideration decision addressed the merits of its previous decision without discussing the standards which govern its reconsideration of final decisions under section 7703(d) or otherwise.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 7703(d), the Director of OPM is authorized to seek judicial review of a Board decision:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director's right to file such a petition in a case where he has not participated in the Board proceeding is conditioned, however, on his first petitioning the Board for reconsideration of its decision. The legislative history indicates that this requirement was imposed "to avoid unnecessary appeals by the Director" by ensuring that "the Board has an opportunity to consider the concerns of OPM before suit is brought." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 64 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, pp. 2723, 2786.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a vehicle permitting OPM to bring its views on the proper interpretation of civil service law to the attention of the Board, the reconsideration procedure serves the same function as the Director's right to participate in appeals to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701. Section 7701(d) entitles the Director to intervene in the initial consideration of an appeal,[4] and section 7701(e) provides that the initial decision in an appeal will not become final if the Director petitions the Board for review within 30 days after receipt of the decision.[5] The same standard governs the Director's exercise of his discretion to intervene or petition for review under section 7701 or to seek reconsideration or judicial review under section 7703: his determination that an erroneous interpretation of a law or regulation under the jurisdiction of OPM will have a substantial impact on its administration.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 7701(d) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;In any case in which--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;the interpretation or application of any civil service law, rule, or regulation, under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management is at issue in any proceeding under this section; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;the Director of the Office of Personnel Management is of the opinion that an erroneous decision would have a substantial impact on any civil service law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office; the Director may as a matter of right intervene or otherwise participate in that proceeding before the Board. If the Director exercises his right to participate in a proceeding before the Board, he shall do so as early in the proceeding as practicable. Nothing in this title shall be construed to permit the Office to interfere with the independent decisionmaking of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The Board shall promptly notify the Director whenever the interpretation of any civil service law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office is at issue in any proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Section 7701(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in section 7702 of this title, any decision under subsection (b) of this section shall be final unless--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;a party to the appeal or the Director petitions the <span id="Page_1806"></span>Board for review within 30 days after the receipt of the decision; or</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;The Director may petition the Board for a review under paragraph (1) of this subsection only if the Director is of the opinion that the decision is erroneous and will have a substantial impact on any civil service law, rule, or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The wording of the standard varies slightly. Section 7701(d) addresses intervention prior to any decision where an erroneous decision with substantial impact is only potential, while sections 7701(e) and 7703(d) involve intervention to challenge an allegedly erroneous decision with such impact. It is clear from the legislative history that other variations in phrasing do not reflect any intended substantive differences. S. Rep. No. 95-969, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 53, 55, 64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate Report emphasizes that OPM should seek Board or judicial review only in cases of exceptional importance and not where the potential effects of the decision will be limited to the facts of the particular case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 53, 55, 64. There is no indication, however, that Congress intended the Board to review the Director's "substantial impact" determination. This silence is in noticeable contrast to the references to the court's authority to do so. Section 7703(d) states that the granting of the Director's petition for judicial review "shall be at the discretion of the Court of Appeals," and the Senate Report explains that the court may decline to accept the petition "[i]f it determines, for example, that the issues raised will not have a substantial impact on the administration of civil service laws...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 64, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2786.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(d) refers to the Director's "right to participate" and states that he "may intervene as a matter of right" in any Board proceeding when he is "of the opinion" that an erroneous interpretation of the laws under his jurisdiction would have a substantial impact. This language is inconsistent with the view that the Director must convince the Board that its decision will have substantial impact before he is entitled to consideration of his position. The Director's right under section 7701 to participate in Board proceedings and the reconsideration procedure under section 7703(d) are both designed to ensure the Director an opportunity to present his views to the Board concerning the proper interpretation of the laws for which OPM is responsible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we conclude that when OPM does not participate in an appeal under section 7701, the Director is entitled to the Board's consideration of his contention that it has misinterpreted a provision under OPM's jurisdiction.[7] Such an error in interpreting a civil service law will necessarily have some impact outside the case in question because of the decision's precedential effect.[8] How substantial an effect the alleged error is likely to have on the future administration of the provision in question is a matter for the Director's determination which we do not believe the Board is intended to review before granting the petition for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;OPM's right to be heard under section 7703(d) does not apply when OPM's objections are not based on an alleged erroneous interpretation of the laws for which OPM is responsible. <span class="Italic">E.g., Portlock v. Veterans Administration,</span> 16 MSPR 92 (1983). Reconsideration on other grounds is discretionary with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The Director is not entitled to reconsideration of a decision without any precedential value because its effect is necessarily limited to the particular case<span class="Italic">. Seibel v. Air Force,</span> 18 MSPR 5 1 2 (1983); <span class="Italic">Grant v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 18 MSPR 510 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to reconsider its decisions is not, however, coextensive with the obligation to consider OPM's views which we have articulated here in response to the Court's direction in its remand order. Like other administrative agencies, the Board has inherent authority to reconsider its decisions on its own initiative "as long as proper notice is given and the right is exercised within a reasonable time." <span class="Italic">Bookman v. United States,</span> 453 F.2d 1263, 1265, 197 Ct. Cl. 108 (1972). <span class="Italic">See Dawson v. MSPB,</span> 712 F.2d 264, 267-268 (7th Cir. 1983). In its reconsideration decision in this case, the Board concluded that it had improperly considered as mitigating factors allegations as to motive which the presiding official found not to be credible. It also concluded that its previous decision had mistakenly relied on appellant's alleged ignorance of procedures which did not excuse the misconduct of an employee in his position and with his years of experience. We need not decide whether the Board in so ruling implicitly found that its previous decision misinterpreted the rules applicable to determination of the proper penalty under Chapter 75, since the Board had authority in any case under the circumstances here to reconsider and reverse its previous decision. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dunning v. NASA,</span> 718 F.2d 1170 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (it was immaterial whether the petition for review of an initial decision did not meet the standards of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115, since the Board in any case had authority to reopen and reconsider on its own motion under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM must seek MSPB reconsideration to obtain judicial review even when OPM was an original party before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 405, 408 (1996) (relying on <span class="Italic">King v. Ferrier</span>, 22 F.3d 1106 (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP), and <span class="Italic">King v. Moir</span>, 33 F.3d 65 (Fed.

OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 67, 71-72 (1999) (same as <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>; declining to impose the law of the case doctrine against OPM director on a reconsideration petition). An earlier decision, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Williams</span>, 29 MSPR 1, 2 (1985), denied an OPM reconsideration petition when OPM had already actively participated in the appeal and "had ample opportunity to make its concerns known to the Board." OPM may raise through reconsideration issues not earlier raised by OPM in the appellate process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eller v. OPM</span>, 121 MSPR 551, 555 &#x00B6; 7, 2014 MSPB 72 (2014) ("The Board will consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the arguments raised by OPM on petition for reconsideration, even in cases where OPM was a party to the proceedings before the Board. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 9 (2012).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Ferrier</span>, 22 F.3d 1106, 1994 WL 112797 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (NP), relied on in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, involved a petition for judicial review by OPM's Director of a Board decision concerning a law enforcement officer retirement claim. Even though OPM was a party to the case before the Board (it being a retirement dispute), the court directed that the case be remanded for the Board to consider OPM's reconsideration petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, we consider whether the Director was required to seek reconsideration of the Board's decision before he could petition this court for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute plainly states that the Director must petition the Board for reconsideration. The question here is whether that requirement is waived when OPM was one of the parties before the Board. We conclude that the requirement was not waived. First, the parties are arguably different. Before the Board, the agency, OPM, was the party. In contrast, &#x00A7; 7703(d) requires the Director of OPM to petition for reconsideration. Second, OPM's role at the Board was to defend its denial of Ferrier's retirement claim. The Director's role here, in contrast, is broader based. The Director is concerned with the impact of the decision on the administration of the civil service as a whole. The statutory scheme requiring the Director to seek reconsideration provides the Director with an opportunity to set forth his concerns and an opportunity for the decisionmaker to consider them before judicial review. In that regard, a remand to the Board is warranted. <span class="Italic">Cf. Newman v. Corrado</span>, 897 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (arbitrator required on remand to receive and consider merits of OPM's reconsideration petition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM must seek reconsideration from an arbitrator before seeking review in court of the arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newman v. Corrado</span>, 897 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (discussed in Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-081.html#sec17-77">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>") . In <span class="Italic">King v. Moir</span>, 33 F.3d 65, 1994 WL 371718 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (NP). Mr. Moir, who was employed by OPM, was discharged and grieved his dismissal through arbitration. The arbitrator reinstated him. OPM sought court review. The Federal Circuit required the Director of OPM to seek reconsideration before the arbitrator as a condition to a judicial review petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the circumstances are unusual here because OPM was a party to the arbitral proceeding. Nonetheless, a plain reading of the statute mandates that the Director seek reconsideration of the arbitrator's decision before he seeks judicial review. OPM's role at the arbitration hearing, like any agency's role, was to defend its removal action. There was no underlying issue of impact on the civil service system as a whole. The Director's role here, in contrast, is broader based. The statutory scheme requiring OPM to seek reconsideration provides the Director with an opportunity to set forth his concerns and the decisionmaker to consider them before judicial review. Giving the parties an opportunity to argue the merits of the decision may be particularly beneficial in this case in view of the Director's argument that the arbitrator based his decision on grounds not advocated by either party. In that regard, a remand to the arbitrator is warranted. <span class="Italic">See Newman v. Corrado</span>, 897 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (arbitrator required on remand to receive and consider merits of OPM's reconsideration petition).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The purpose of the OPM reconsideration process is to ensure that the Director has an opportunity to present his views to the Board as to laws within the jurisdiction of OPM. Although OPM must seek reconsideration of a Board decision before seeking review in the appellate courts, nothing requires the Board to grant that reconsideration. The Board is given a chance to correct its errors before its decision is subjected to judicial review. <span class="Italic">Horner v. Burns</span>, 783 F.2d 196 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 527, 530 (1997) (OPM Director has the right under 5 USC 7703(d) to petition the Board for reconsideration where OPM has been an original party in proceedings before the Board); <span class="Italic">Andrada v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 226, 228 (1997) (OPM Director has the statutory right to petition for reconsideration in appeals where OPM was earlier a party).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier law, the Board was not required under 5 USC 7703(d) to reconsider a decision in an appeal if OPM participated in the underlying proceeding either as an original party or as an intervenor. <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 23 MSPR 417, 418 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alexander v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 571, 574-75 (1997) (noting that the <span id="Page_1807"></span>Board overruled its precedent concluding that the Director of OPM was not entitled to petition the Board for reconsideration when OPM was an original party in the Board proceeding); <span class="Italic">Lary v.

OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 441, 443 (1985) (citing <span class="Italic">O'Brien v. OPM</span>, 23 MSPR 579, 580 (1984) ("[W]hen OPM has participated in a Board proceeding either as an intervenor or, as in this case, an original party, [the Board has already considered OPM's views, and] the Director is not entitled to reconsideration[.]")); <span class="Italic">Shirley v. OPM</span>, 27 MSPR 640 (1985) (noting prior law, <span class="Italic">O'Brien</span>, holding that the OPM Director was not entitled to reconsideration under &#x00A7; 7703(d) when it had participated earlier in the Board case as an intervenor or as a party). The avoidance of OPM reconsideration requests when OPM participated in the underlying case came under criticism by the Board's Chairman in a dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Short v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 652, 652-54 (1995), a retirement case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM's concerns about a Board order should be raised through a petition for reconsideration, not in a subsequent motion to intervene. <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 25 MSPR 444, 445 n.* (1984). Conversely, if OPM seeks to become involved in an appeal remanded to a regional office, the proper vehicle is through intervention, not through a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Van Duzer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 202, 204 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v.

The decision ordering the remand is interlocutory, not final, for purposes of the reconsideration procedure. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 278, 279 (1988). When the Board issued an order remanding a case to the region, and OPM sought reconsideration, the Board took the position that reconsideration was inappropriate because no final order was issued. OPM's request for reconsideration was treated as a motion for intervention. The Board then decided the issue presented by the intervenor before sending the case back to the region on remand. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 44 MSPR 635, 637 (1990); <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 278, 279 (1988) (the same approach as <span class="Italic">Brown</span>); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 607, 618 (1996) (declining to permit OPM to intervene in proceedings following remand from 63 MSPR 607 (1996), because OPM did not seek to intervene as early as practicable following a decision on remand), <span class="Italic">on reconsideration</span>, 78 MSPR 38 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">LaChance v.

<p class="Body-Text">The reconsideration process invoked by OPM is for review of MSPB decisions. A notice of appeal rights tacked onto a Board decision is not, according to the Board, part of the "decision" and, therefore, OPM may not appropriately petition the Board for reconsideration of the content of the Board's notice to the appellant of his appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reid v.

<p class="Body-Text">A settlement agreement between the parties reached after a Board final decision is final does not moot an intervening OPM reconsideration request, and the Board apparently will not vacate its decision as a result of the settlement to remove the basis for the OPM reconsideration request, <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 66 MSPR 571, 573 (1995) (on OPM's petition for reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539 (1994)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]his case is not moot because the agreement between the appellant and the agency does not affect the matter currently pending before the Board, OPM's petition for reconsideration. OPM has a statutory right to seek reconsideration and judicial review of a final decision of the Board which is not affected by an agreement of the other parties to settle their dispute. OPM's independent standing to appeal under section 7703(d) was recognized in <span class="Italic">Horner v. MSPB</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 670-71 (Fed. Cir. 1987), where the court found the case was not rendered moot by a settlement agreement between the Special Counsel and the respondent employee who were the original parties before the Board. Similarly, the post-decision agreement of the original parties here to resolve the appellant's fee motion and other potential disputes concerning the relief ordered does not affect OPM's authority to request reconsideration of a precedential decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that, if the Board were to grant the motion to vacate its decision, the basis for OPM's petition would be removed. However, the appellant and the agency have not provided an adequate reason for the Board to vacate its decision. The appellant's relinquishment of her right to appeal unfavorable rulings in the Board's decision in light of the parties' settlement of what remains of their dispute is not a ground for vacating the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Company v. Bonner Mall Partnership</span>, __U.S.__, __, 115 S. Ct. 386, 393, 130 L. Ed.2d 233 (1994) ("[M]ootness by reason of settlement does not justify vacatur of a judgment under review").</p>
