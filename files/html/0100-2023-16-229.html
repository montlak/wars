<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-229"><span class="space">e.</span> EEO Investigative Interview</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA, OHA and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 59 FLRA 875, 878-80 (2004) (<span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>) (reconsideration granted on other grounds, 60 FLRA 105 (2004)) determined that extensive interviews conducted by a contract investigator charged with compiling a record relating to an employee's EEO complaint constituted a formal discussions requiring notice to the union and an opportunity for the union to be present at the interviews:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 306; <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, 54 FLRA at 723; <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated in <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, in order to determine whether meetings constitute formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined and the following illustrative factors are considered: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) the length of the discussions; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 307.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will apply these factors to each of the three meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Whether the Discussions Were Formal</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Meeting 1 (Rosanne Moore) (Case No. BN-CA-02-0266)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Michael Gear, an investigator for the contractor, called Rosanne Moore, a unit employee at the Manchester Office of Hearings and Appeals, at her office and identified himself. He asked Moore if she had knowledge of what another unit employee who had filed a formal EEO complaint did for work. Next, Gear asked Moore if she had knowledge of the other employee's problems with management and Moore said she had no first-hand knowledge. Gear then asked Moore what her position was. After Moore told him, he began asking questions about Moore's performance. At this point, Moore told Gear that she did not see the relevance of this line of questions. Gear declined to explain the relevance and Moore terminated the call.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying the seven factors in <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 307, we find that this phone conversation did not constitute a formal discussion based on the totality of the circumstances. In particular, we find that this conversation was not formal since the interview was not scheduled in advance, took place in the employee's private office, was terminated by the employee, and was not documented by affidavit or confirming letter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harry S. Truman Memorial, Veterans Hospital, Columbia, Missouri</span>, 16 FLRA 1049, 1051 (1984) (Authority found discussion not formal that was held in first-line supervisor's office, called in an impromptu manner without formal advance written notice, lasting a few moments, without a formal agenda and without transcript of meeting); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332 (1992) (Authority found meeting not formal where it was held on the shop floor, lasted 10 minutes, only the first-line supervisor attended the meeting, no agenda was prepared and no notes were taken). Accordingly, we dismiss the complaint as to this allegation, without addressing the parties' other arguments.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We note that in finding that this interview was not formal, we do not rely, as the Respondent does, on <span class="Italic">SSA, NY Region</span>. As the General Counsel correctly notes, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Luke I</span> that it would no longer follow <span class="Italic">SSA, NY Region</span> to the extent that it "implies that a facilitated discussion in general,...can never be 'formal' under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute[.]" <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, 54 FLRA at 729. The Authority further stated that the Union's representation right under the Statute "is not diminished when the discussion between employees and agency representatives is conducted in a nonconfrontational manner through a neutral third party." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We note that unlike the instant case, as discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the Authority in <span class="Italic">Luke I</span> declined to address the status of the facilitator as an agency representative under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) since the agency conceded that it was represented at all times by a JAG attorney during these meetings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Meeting 2 (Colleen Barry) (Case No. BN-CA-02-0434)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 28, Dyanne Engberg, an investigator for the contractor, sent an e-mail to Colleen Barry, a unit employee in the Somerville Office, in which she explained that she needed to interview Barry about the formal complaint filed by another unit employee, and gave her an option of being interviewed by telephone at work or at home. Barry replied that she would prefer being interviewed at home and an appointment was made for January 30 at 6:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> The telephone interview lasted about twenty minutes and, with Barry's knowledge, was tape-recorded. Engberg told Barry that she would be sending her a statement of their conversation so that she could make any corrections, sign it, and return the statement to Engberg. On March 1, Engberg e-mailed Barry a statement based on their January 30 conversation, and the statement was accurate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this conversation constituted a formal discussion within the meaning of the Statute.&#x2003;Unlike the telephone conversation involving Moore, Barry had advance notice of the topic of the conversation; the interview was tape-recorded; and a statement describing the conversation was prepared and given to Barry, who agreed that it was accurate. These circumstances demonstrate that this discussion was formal. <span class="Italic">See United States Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, El Paso, Tex.</span>, 47 FLRA 170, 183 (1993) (<span class="Italic">INS, El Paso</span>) (Authority found that depositions conducted by agency in preparation for MSPB proceedings were formal discussions); <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span>, 41 FLRA at 1379-80 (Authority found that telephone interviews conducted by the agency's attorney were formal discussions given the employee's advance notice of the interview and that such interview was mandatory).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;Meeting 3 (Kathy Houba-Kane) (Case No. BN-CA-02-0434)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In late winter of 2001, Engberg sent an e-mail to Kathy Houba-Kane, a unit employee in the Somerville Office, stating that she needed to interview her in connection with a formal EEO complaint. Houba-Kane responded that she would prefer being interviewed by phone at home and Engberg arranged a time a few days later for the interview. Engberg called, told <span id="page_1498"></span>her that the conversation would be recorded and promised to send a copy to her home address. Engberg did not send a copy to Houba-Kane's home address, but Houba-Kane did receive the statement by e-mail at work a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that this conversation, like the one with Barry, constituted a formal discussion within the meaning of the Statute. Unlike the telephone conversation involving Moore, Houba-Kane had advance notice of the topic of the conversation; the interview was tape-recorded; and a statement describing the conversation was prepared and given to Houba-Kane. These circumstances demonstrate that this discussion was formal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">INS, El Paso</span> and <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span> cited above.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite finding that these two conversations constituted formal discussions, the Judge dismissed the complaint because he found that the Union had received actual knowledge of the interviews from Barry and Houba-Kane before the interviews and had the opportunity to be represented at their interviews. The General Counsel takes exception to the dismissal of the complaint based on these findings on the grounds that: (1) the record does not reflect when either of the two employees spoke with the Union representative in relation to the interview; (2) even if the Union had actual notice of the interviews, there is no record support for the Judge's conclusion that the Union had an opportunity to be present at the interviews; and (3) the Respondent never raised the defense of actual notice, and the Judge's dismissal of the complaint on a basis that was never raised by the Judge prevented the parties from having the opportunity to properly litigate the issue at the hearing and thereby violated due process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We need not resolve whether the record supports the Judge's conclusions that the Union had actual notice of the interviews and had an opportunity to be present at them, because we agree with the General Counsel that the Judge erred by resolving the complaint on a basis that was not raised by the Respondent. It is clear from the record, as the General Counsel asserts, that the Respondent never raised the defense that the Union had actual notice and an opportunity to be present at these interviews. The Authority has specifically held that "[i]f a party fails to raise a defense before the judge, then the judge errs by resolving the case on the basis of that defense." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 56 FLRA 696, 698 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>). Accordingly, we find that the Judge erred in this case by dismissing the complaint on a basis that was not raised by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Status of the EEO Investigators as Agency Representatives</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge and the General Counsel that the EEO investigators were representatives of the Respondent within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy,</span> the Authority found that a contractor performing the role of an Employee Assistance Program Counselor was "functioning as the 'representative of the agency,' within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute when [the contractor] conducted the orientation meetings with the Respondent's employees[,]" as part of its Employee Assistance Program (EAP). 39 FLRA at 1013.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 527 U.S. 229 (1999), in holding that an inspector general can constitute a representative of an agency under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), noted that "[a]s an organization, an agency must rely on a variety of representatives to carry out its functions and, though acting in different capacities, each may be acting for, and on behalf of, the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 236. As relevant here, the court found that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) was "not limited to agency investigators representing an 'entity' that collectively bargains with the employee's union." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 237. The Court also affirmed as consistent with the Statute the Authority's rationale that a contrary finding--that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) did not encompass investigations by an inspector general--"might erode the right by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent policy of protecting certain federal employees when they are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In terms of the application of these principles to the contract investigators in this case, we find that the investigators were agency representatives in conducting these investigations at the bequest and on behalf of the Respondent in investigating the EEO complaints. We note that the "Letter of Authorization for Investigative Services" addressed to all SSA employees was signed by the Respondent's OCREO Director and directed employees to "provide...complete cooperation since the investigator has been given authority to conduct such investigation, inquiry or review into matters raised in an EEO complaint." The letter further states that "information/documentation collected by the investigator will be done in accordance with contract requirements[,]" and that the "purpose of th[is] investigation is to gather facts upon which to base a determination as to whether the Agency has violated an EEO statute, and if a violation is found, to have sufficient factual information from which to fashion an appropriate remedy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On this basis, we find that contrary to the assertions of the Respondent, its relationship with these investigators is not "tenuous" as control and direction of these investigators emanate from the contract between the Southwind Corporation and the Respondent. The Respondent had an official obligation to investigate these EEO complaints, and the fact that a contractor, rather than an agency employee, was designated by the agency to conduct these investigations does not diminish the relationship with the Respondent. As in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, we have the same concerns here that finding that these contract investigators are not agency representatives would encourage agencies to contract out of as much as of the EEO complaint process to avoid granting unions their statutory right to representation at formal discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we find that consistent with <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span> and <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, the contract investigators were agency representatives within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Investigatory Interviews Concerned a "Grievance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's exception to the Judge's conclusion that these interviews involving EEO complaints concerned a grievance within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority has already addressed and resolved this issue. As noted recently in <span class="Italic">United States, Dep't of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 58 FLRA 528, 533 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Luke II</span>) (Member Armendariz concurring and Chairman Cabaniss dissenting), the Authority has "revisited and thoroughly reviewed the issue of whether EEO complaints pursued through a statutory appeals procedure are grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and decided to adhere to its view that the scope of the term 'grievance' encompasses such complaints, based on the express language of the Statute, legislative history of the Statute, and the purpose of the Statute's provision for union representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 308-09). As relevant here, in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, the Authority reaffirmed its holdings in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>that were affirmed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span>, that the "broad definition of 'grievance' under the Statute encompasses complaints filed under a negotiated grievance procedure as well as complaints filed under alternative statutory procedures of the EEOC." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span> and <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, we reject the Respondent's exception in this regard. The Respondent relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB v. FLRA</span>, which has been rejected by the Authority, and the Respondent presents no new arguments that merit reconsideration of or departure from the Authority's view.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Member Armendariz notes, consistent with his concurrence in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, that there is no evidence or claim by the Respondent that the Union waived its representation rights to such interviews based on the exclusion of EEO claims from coverage under the negotiated grievance procedure. In fact, according to the Respondent, in this case the parties have not excluded EEO claims from the coverage of the parties' negotiated grievance procedures. Also, consistent with his concurrence in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, Member Armendariz notes that there is no evidence of direct conflict between a union's institutional rights and an employee's right to confidentiality. In this case, the record reflects that both Barry and Houba-Kane apprised and discussed with the Union their interviews with the contract investigators. As such, there is no evidence that these employees would have objected to the presence of the Union at these interviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, in these circumstances, we find that the Respondent committed unfair labor practices alleged in the complaint by failing to provide under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) the Union notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, the formal discussions with Barry and Houba-Kane in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Reaffirming AFGE Local 1164</span> (<span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>), <span class="Italic">supra,</span> EEO interviews undertaken, even by an agency contractor, as part of an EEO investigation constitute formal discussions qualifying for notice to the union and an opportunity for the union to be present during the interviews, conducted pursuant to written notice by, and with an advance list of questions from, the investigator, and recorded, <span class="Italic">PBGC and NAGE Local R3-77</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-048.html">62 FLRA 219</a>, 221-25 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">SSA Boston, </span>59 FLRA at 878 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's finding that the interviews were discussions within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). The Respondent asserts that the interviews concerned only the employees' knowledge of facts concerning a formal complaint of discrimination and that no actual discussion occurred. Contrary to the Respondent's contention, we find that the Judge was correct when he concluded that "the facts and law leave little doubt that they were[&#8197;]" discussions. As the Judge correctly found, the interviews contained detailed exchanges of information between the witnesses and the contractor, and there need not be any debate between the participants in order to qualify as a "discussion" <span id="page_1499"></span>under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Inst., Bastrop, Tex.,</span> 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996) ("[t]he term 'discussion' in the Statute is synonymous with 'meeting' and no actual discussion or dialogue need occur for the meeting to constitute a discussion within the meaning of the Statute[&#8197;]," (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Tex.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does not specifically except to the Judge's finding that the discussions were "formal." In any event, the Judge's finding in this regard is supported by substantial evidence in the record. In order to determine whether meetings constitute formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined and the following illustrative factors are considered: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) the length of the discussions; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">SSA Boston, </span>59 FLRA at 878 (citation omitted). The Judge properly applied these factors and concluded, based on the stipulated record, that the discussions were formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Judge did not err in finding that the discussions constituted formal discussions within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's conclusion that the contractor who served as the Respondent's EEO investigator was acting as a "representative of the agency" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Respondent also asserts that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span> in relying on <span class="Italic">NASA</span> and <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge found and the parties acknowledge, the facts of this case are indistinguishable from those of <span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>, in which the Authority held that a contractor serving as an EEO investigator for the agency was a representative of the agency within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). In <span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> the Authority stated as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We agree with the Judge and the General Counsel that the EEO investigators were representatives of the Respondent within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy,</span> the Authority found that a contractor performing the role of an Employee Assistance Program Counselor was "functioning as the 'representative of the agency,' within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute when [the contractor] conducted the orientation meetings with the Respondent's employees[,]" as part of its Employee Assistance Program (EAP). 39 FLRA at 1013.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Also, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 527 U.S. 229 (1999), in holding that an inspector general can constitute a representative of an agency under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), noted that "[a]s an organization, an agency must rely on a variety of representatives to carry out its functions and, though acting in different capacities, each may be acting for, and on behalf of, the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 236.

The Court also affirmed as consistent with the Statute the Authority's rationale that a contrary finding--that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) did not encompass investigations by an inspector general--"might erode the right by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent policy of protecting certain federal employees when they are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In terms of the application of these principles to the contract investigators in this case, we find that the investigators were agency representatives in conducting these investigations at the bequest and on behalf of the Respondent in investigating the EEO complaints. We note that the "Letter of Authorization for Investigative Services" addressed to all SSA employees was signed by the Respondent's OCREO Director and directed employees to "provide...complete cooperation since the investigator has been given authority to conduct such investigation, inquiry or review into matters raised in an EEO complaint." The letter further states that "information/documentation collected by the investigator will be done in accordance with contract requirements[,]" and that the "purpose of th[is] investigation is to gather facts upon which to base a determination as to whether the Agency has violated an EEO statute, and if a violation is found, to have sufficient factual information from which to fashion an appropriate remedy."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On this basis, we find that contrary to the assertions of the Respondent, its relationship with these investigators is not "tenuous" as control and direction of these investigators emanate from the contract between the [contractor's employer] and the Respondent. The Respondent had an official obligation to investigate these EEO complaints, and the fact that a contractor, rather than an agency employee, was designated by the agency to conduct these investigations does not diminish the relationship with the Respondent. As in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, we have the same concerns here that finding that these contract investigators are not agency representatives would encourage agencies to contract out of as much as of the EEO complaint process to avoid granting unions their statutory right to representation at formal discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Thus, we find that consistent with <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span> and <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, the contract investigators were agency representatives within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> 59 FLRA at 879-80.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> the Memo from the Respondent appointing the contractor directed employees to "provide complete cooperation in the investigation[&#8197;]" and required them "to furnish testimony under oath, without a pledge of confidence, about matters pertaining to the complaint. Further, the Memo authorized the contractor to use the Respondent's facilities and directed him to provide weekly reports to the Respondent's EEO Manager and to submit the complete investigative file to the Respondent. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> the Respondent's relationship with the contractor was with control and direction of the contractor emanating from the contract between the Respondent and the contractor. In these circumstances, the Authority's conclusion in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston </span>applies equally as well here: "The Respondent had an official obligation to investigate these EEO complaints, and the fact that a contractor, rather than an agency employee, was designated by the agency to conduct these investigations does not diminish the relationship with the Respondent." <span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> 59 FLRA at 880.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to <span class="Italic">NASA,</span> the Authority correctly set forth the Supreme Court's findings and rationale in support of its holding that an inspector general can constitute a representative of the agency as that term is set forth in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). The same term--representative of the agency--is used in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). The Authority has "recognized that, under general rules of statutory construction, there is a presumption that the same words used twice in the same statute have the same meaning." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transportation, FAA Anchorage, Alaska</span>, 61 FLRA 176, (2005) (citations omitted). Here, particularly where the same term is used in subsections of the same statutory section and there is no legislative history indicating otherwise, it is proper to give the same terms the same meaning. As such, it was appropriate for the Authority to rely on the Court's statement that "[a]s an organization, an agency must rely on a variety of representatives to carry out its functions and, though acting in different capacities, each may be acting for, and on behalf of, the agency[&#8197;]" (<span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 236), and the Court's finding that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) was "not limited to agency investigators representing an 'entity' that collectively bargains with the employee's union," <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 237.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority properly relied on the Court's affirmance of the Authority's rationale concerning the erosion of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rights. In particular, the Court's affirmance, as consistent with the Statute, the Authority's rationale that a contrary finding that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) did not encompass investigations by an inspector general, "might erode the right by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent policy of protecting certain federal employees when they are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action[&#8197;]" (<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 234). As to this last point, a finding that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) did not encompass EEO investigations by contractors could similarly erode the policy established in that statutory provision granting exclusive representatives the opportunity to be represented at formal discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span>, nothing in the Authority's decision, which agreed with the reasoning of the judge in that case, indicates that the contractor's neutrality, or the lack thereof, was relevant to the Authority's finding that a contractor was a "representative of the agency" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 39 FLRA at 1013. Rather, as argued by the GC in its opposition, the Authority's finding in <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span> was based on an application of the same factors that the Authority applied in SSA Boston: whether the contractor was performing a function that otherwise would have been performed by the agency, and whether the respondent exercised any control over the contractor. Similarly, in the instant case, the contractor was performing a function that otherwise would have been performed by the Respondent in accordance with applicable regulations. Further, <span class="Italic">Defense Depot Tracy</span> and the instant case are similar in that, in both cases, the contractors were assisted by the respective agencies and the employees were required to attend the meetings with the contractors. The fact that the contractor in <span class="Italic">SSA Boston</span>, like the contractor here, was required to remain neutral did not preclude or otherwise affect the Authority's finding that he served as a representative of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(A) requires that a union be given an opportunity to be present at certain discussions involving "one or more representatives <span id="page_1500"></span>of the agency." Contrary to the Judge's comments, relied on by the Respondent, nothing in the Statute distinguishes between such a representative serving a "prosecutorial role," a "personnel function," or a "neutral function." Moreover, the Judge's acknowledgement that unions have a right to attend discussions involving "personnel functions" undercuts the Respondent's claim that the neutrality of a representative insulates an agency from this statutory requirement, as personnel functions may, in many instances, be characterized as neutral.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Respondent's reliance on EEOC guidance indicating that EEO investigators may not serve as "representatives" of agencies is misplaced. EEO Guidance MD-110, Ch. 1. par. vi. The EEOC guidance requires that each agency set up independent lines of authority for its EEO and personnel programs to assure the independence of the EEO process and to avoid "intrusion on the investigations and deliberations of EEO complaints by agency representatives and offices responsible for defending the agency against EEO complaints." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at par. III. The guidance thus uses the term "representative" in a particular context, that of agency advocate, and does not imply that employees serving under the EEO function are not, in a general sense, representing an agency's interests. As the regulations that govern EEO investigations make clear, these investigations are "conducted by the Agency," in accordance with EEOC directives. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, nothing in the Statute or the Authority's case law indicates that the application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) turns on the factors found significant by the dissent. In this regard, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) provides a union the right to be present at "any formal discussion" concerning a grievance. Further, as the dissent notes, the Authority has described this section as providing "the union" with the opportunity to safeguard both "its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit...." <span class="Italic">United States Dept. of Justice, Immigration and Naturalizations Serv.,</span> 55 FLRA 1032, 1037 (1999) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>). While, as <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> suggests, the interests of the employee and union may be particularly strong where the union is providing representation to an employee who believes he or she has been wronged, there is nothing in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> or the Statute that limits the union's right to that circumstance. Certainly, where the discussion at issue meets the various requirements of the Statute, there is no basis for denying the union access based on such circumstances as the "fact-finding" nature of the meeting, the fact that the employee is a "witness," or the fact that the union representative has not been "designated" by the employee. Rather, as our case law holds, those circumstances which indicate that the requirements of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) are, or are not, met, should be taken into account. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, 436th Airlift Wing, Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware,</span> 57 FLRA 304, 307 (2001); <span class="Italic">aff'd Dover Air Force Base v. FLRA,</span> 316 F.3d 280 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (setting out factual circumstances indicating that discussion is "formal").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the contractor who served as the Respondent's EEO Investigator was a representative of the Agency within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's exception to the Judge's conclusion that these interviews involving EEO complaints concerned a grievance within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. As the Judge correctly found, "[t]his precise issue has been thoroughly litigated in recent years...and the Authority has made its position clear...that formal EEO complaints processed under 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 or other statutory appeal procedures constitute 'grievances' within the meaning of the Statute." In this regard, the Authority stated the following in SSA Boston:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority has already addressed and resolved this issue. As noted recently in <span class="Italic">United States, Dep't of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span>, 58 FLRA 528, 533 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Luke II</span>) (Member Armendariz concurring and Chairman Cabaniss dissenting), the Authority has "revisited and thoroughly reviewed the issue of whether EEO complaints pursued through a statutory appeals procedure are grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and decided to adhere to its view that the scope of the term 'grievance' encompasses such complaints, based on the express language of the Statute, legislative history of the Statute, and the purpose of the Statute's provision for union representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 308-09). As relevant here, in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, the Authority reaffirmed its holdings in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>that were affirmed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span>, that the "broad definition of 'grievance' under the Statute encompasses complaints filed under a negotiated grievance procedure as well as complaints filed under alternative statutory procedures of the EEOC." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Thus, for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span> and <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, we reject the Respondent's exception in this regard. The Respondent relies on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB v. FLRA</span>, which has been rejected by the Authority, and the Respondent presents no new arguments that merit reconsideration of or departure from the Authority's view.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA Boston,</span> 59 FLRA at 880-81 (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting). The Respondent in this case has presented no new arguments that merit reconsideration of, or departure from, the Authority's view. Accordingly, we reject the Respondent's exception as to this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, based on the above, we find that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute as alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management was required to notify the union of interviews conducted by the agency EEO director, who desired to question employees during an EEO investigation initiated as a result of an anonymous letter sent to the agency's general counsel. The union waives its right to be represented at interviews of nontargeted employees when the EEO director informs union officers of her intent to question nontargeted employees and of the purpose of the interviews, the union officials indicate no desire to participate in the interviews, and the questions asked do not vary materially among interviews. <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBPA</span>, 46 FLRA 107, 111-12 (1992). Refer to the General Counsel's Memorandum of January 26, 1999, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Applying the Requirements of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to Processing Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints and Bargaining over Equal Employment Opportunity Matters</span> for additional guidance on the representational rights during EEO proceedings and settlements.
