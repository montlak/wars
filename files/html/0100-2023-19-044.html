<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-44"><span class="space">3.</span> Religion</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Religious discrimination cases involve allegations either of disparate treatment or, as in disability cases [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-055.html#sec12-53">Rehabilitation Act: Disabling Conditions</a>"], failure to provide accommodation for the exercise of religious beliefs. <span class="Italic">Reed v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 76 MSPR 126, 130-34 (1997), analyzed both types of allegations. Appellant was an air traffic control specialist who was fired when he declined to work on several Saturdays because he observed the Sabbath in accordance with his religious beliefs. The Board's decision explained the accommodation and disparate treatment elements of the ensuing religious discrimination affirmative defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employees may use two theories in asserting Title VII religious discrimination claims. Under the "disparate treatment" theory, an employee must demonstrate through the use of direct or circumstantial evidence that the employer treated him differently than other employees because of his religious beliefs; the evidentiary burdens placed on the employee under this theory mirror those placed on employees alleging employment discrimination based on race or sex. <span class="Italic">See Chalmers v. Tulon Co. of Richmond</span>, 101 F.3d 1012, 1017-18 (4th Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">petition for cert. filed</span>, 65 U.S.L.W. 3815 (U.S. April 16, 1997) (No. 96-1874); <span class="Italic">Mann v. Frank</span>, 7 F.3d 1365, 1370 (8th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Ramagopal v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, EEOC Petition No. 03940164, slip op. at 6-7 (Nov. 29, 1994). Under the "reasonable accommodation" theory, an employee can establish a claim even though he cannot show that other (unprotected) employees were treated more favorably or rebut an employer's legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his discharge. The employer must still actively attempt to accommodate the employee's religious expression or conduct, to an extent, even if the reasons for his discharge were otherwise proper. <span class="Italic">See Chalmers</span>, 101 F.3d at 1018.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had established his Title VII claim under a "reasonable accommodation" theory and thus did not reach his "disparate treatment" allegations. The agency would be liable here under Title VII for failure to accommodate the appellant's religious practices or beliefs absent proof that such accommodation could not have been made without imposing an undue hardship upon its operations. <span class="Italic">See Trans</span> <span class="Italic">World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 72-75, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 2270-72, 53 L. Ed.2d 113 (1977); <span class="Italic">Wright v. Runyon</span>, 2 F.3d 214, 216 (7th Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 510 U.S. 1121, 114 S. Ct. 1077, 127 L. Ed.2d 394 (1994). To make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination, the appellant had to show that: (1) He had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicted with an employment requirement; (2) he informed the agency of the belief; and (3) he was disciplined for failure to comply with the conflicting requirement. <span class="Italic">See Turpen v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</span>, 736 F.2d 1022, 1026 (5th Cir. 1984). If the appellant made that showing, the agency in turn had to prove that accommodating his beliefs would have required it to bear more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost and thus would have constituted an undue hardship<span class="Italic">. See Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 84, 97 S. Ct. at 2276-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination under Title VII, and the agency has not challenged that finding on petition for review. He also found, however, that the agency had not shown that it had reasonably accommodated the appellant's beliefs or that such accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship upon its operations. In making this finding, he noted that the agency had successfully accommodated the appellant's work-schedule conflict with Sabbath observance until it unexpectedly lost a number of air traffic controllers and therefore faced a significant staff shortage at its Pueblo, Colorado, ATCT in the spring of 1995. The administrative judge determined that the circumstances which led to the shortage were largely outside the control of the Pueblo ATCT's management or even of the Western Region of which the Pueblo ATCT was a part. He also accepted the assertions of Pueblo ATCT officials that they had made good-faith although unavailing efforts to secure more staff for the facility and to use overtime for coverage of the appellant's Saturday shifts; in fact, he appears to have conceded that the agency could not have accommodated the appellant's Sabbath observance given its existing staffing level at the Pueblo ATCT.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency had not satisfied its duty of reasonable accommodation, however, the administrative judge noted the testimony of an agency official that the staffing level at the Pueblo ATCT had increased by February or March of 1996, and he concluded that the agency thus could now probably accommodate the appellant's Sabbath observance (as it had in the past) because it had an adequate complement of air traffic controllers. The administrative judge also noted that a Pueblo ATCT official had conceded that the facility's staffing level for air traffic controllers at the time of the appellant's removal was below the level set by an agreement reached by the agency and the appellant's union regarding facility staffing. The administrative judge admitted that the reasons for this shortfall were entirely unforeseen but nonetheless found that "the agency as a whole" could have taken steps to staff the Pueblo ATCT at the authorized controller level; in failing to do so, he reasoned, it had failed to accommodate the appellant's religious beliefs, and its AWOL charge could not stand. The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in reaching this result. For the reasons set forth below, we agree and reverse the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was assigned Tuesday and Wednesday as his scheduled days off in accordance with bidding procedures set by the collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the union. Absent some underlying discriminatory purpose, however, the operation of a contractually-bargained system for allocating days off that is neutral on its face cannot be an unlawful employment practice even if such a system has some discriminatory consequences. <span class="Italic">See Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 80-82, 97 S. Ct. at 2274-76. The emphasis of Title VII is on proscribing religious discrimination whether it is directed against majorities or minorities; it therefore does not require an employer to carve out a special exception to such a neutral system in order to help an employee to meet his Sabbath obligations when that action would occur at the expense of other employees who had strong, but perhaps nonreligious, reasons for not working on weekends. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 81-83, 97 S. Ct. at 2275-76. Requiring an employer to make such an exception and restructure its employment practices is also questionable where (as here) its business involves the safeguarding of lives and property. <span class="Italic">See Beadle v. City of</span> <span class="Italic">Tampa</span>, 42 F.3d 633, 637-38 (11th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 515 U.S. 1152, 115 S. Ct. 2600, 132 L. Ed.2d 846 (1995). While the operation here of neutral, contractually-bargained bidding procedures for days off thus may unfortunately have denied the appellant his preference for not working on the Sabbath, such a denial alone does not establish that the agency discriminated against him in violation of Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge essentially found that the agency had failed in its duty to accommodate the appellant's religious beliefs when it did not hire more air traffic controllers to do the work at the <span id="Page_3387"></span>Pueblo ATCT. Any cost in efficiency or wage expenditures that is more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, however, constitutes an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Lee v. ABF Freight System, Inc.</span>, 22 F.3d 1019, 1023 (10th Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 7 F.3d at 1369. More specifically, an employer is not required under Title VII to hire an additional worker to accommodate an employee's scheduling conflict with religious obligations; the cost of doing so amounts to an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">See Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 84-85, 97 S. Ct. at 2276-77; <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 22 F.3d at 1023; <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Oak Rubber Co.</span>, 15 F.3d 1375, 1380 (6th Cir. 1994). The agency here thus was not obliged to hire more air traffic controllers to accommodate the appellant's religious beliefs. The fact that the agency was able to obtain more air traffic controllers for the Pueblo ATCT several months after the appellant's removal, moreover, does not mean that it was legally required to incur the costs associated with the addition of even one employee at the time of that removal<span class="Italic">. See Cooper</span>, 15 F.3d at 1380. Because the record establishes that such an accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship on the agency's operations, then, the appellant's "reasonable accommodation" Title VII claim must fail. <span class="Italic">See Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. at 84-85, 97 S. Ct. at 2276-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge never reached the appellant's, "disparate treatment" Title VII claim. The appellant alleged below that his discharge occurred because agency employees were "biased" against his religious beliefs; under the agency's contrasting version of events, it did not discriminate against the appellant but instead "bent over backwards" to accommodate him until it could no longer do so without causing an undue hardship to the agency. The conflict between these two accounts primarily involves the question of whether the deciding official (Mr. Hof) treated the appellant more harshly than other employees because of the former's discriminatory intent. A determination on this issue thus obviously requires the resolution of disputed questions of fact. We therefore find it appropriate to remand the case so that the administrative judge may decide these questions of fact in the first instance and adjudicate the appellant's remaining Title VII claim based on the existing record<span class="Italic">. See Spithaler v. OPM</span>, 2 MSPB 2, 1 MSPR 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material factual and legal issues, summarize the evidence, resolve credibility issues, and include the administrative judge's legal reasoning and conclusions, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We offer the following guidance for the administrative judge's consideration on remand. As noted above, the appellant's disparate treatment claim may be established by direct or circumstantial evidence of discriminatory intent. <span class="Italic">See Chalmers</span>, 101 F.3d at 1017-18; <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 7 F.3d at 1370; <span class="Italic">Ramagopal</span>, slip op. at 6-7. If the appellant has failed to provide direct evidence of discriminatory intent, he may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on circumstantial evidence by showing that he engaged in prohibited conduct similar to that of a person outside his protected class, and that disciplinary measures enforced against him were more severe than those enforced against the other person. The burden of proof would then shift to the agency to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions; if the agency meets that burden, the appellant bears the ultimate burden of showing that the reasons offered by the agency were not the true reasons for its actions but merely pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Chalmers</span>, 101 F.3d at 1017-18; <span class="Italic">Ramagopal</span>, slip op. at 6-7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Shift changes as an accommodation for religious preferences to avoid working on Sabbath days were discussed in <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 78 MSPR 439, 447-48 (1998) (requiring an employee to cooperate in the efforts of the employer and other employees in switching shifts to accommodate the appellant's scheduling preferences). <span class="Italic">Rose v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 139, 147 (1997), <span class="Italic">following remand</span> 78 MSPR 547 (1998), made a modest addition to the Board's analysis of religious accommodative requirements in a compliance case involving a challenged shift change. The Board considered the appellant's assertion that the agency's guidelines on accommodation required the agency to obtain a waiver from the union before declaring that a collective bargaining agreement barred accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not addressed these guidelines.[11] Nor has it addressed the appellant's allegation that it provided religious days off to another employee with less seniority than the appellant. In the absence of specific argument by the agency addressing the appellant's claims we are unable to determine whether its change of the appellant's work schedule was proper. Therefore, to meet its burden on compliance, the agency must address the appellant's argument that it accommodated the religious needs of another employee with less seniority than the appellant and address the meaning and validity of the Guidelines submitted by the appellant.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;We note that on August 14, 1997, the President issued <span class="Italic">Guidelines on Religious</span> <span class="Italic">Exercise and Religious Expression in the Federal Workplace</span> that address accommodation of employees' exercise of their religion. However, we need not consider the effect of this document on the instant case as the Guidelines make clear that they are not intended to create any new substantive or procedural right or benefit. <span class="Italic">See Guidelines,</span> Section 3. General.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;We note that the [USPS] guidelines appear to have been issued prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison,</span> 432 U.S. 63, 78-79, 97 S. Ct. 2264, 2273-74, 53 L. Ed.2d 113 (1977), which held that the duty to accommodate religious beliefs does not require an employer to take steps inconsistent with an otherwise valid collective bargaining agreement and recognized a seniority system itself as an accommodation to the religious and secular needs of all employees. Nevertheless, to the extent that the agency's guidelines concerning accommodation establish an obligation to seek a waiver of the CBA provisions, the Board will enforce that obligation. <span class="Italic">Cf. Humphrey v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army,</span> 76 MSPR 519, 525-526 (1997) (The Board will hold agencies obligated beyond the requirements of the law to provide employees the benefits they have established by policy, rule, or regulation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Inappropriate claims to religious accommodation may lead to nondiscriminatory discipline, <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 78 MSPR 439, 445-46 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency essentially charged the appellant with: (1) Misrepresenting to his crew leader that he had obtained permission from their supervisor to leave work early on a non-Sabbath shift that he had swapped because of his Sabbath obligations; (2) calling in one and one-half hours after his shift on a Sabbath had started, informing the crew leader that he would not be coming to work, and failing to report for work or request leave at that time, resulting in a charge of AWOL; (3) reporting for duty two hours and fifteen minutes after the start of his scheduled 4:15 <small>P.M.</small> shift on a Sabbath, but certifying on a time sheet that he had reported for duty at 4:15 <small>P.M.</small>; and (4) failing to provide administratively acceptable medical documentation to support a request for sick leave during an absence on his Sabbath. The AJ sustained these charges, and the appellant does not contest them on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends, however, that "but for" the agency's alleged failure to reasonably accommodate his religious beliefs, he would not have committed such misconduct. Nevertheless, he does not argue that his religious beliefs required him to make deliberate misrepresentations, fail to request leave according to established procedures, falsify an official document, or refuse to comply with a proper order to submit acceptable medical documentation regarding an absence. <span class="Italic">See</span> HT (Feb. 10, 1997) at 131 (the appellant testified that his refusal to provide further medical documentation had nothing to do with the Sabbath, but was at the advice of counsel), and 161-62 (the appellant testified that the "misunderstanding" regarding his leaving work early on a non-Sabbath shift had nothing to do with the Sabbath). The appellant's religious beliefs merely prevented him from working on his Sabbath. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not met the third element of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of religious discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 01934794 (Sept. 1, 1994) (no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where the employee's failure to call in to report her absence was not caused by her attendance at a religious meeting that triggered the absence); <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Request No. 05910153 (Mar. 27, 1991) (no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where the employee was removed for tardiness, and there was no indication that her tardiness was related to her religious beliefs); <span class="Italic">Shabazz v. Department of the Navy,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03900130 (Jan. 7, 1991) (no <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case where the agency removed the employee for failure to follow leave-requesting procedures, and the employee did not identify any religious practice that conflicted with the procedures the agency established for obtaining leave).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We are mindful of the Supreme Court's statement in <span class="Italic">Ansonia Bd. of Educ. v. Philbrook</span>, 479 U.S. 60, 67-68, 107 S. Ct. 367, 93 L. Ed.2d 305 (1986), a case involving religious accommodation claims, that whether a plaintiff had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination is not relevant once a case is fully tried on the merits. Nevertheless, because 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B) provides that an agency's decision may not be sustained if the employee shows that the decision was "based on" a prohibited personnel practice such as religious discrimination, we address the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to the extent that it includes a "causation" requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Casual remarks in the workplace, intended by the speaker to be jocular, do not establish a personnel action to be discriminatory, even if they carry religious connotations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Meyers v. EEOC</span>, 45 MSPR 488, 491 (1990) (bad joke of a supervisor did not make a performance-based action discriminatory).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board accepted an EEOC finding of religious discrimination in <span class="Italic">Heffernan v. DHHS,</span> 105 MSPR 41, 2007 MSPB 54 (2007), based on the agency's differing treatment of chaplains of two different religious faiths when that distinction in treatment as to training requirements contributed to the appellant's discharge.
