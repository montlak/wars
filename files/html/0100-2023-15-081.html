<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-81"><span class="space">b.</span> Agency Clearance Proceeding</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Executive Order 10450 did not provide for a hearing for employees whose investigations disclosed adverse information used to revoke or deny a security clearance. However, most agencies granted an employee whose clearance had been denied or revoked the right to be informed of the basis for denial or revocation, the right to make a response, and the right to a written decision on the clearance. Many agencies also provided for a written appeal to a higher authority within the agency. In August 1995, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12968. The Order provides a firmer basis for due process consideration of decisions to withhold or revoke clearances of applicants and employees in the federal government. The 1995 Executive Order, a significant advance for federal employees whose positions are linked to clearances, is reprinted below:</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">EXECUTIVE ORDER</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">PART 2--ACCESS ELIGIBILITY POLICY AND PROCEDURE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Eligibility Determinations.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Determinations of eligibility for access to classified information shall be based on criteria established under this order. Such determinations are separate from suitability determinations with respect to the hiring or retention of persons for employment by the government or any other personnel actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The number of employees that each agency determines are eligible for access to classified information shall be kept to the minimum required for the conduct of agency functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Eligibility for access to classified information shall not be requested or granted solely to permit entry to, or ease of movement within, controlled areas when the employee has no need for access and access to classified information may reasonably be prevented. Where circumstances indicate employees may be inadvertently exposed to classified information in the course of their duties, agencies are authorized to grant or deny, in their discretion, facility access approvals to such employees based on an appropriate level of investigation as determined by each agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Except in agencies where eligibility for access is a mandatory condition of employment, eligibility for access to classified information shall only be requested or granted based on a demonstrated, foreseeable need for access. Requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements is prohibited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Eligibility for access to classified information may be granted where there is a temporary need for access, such as one-time participation in a classified project, provided the investigative standards established under this order have been satisfied. In such cases, a fixed date or event for expiration shall be identified and access to classified information shall be limited to information related to the particular project or assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Level of Access Approval.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The level at which an access approval is granted for an employee shall be limited, and relate directly, to the level of classified information for which there is a need for access. Eligibility for access to a higher level of classified information includes eligibility for access to information classified at a lower level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Access to classified information relating to a special access program shall be granted in accordance with procedures established by the head of the agency that created the program or, for programs pertaining to intelligence activities (including special activities but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs) or intelligence sources and methods, by the Director of Central Intelligence. To the extent possible and consistent with the national security interests of the United States, such procedures shall be consistent with the standards and procedures established by and under this order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.3&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Temporary Access to Higher Levels.</span> (a) An employee who has been determined to be eligible for access to classified information based on favorable adjudication of a completed investigation may be granted temporary access to a higher level where security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations find that such access:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;is necessary to meet operational or contractual exigencies not expected to be of a recurring nature;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;will not exceed 180 days; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;is limited to specific, identifiable information that is made the subject of a written access record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Where the access granted under subsection (a) of this section involves another agency's classified information, that agency must concur before access to its information is granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reciprocal Acceptance of Access Eligibility Determinations.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except when an agency has substantial information indicating that an employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, background investigations and eligibility determinations conducted under this order shall be mutually and reciprocally accepted by all agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Except where there is substantial information indicating that the employee may not satisfy the standards in section 3.1 of this order, an employee with existing access to a special access program shall not be denied eligibility for access to another special access program at the same sensitivity level as determined personally by the agency head or deputy agency head, or have an existing access eligibility readjudicated, so long as the employee has a need for access to the information involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;This section shall not preclude agency heads from establishing additional, but not duplicative, investigative or adjudicative procedures for a special access program or for candidates for detail or assignment to their agencies, where such procedures are required in exceptional circumstances to protect the national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Where temporary eligibility for access is granted under sections 2.3 or 3.3 of this order or where the determination of eligibility for access is conditional, the fact of such temporary or conditional access shall be conveyed to any other agency that considers affording the employee access to its information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Specific Access Requirement.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Employees who have been determined to be eligible for access to classified information shall be given access to classified information only where there is a need-to-know that information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;It is the responsibility of employees who are authorized holders of classified information to verify that a prospective recipient's eligibility for access has been granted by an authorized agency official and to ensure that a need-to-know exists prior to allowing such access, and to challenge requests for access that do not appear well-founded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2.6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Access by Non-United States Citizens</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Where there are compelling reasons in furtherance of an agency mission, immigrant alien and foreign national employees who possess a special expertise may, in the discretion of the agency, be granted limited access to classified information only for specific programs, projects, contracts, licenses, certificates, or grants for which there is a need for access. Such individuals shall not be eligible for access to any greater level of classified information than the United States Government has determined may be releasable to the country of which the subject is currently a citizen, and such limited access may be approved only if the prior 10 years of the subject's life can be appropriately investigated. If there are any doubts concerning granting access, additional lawful investigative procedures shall be fully pursued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Exceptions to these requirements may be permitted only by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 6.1 of this order to further substantial national security interests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">PART 3--ACCESS ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 3.1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standards.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;No employee shall be deemed to be eligible for access to classified information merely by reason of Federal service or contracting, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee status, or as a matter of right or privilege, or as a result of any particular title, rank, position, or affiliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Except as provided in sections 2.6 and 3.3 of this order, eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only to employees who are United States citizens for whom an appropriate investigation has been completed and whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information. A determination of eligibility for access to such information is a discretionary security decision based on judgments by appropriately trained adjudicative personnel. Eligibility shall be granted only where facts and circumstances indicate access to classified information is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of the national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The United States Government does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or sexual orientation in granting access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;In determining eligibility for access under this order, agencies may investigate and consider any matter that relates to the determination of whether access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. <span id="Page_2535"></span>No inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;No negative inference concerning the standards in this section may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. Such counseling can be a positive factor in eligibility determinations. However, mental health counseling, where relevant to the adjudication of access to classified information, may justify further inquiry to determine whether the standards of subsection (b) of this section are satisfied, and mental health may be considered where it directly relates to those standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, including access to special access programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 3.2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Basis for Eligibility Approval.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Eligibility determinations for access to classified information shall be based on information concerning the applicant or employee that is acquired through the investigation conducted pursuant to this order or otherwise available to security officials and shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record. Applicants or employees shall be required to provide relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in investigating and adjudicating their eligibility for access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of investigative standards for background investigations for access to classified information. These standards may vary for the various levels of access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall prohibit an agency from utilizing any lawful investigative procedure in addition to the investigative requirements set forth in this order and its implementing regulations to resolve issues that may arise during the course of a background investigation or reinvestigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 3.3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Special Circumstances</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;In exceptional circumstances where official functions must be performed prior to the completion of the investigative and adjudication process, temporary eligibility for access to classified information may be granted to an employee while the initial investigation is underway. When such eligibility is granted, the initial investigation shall be expedited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Temporary eligibility for access under this section shall include a justification, and the employee must be notified in writing that further access is expressly conditioned on the favorable completion of the investigation and issuance of an access eligibility approval. Access will be immediately terminated, along with any assignment requiring an access eligibility approval, if such approval is not granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only by security personnel authorized by the agency head to make access eligibility determinations and shall be based on minimum investigative standards developed by the Security Policy Board not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Temporary eligibility for access may be granted only to particular, identified categories of classified information necessary to perform the lawful and authorized functions that are the basis for the granting of temporary access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in subsection (a) shall be construed as altering the authority of an agency head to waive requirements for granting access to classified information pursuant to statutory authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Where access has been terminated under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order and a new need for access arises, access eligibility up to the same level shall be reapproved without further investigation as to employees who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years, provided they have remained employed by the same employer during the period in question, the employee certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the employee for the last background investigation, and there is no information that would tend to indicate the employee may no longer satisfy the standards established by this order for access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Access eligibility shall be reapproved for individuals who were determined to be eligible based on a favorable adjudication of an investigation completed within the prior 5 years and who have been retired or otherwise separated from United States Government employment for not more than 2 years; provided there is no indication the individual may no longer satisfy the standards of this order, the individual certifies in writing that there has been no change in the relevant information provided by the individual for the last background investigation, and an appropriate record check reveals no unfavorable information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 3.4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reinvestigation Requirements</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Because circumstances and characteristics may change dramatically over time and thereby alter the eligibility of employees for continued access to classified information, reinvestigations shall be conducted with the same priority and care as initial investigations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Employees who are eligible for access to classified information shall be the subject of periodic reinvestigations and may also be reinvestigated if, at any time, there is reason to believe that they may no longer meet the standards for access established in this order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Not later than 180 days after the effective date of this order, the Security Policy Board shall develop a common set of reinvestigative standards, including the frequency of reinvestigations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">PART 4--INVESTIGATIONS FOR FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. Agencies that conduct background investigations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of State, are authorized to conduct personnel security investigations in the United States when requested by a foreign government as part of its own personnel security program and with the consent of the individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">PART 5--REVIEW OF ACCESS DETERMINATIONS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 5.1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Determinations of Need for Access.</span> A determination under section 2.1(b)(4) of this order that an employee does not have, or no longer has, a need for access is a discretionary determination and shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 5.2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Review Proceedings for Denials or Revocations of Eligibility for Access</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Applicants and employees who are determined to not meet the standards for access to classified information established in section 3.1 of this order shall be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;provided as comprehensive and detailed a written explanation of the basis for that conclusion as the national security interests of the United States and other applicable law permit;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;provided within 30 days, upon request and to the extent the documents would be provided if requested under the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 552) or the Privacy Act (3 USC 552a), as applicable, any documents, records, and reports upon which a denial or revocation is based;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;informed of their right to be represented by counsel or other representative at their own expense; to request any documents, records, and reports as described in section 5.2(a)(2) upon which a denial or revocation is based; and to request the entire investigative file, as permitted by the national security and other applicable law, which, if requested, shall be promptly provided prior to the time set for a written reply;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;provided a reasonable opportunity to reply in writing to, and to request a review of, the determination;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;provided an opportunity to appeal in writing to a high level panel, appointed by the agency head, which shall be comprised of at least three members, two of whom shall be selected from outside the security field. Decisions of the panel shall be in writing, and final except as provided in subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;provided an opportunity to appear personally and to present relevant documents, materials, and information at some point in the process before an adjudicative or other authority, other than the investigating entity, as determined by the agency head. A written summary or recording of such appearance shall be made part of the applicant's or employee's security record, unless such appearance occurs in the presence of the appeals panel described in subsection (a)(6) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall prohibit an agency head from personally exercising the appeal authority in subsection (a)(6) of this section based upon recommendations from an appeals panel. In such case, the decision of the agency head shall be final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Agency heads shall promulgate regulations to implement this section and, at their sole discretion and as resources and national security considerations permit, may provide additional review proceedings beyond those required by subsection (a) of this section. This section does not require additional proceedings, however, and creates no procedural or substantive rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;When the head of an agency or principal deputy personally certifies that a procedure set forth in this section cannot be made available in a particular case without damaging the national security interests of the United States by revealing classified information, the particular procedure shall not be made available. This certification shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head pursuant to any law or other Executive <span id="Page_2536"></span>order to deny or terminate access to classified information in the interests of national security. The power and responsibility to deny or terminate access to classified information pursuant to any law or other Executive order may be exercised only where the agency head determines that the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section cannot be invoked in a manner that is consistent with national security. This determination shall be conclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1)&#x2003;This section shall not be deemed to limit or affect the responsibility and power of an agency head to make determinations of suitability for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall require that an agency provide the procedures prescribed in subsection (a) of this section to an applicant where a conditional offer of employment is withdrawn for reasons of suitability or any other reason other than denial of eligibility for access to classified information.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Executive Order 12968 does not apply to an individual whose access to information was denied before the effective date of the Order, even though the denial continued beyond the effective date. <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3060). A probationary employee whose clearance is denied is not entitled to a Board hearing for a preexisting condition. The denial of the clearance, even if it relates to conditions extant prior to the appointment, constitutes a postappointment reason. <span class="Italic">Von Deneen v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 33 MSPR 420, 423 &#x0026; n.3 (1987). Probationary employees appear, however, to fall within the definition of "employee" under Executive Order 12968. For discussion of some aspects of the clearance process for civilian employees of the Defense Department, refer to <span class="Italic">Romero v. DOD</span>, 658 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2011). [Refer to <a href="0100-2023-08-001.html#sec1-1">Chapter 1</a> for probationary employees' limited appeal rights.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before Executive Order 12968, if the agency decided to base an adverse action on the loss or denial of a security clearance, it proceeded under 5 USC 7513 in the same manner that it did with any other misconduct case: on the basis that the action promoted service efficiency. When the action against the employee was proposed, the employee was given notice of the reasons for the revocation of his clearance if that information was not provided in the earlier access determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mantos v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 117, 120 (1994). Once the employee was given the reasons for clearance revocation, the agency then had to allow the employee an opportunity to respond to the specific charges, with the assistance of counsel, and to offer evidence of any mitigating factors relevant to granting or continuing the clearance. The employee was entitled to a written decision on the revocation or denial of a security clearance. Many agencies allowed the employee the right to appeal to a higher authority in the agency prior to a final decision on revocation of the clearance. [Chapter 6 covers the use of indefinite suspensions pending suspensions of clearances during "<a href="0100-2023-13-119.html#sec6-118">Security Clearance or Other Investigation</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because the decision to grant a security clearance is an "overall commonsense determination" to be considered in light of all available evidence, an agency is not bound by legal precedent in making its decision. Nonetheless, legal precedent can be persuasive. Federal court decisions provide some guidance concerning specific charges. In addition, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA, successor to the Directorate for Industrial Security Clearance Review), in the Department of Defense <a href="https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/">https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/</a>, maintains decisions made by hearing examiners in that office on security clearances granted or denied to contractor employees in the defense industry who require access to classified information. DOHA uses the same criteria as federal agencies in determining whether to grant clearances. Although the decisions of DOHA are binding on the Department of Defense, they are not binding on other federal agencies; but they may be useful because of their similarity. The decisions are kept in binders in chronological order. The indexing of the cases is not extensive but is generally kept up-to-date. DOHA issues an annual index supplemented by an index prepared by the Chairman of the Board. Some DOHA decisions in private sector cases are at the DOHA website, <a href="https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/Industrial-Security-Program/Industrial-Security-Clearance-Decisions/">https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/Industrial-Security-Program/Industrial-Security-Clearance-Decisions/</a>. Information on DOHA cases and procedures can be obtained by <span id="Page_2537"></span>calling their office at 1-866-231-3153 and checking their website, <a href="https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/">https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/</a>. Requests for information can be sent to DOHA at P.O. Box 3656, Arlington, Virginia 22203. [Refer to Elaine L.
