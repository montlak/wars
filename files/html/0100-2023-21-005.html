<h3 class="h3" id="sec14-5"><span class="space">B.</span> FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">To be eligible for a federal retirement or to create an annuity interest for another individual, for example, a spouse or child, one must have held a federal appointment; then, one must also have service credit, a topic subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wenk v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 218, 221-23 (1984), outlined the elements of a federal appointment for analysis of service credit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are three cumulative elements to the statutory definition of "employee": appointment by an authorized federal employee or officer, performance of a federal function, and supervision by a federal employee or officer. Although there is no dispute that appellant was subject to military supervision, there is substantial disagreement concerning whether appellant has satisfied the remaining two elements of the definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Appointment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that specific documentation such as a SF-52 or SF-50 is not dispositive in determining whether an appointment has been effected. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy,</span> 7 MSPB 741 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends, however, that some type of formal "appointive document" is necessary and that <span class="Italic">Costner, supra,</span> [<span class="Italic">Costner v. United States,</span> 665 F.2d 1016 (Ct. Cl. 1981)] precludes the use of a "totality of circumstances" approach to establish an appointment. We disagree. The court in <span class="Italic">Costner</span> merely stated that in determining whether all three elements were present, "[a]n abundance of federal function and supervision will not make up for the lack of an appointment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1020. This holding does not preclude using the totality of circumstances to prove the existence of one of the three elements particularly when, as here, direct evidence of appointment is unavailable due to factors beyond the appellant's control. The Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Goutos v. United States,</span> 552 F.2d 922, 924 n.3 (Ct. Cl. 1976), specifically recognized the possibility that oral evidence of intent to appoint might be relevant when a record of appointment is lost. In <span class="Italic">Costner,</span> the court expressed no intention to overrule that holding; nor can such intention be implied from that decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has conceded that no appointment document has been located. Ralph W. Powers, commander of all CIC forces in Austria until December 1945, and Merrill Kelly, Special Assistant to the Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, testified that general procedures for handling contingency expenditures and a concern for security resulted in periodic destruction of records relating to those expenditures. Despite the absence of formal documents, appellant has presented ample, corroborated evidence, through affidavits and direct testimony, to show that his employers intended to appoint him as a civilian in the service of the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant argued that Congress appropriated contingency funds to the military from 1945 to 1951 to be spent for a broad range of needs, including the hiring of civilian employees. Mr. Powers testified that a directive from General Eisenhower establishing the CIC allowed for expenditure of contingency funds, and that such funds were routinely used to pay civilian nationals working for the CIC. Mr. Kelly presented testimony corroborating Mr. Powers' statement that CIC detachments had authority to hire and pay civilian employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">John B. Burkel, appellant's supervisor during the time in question, testified that he knew appellant, that appellant was a member of the "in-house staff," privy to classified information, and that appellant reported to work on a daily basis for six years. Henry Fuchs, a co-worker at the time, presented an affidavit identifying the positions held by appellant, including Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) of the Visa Section and SAIC of the General Investigation Branch. Although the agency contends that appellant was an "indirect hire," employed by the Austrian government yet working for the U.S. military, Mr. Burkel, Mr. Powers, and Mr. Kelly testified to the contrary. Moreover, James V. Milano, the Chief of Operations in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence for U.S. Forces in Austria, specifically stated that "Mr. Wenk was hired directly by the U.S. Army" and James K. McGregor, Supervisory Personnel Management Specialist with the Department of the Army, testified that the Department of the Army does not "refute appellant's claim of having an appointment" although the absence of records prevents confirmation of appellant's employment status or duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the foregoing testimony sufficient to support appellant's claim that he was "appointed" as an employee of the civil service from July 1, 1945 through April 30, 1951. Although the records may have been destroyed, appellant has presented ample corroborated evidence of intent to effect an appointment on the part of officials authorized to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Federal Function</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that no federal function was performed by appellant, stating that appellant "was engaged in the type of internal security police functions which would, in other times and in other circumstances, have been performed by Austrian national police forces." The agency's argument is not persuasive. Clearly the role and responsibilities of an occupying U.S. force constitute a federal function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was paid from contingency funds, appropriated by Congress for use by the Secretary of War, to carry out sensitive, classified activities by intelligence and counter-intelligence elements of the U.S. Army. Based on these facts, we find that appellant was engaged in a federal function during the period of his employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, therefore, that appellant has satisfied the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). Between July, 1945 and April, 1951 appellant worked for the CIC as a member of the in-house staff, having accepted an offer of employment from persons acting in their official capacity with authority to appoint individuals in the service of the U.S. Government. In the performance of his tasks appellant was supervised and directed by federal officers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, OPM's petition for review is hereby DENIED for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, and OPM is hereby ORDERED to grant appellant service credit for the period from July 1, 1945 through April 30, 1951. Proof of compliance with this Order shall be submitted by the agency to the Office of the Secretary of the Board within twenty (20) days of the date of this Order. In the event of agency noncompliance, a petition for enforcement may be filed with the Washington Regional Office pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.181(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In appeals from OPM reconsideration decisions involving Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA) retirement benefits, the appellant has the burden of proving entitlement to benefits by preponderant evidence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] . Two types of federal service are pertinent to a determination of whether an individual is eligible for a retirement annuity under the CSRA, "creditable service" and "covered service." <span class="Italic">Noveloso v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 321, 323 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 925 F.2d 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). While almost all federal service is creditable service, covered service is more limited in scope, referring to employees who are subject to the CSRA, i.e., employees who must deposit part of their basic pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, to be eligible for a civil service annuity, an applicant must demonstrate that he has completed at least 5 years of creditable civilian service, and that he has served at least 1 of his last 2 years of federal service in a position covered under the CSRA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a), (b); <span class="Italic">Quiocson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 490 F.3d 1358, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(c), an individual generally may make a deposit into the Fund if he is currently an "employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(c); <span class="Italic">Floresca v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 93, 98 (1995). The term "employee," as it is used for the purposes of the statutory chapter governing CSRS, is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(1), and it refers to individuals who are serving in positions covered by CSRS. <span class="Italic">See Vanaman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 598, 601 (1993) (covered service refers only to those federal employees who are subject to the CSRA and must deposit a portion of their pay into the Fund); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(a)(1) (requiring the employing agency to deduct retirement contributions from the pay of an "employee"). Here, there is no indication that the appellant was ever employed in any capacity that would cause him to be an "employee." (Standard Form 50 indicating that the appellant's retirement plan was "Other"). Instead, the record shows that the appellant performed service that was excluded from coverage under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(b)(1)(i) (excluding from coverage alien workers at duty stations in a foreign country under circumstances where U.S. citizens may be covered).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a)(2), OPM has interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(c) to permit an individual who is no longer employed by the federal government to make a deposit if he "retains civil service retirement annuity rights based on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld...in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund," and if his "annuity has not been finally adjudicated." In other words, an individual who has been separated from a CSRS-covered position (i.e., one in which he was subject to CSRS retirement contributions), who is eligible for a CSRS annuity, and whose annuity has not been "finally adjudicated" may make a deposit. However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit specifically has found that an individual may not make a deposit under section 8334 if he was not separated from a CSRS-covered position and a retroactive deposit does not convert a non-covered position to a covered position. <span class="Italic">Quiocson,</span> 490 F.3d at 1360. Here, the appellant does not allege that he was in a position in which he was subject to CSRS retirement contributions. It therefore appears, based on the undisputed facts, that the appellant is not entitled to make a deposit under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112(a)(2).</p>

The appellant's reliance on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.303(a) is misplaced, as that section only addresses whether service is creditable, not whether it is covered. <span class="Italic">See Lledo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 886 F.3d 1211, 1214 (Fed.

Further, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334(c), which permits certain individuals to make deposits, does not support the appellant's claims. Section 8334(c) applies only to individuals who, unlike the appellant, have covered service, in other words, service during which contributions to the Fund were withheld. <span class="Italic">Muyco v.

The appellant does not satisfy the definition of 'employee' in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.112, which sets forth those eligible to make a deposit to the Fund under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8334. <span class="Italic">See Dela Rosa v.

The position urged by Watts would create a new category of employees who, without formal appointment or even awareness of the government's role when employed, would become 'appointed' civil servants, in numbers unknown, and without thought as to their effect on actuarial soundness of the retirement fund.

<p class="Body-Text">An individual may have more than one period of federal service.

OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 247, 248-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-3, 5-8, 10-11 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed by the federal government from May 11, 1959, through January 23, 1982, with some breaks in service during this time. On October 10, 1984, she was reinstated through a career appointment, and on September 29, 1985, she resigned. On December 15, 1998, she applied for a deferred annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although OPM found the appellant entitled to a CSRS annuity, it also found that it could not include, in its computation of the amount of the annuity, the appellant's service from October 1984 until September 1985. It subsequently issued a reconsideration decision reaffirming its position regarding the computation of the appellant's annuity, and the appellant filed an appeal with the Board's Dallas Field Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge noted that OPM's conclusion that the appellant's service in 1984 and 1985 could not be credited toward the appellant's annuity was based on the following provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee...must complete, within the last 2 years before any separation from service,...at least 1 year of creditable civilian service during which he is subject to [subchapter III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 83] before he...[is] eligible for annuity under this subchapter based on the separation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He also noted that the service to which this provision referred--i.e., service during which the appellant was subject to subchapter III of chapter 83--was known as "covered service," and he indicated that "the one-year-out-of-the last-two rule [was] only applicable to the question of whether an employee ha[d] sufficient <span id="Page_4078"></span>'covered' service to be entitled to an annuity at all...." He indicated further that the rule was designed to prevent employees from receiving CSRS annuities based on years of noncovered service, for which they had made no CSRS contributions, by obtaining assignment to covered positions just before their retirement. In addition, he noted that almost all the appellant's service, unlike that of the employees Congress intended to exclude through this rule, was covered; that OPM did not deny that the appellant was entitled to a deferred annuity; and that "the only test for whether [the appellant's service from 1984 to 1985 would] be included in determining her annuity amount [was] whether it [was] creditable service." Because he could find nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332--the statutory section defining creditable service--that would exclude the appellant's last period of service, he found that the appellant's service during that period should be credited toward the deferred annuity to which she was entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in the administrative judge's view that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) applies only to the issue of whether a person "has sufficient 'covered' service to be entitled to an annuity at all,"<span class="Italic">id.</span> at 5. As the language quoted above indicates, that provision concerns the issue of whether a person is entitled to an annuity based on a particular separation from service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b). A person who is separated from the federal service on more than one occasion may be entitled to an annuity on the basis of one of those separation but not another. <span class="Italic">See Hawco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 290, 293-95 (1992) (Board's finding that appellant was not entitled to annuity based on his most recent separation did not preclude finding that he was entitled to annuity based on earlier separation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case now before us presents such a situation. The appellant in this case was separated on more than one occasion; and, while OPM evidently agrees that the appellant had the required 1 year of covered service during the 2 years prior to her 1982 separation, the appellant does not deny that she had less than 1 year of covered service during the 2 years prior to her 1985 separation. According to the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b), therefore, the 1985 separation does not entitle her to an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge indicated, the primary intent of Congress in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) seems to have been to prevent employees whose service was largely excluded from CSRS coverage, and who therefore contributed little to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, from obtaining annuities computed as though the employees had made such contributions. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 83-2230, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3562, 3562-63. As he indicated further, the appellant in this case does not fall within this category of employees. The legislative history on which the administrative judge relied, however, shows that Congress was aware, when it enacted the provision, that the provision's effects would extend beyond employees such as those described above. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> 1954 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3562, 3564-65. For example, it was aware that the provision would prevent persons who were receiving annuities that were reduced based on their age at retirement from having the annuity reductions eliminated on the basis of brief subsequent appointments. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The fact that most of the appellant's service is covered therefore does not show that application of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) to her case would be contrary to the intent of the legislation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b) is unambiguous and therefore must be given effect. Accordingly, we find that, although the appellant has been found to be entitled to an annuity based on her 1982 separation, she is not entitled to an annuity based on her 1985 separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, under the statutory section addressing the creditability of service toward a CSRS annuity, service is to be credited only "from the date of original employment to the date of separation on which title to annuity is based...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(b). Because the appellant has been found to be entitled to an annuity on the basis of her 1982 separation, rather than on the basis of her 1985 separation, her service from October 1984 to September 1985 is not creditable toward her annuity.</p>
