<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-232"><span class="space">b.</span> FLSA Exemption Status</h5>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators may make FLSA exemption determinations when they review grievances seeking overtime pay or seeking findings that positions are nonexempt. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1478-81 (1998) (professional exemption classification for GG-11 level examiners); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA 483, 494 (1994) (<span class="Italic">SSA III</span>) (arbitrator properly applied OPM and Labor Department regulations to determine exemption status); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 44 FLRA 773, 792-99 (1992) (affirming arbitrators' authority to interpret, apply OPM FLSA regulations). A grievance concerning FLSA exemption status is not barred as a matter involving classification, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Nat'l Training Ctr. and AFGE Local 2035</span>, 71 FLRA 522, 522-24 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting concerning grant of interlocutory review):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we clarify that a grievance seeking to change employees' exemption status under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not raise a classification issue barred from negotiated grievance procedures under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance on behalf of "all bargaining[-]unit employees" at the Agency's Fort Irwin National Training Center in California. As relevant here, the grievance alleges that the Agency violated the FLSA and the parties' collective-bargaining agreement because the Agency "[f]ailed to properly designate employees as FLSA non[-]exempt" and "pay proper compensation for overtime." Among other requirements, the FLSA obligates employers to compensate non-exempt employees for work in excess of forty hours per week at a rate of one and one-half times the employees' regular wages.[3] Under the FLSA, an "agency must review and make a determination on each employee's exemption status."[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.201.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The grievance does not involve a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Union's grievance is barred as a matter of law, and by the parties' agreement, because it involves classification under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute. The Agency argues that the Union's grievance concerns classification because it seeks the "redesignation of all exempt employees as non-exempt" under the FLSA and redesignation "involves an analysis and inquiry concerning the appropriate grade level of all of the positions held by the" grievants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), arbitrators lack jurisdiction to determine "the classification of any position [that] does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee."[27] The Authority has interpreted "classification" as "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by [the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)] under chapter 51 of title 5, United States Code."[28]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5); <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 70 FLRA at 730-31.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 70 FLRA at 729-30.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not demonstrate that the Union's grievance, requesting that employees be redesignated as "non-exempt" under the FLSA, <span id="page_2113"></span>involves "the analysis and identification of a position and placing it in a class under the position-classification plan established by" OPM.[29] An agency's FLSA "determination on each employee's exemption status"[30] for purposes of overtime compensation is separate from an agency's classification of a position.[31] Moreover, as the Agency itself acknowledges, federal courts have long held that FLSA overtime claims of unionized employees are within the scope of grievable matters under the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[31]&#x2003;Consistent with this distinction, the Authority has routinely resolved the merits of exceptions to arbitration awards in which the underlying grievance alleged that the agency improperly exempted employees from overtime pay under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 70 FLRA 873 (2018); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian Head, Md</span>., 56 FLRA 280 (2000); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt. Md</span>., 44 FLRA 773 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we reject the Agency's claim that the grievance involves a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA carefully examines FLSA exemption status of employees. If an arbitrator errs in his exemption status determination, or if the record is unclear concerning exemption status, the award will be set aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 32 FLRA 638, 639-41 (1988). <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons FCC Victorville and AFGE Local 3969</span>, 65 FLRA 539, 541 (2011), considered a claimed exemption for teaching personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the OPM regulations implementing the FLSA, "[e]ach employee is presumed to be FLSA nonexempt unless the employing agency correctly determines that the employee clearly meets the requirements of one or more of the exemptions[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(a). In addition, "[e]xemption criteria must be narrowly construed to apply only to those employees who are clearly within the terms and spirit of the exemption." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(b). Accordingly, "[t]he burden of proof rests with the agency that asserts the exemption[,]" and "[i]f there is a reasonable doubt as to whether an employee meets the criteria for exemption, the employee will be designated FLSA nonexempt." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(c), (d).</p>
<p class="noindent">Subject to FLRA scrutiny, however, arbitrators are free to assess the weight of the evidence of exemption status if they properly allocate the burdens of proof, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr., Crane Div. and AFGE Local 1415</span>, 49 FLRA 27, 30 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">AFGE v. OPM</span>, the court concluded that the FLSA provided that employees were presumed eligible for overtime and that agencies bore the burden of showing that employees were exempt from FLSA coverage. 821 F.2d at 770-71. Here, the Arbitrator noted that <span class="Italic">AFGE v. OPM</span> and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202 placed the burden of proof on the Agency. The Arbitrator found that the "Agency's documentary and testimonial evidence...confirmed the correctness of the exempt status of the 15 [g]rievants concerning whom the Union presented no evidence."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union's reliance on the Arbitrator's statement that the Union presented no evidence is misplaced. In our view, the Arbitrator's statement reflects only a factual finding that the Union did not present any rebuttal evidence concerning 15 grievants and does not establish that the burden of proof was placed on the Union. It is clear from the award as a whole that the Arbitrator evaluated the evidence submitted by the Agency and concluded that the Agency sustained its burden of proving that 15 of the disputed employees were exempt from the FLSA. We conclude that the Union's exception constitutes nothing more than disagreement with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his reasoning and conclusions and as such, provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may apply both OPM and DOL regulations to determine exemption status, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 356, 359 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator should have relied solely on OPM regulations in order to determine whether the Auditors are FLSA exempt and that the Arbitrator's statement--that the DOL regulations govern if a conflict exists between DOL and OPM regulations--is an incorrect statement of the law. Moreover, the Agency claims that, even assuming the Arbitrator properly relied on DOL regulations in determining whether the Auditors were FLSA exempt, the DOL regulations that the Arbitrator cited in his award are obsolete.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception fails to establish that the award is deficient. Under Authority precedent, it is well established that an arbitrator may consider both OPM and DOL regulations when reviewing an employee's FLSA exemption status. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1479-80 (1998) (applying both DOL and OPM regulations in order to determine whether the award exempting GG-11 level examiners from the FLSA was contrary to law). Moreover, the Authority has found that, although OPM regulations presumptively control, the DOL regulations are useful to arbitrators when interpreting the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 1063, 1072 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Adam v. United States</span>, 26 Cl. Ct. 782, 786 (1992) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Wash. D.C.</span>) (finding that, "in construing [the OPM] regulations, the court is not barred, but[,] rather[,] encouraged to consider the DOL's regulations and other interpretations of the statute"). Here, although the Arbitrator improperly stated that DOL regulations control in the event of a conflict between the DOL regulations and the OPM regulations, the award is not deficient because the Arbitrator did not disregard the OPM regulations when making his determination that the Auditors are not FLSA exempt. Opinion and Interim Award at 36; <span class="Italic">see IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA at 1072 (requiring arbitrators to consider OPM regulations when reviewing the FLSA exemption status of a federal employee). The Arbitrator discussed both the professional and administrative exemptions under the OPM and DOL regulations. Indeed, the Arbitrator cited almost exclusively to OPM regulations when he analyzed whether the professional and administrative exemption tests were met. Thus, the Arbitrator's reliance on both DOL and OPM regulations does not render the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">DHS, supra,</span> FLRA sustained the arbitrator's application of exemption standards for administrative and professional personnel to auditors (finding them FLSA nonexempt), 65 FLRA at 360-62:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator wrongfully found that the Auditors lacked discretion and independent judgment.&#x2003;The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator should have applied certain OPM regulations demonstrating that "employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level." (Citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.104). Also, the Agency claims that the Arbitrator should have relied upon certain DOL regulations stating that "'[t]he use of manuals, guidelines or other established procedures containing or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial, or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption....'" (Quoting 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541.704). Finally, the Agency asserts that, instead of only comparing the Auditors with inspectors, the Arbitrator should have taken into account the similarities between the Auditors and accountants who are FLSA exempt.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under OPM's implementing regulations, "[t]he designation of an employee as FLSA exempt or nonexempt ultimately rests on the duties actually performed by the employee." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Tech. Div.</span>, <span class="Italic">Indian Head, Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 280, 286 (2001) (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(h)(i)) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy Indian Head II</span>). Moreover, it is the employer's burden to prove that employees are exempt. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Corning Glass Works v. Brennan</span>, 417 U.S. 188, 196-97 (1974)). Exemptions are construed narrowly against the employer who seeks to assert the exemptions. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">Arnold v. Ben Kanowsky, Inc.</span>, 361 U.S. 388, 392 (1960)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Agency asserts, and the Union concedes, that the Arbitrator improperly relied on the new version of the OPM regulations. We find that the Arbitrator erred by applying the new OPM regulations in his award because the grievance was presented and the Agency's decision to classify the Auditors as FLSA exempt occurred in 2006. The new OPM regulations became effective on October 17, 2007, and amendments to these regulations included changes to the administrative and professional exemptions. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.206, 551.208. For instance, new requirements were added to the professional exemption's primary duty test, and the 80-percent test was eliminated from both the administrative and professional exemptions. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>However, there is no indication that the amendments were intended to be applied retroactively; in fact, OPM noted in its summary of the new OPM regulations that "[t]he regulations...[have] no retroactive effects[.]" 72 Fed. Reg. 52,753, 52,761 (Sept. 17, 2007); <span class="Italic">see U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Mines, Pittsburgh Research Ctr.</span>, 53 FLRA 34, 38 n.1 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Mines</span>) (determining that the Authority should apply the pre-amended version of the Training Act in existence at the time of the events giving rise to the grievance because there was no indication in the legislative history of the amendments that they were intended to be applied retroactively). Consequently, in reviewing the Agency's remaining exceptions, we apply the 2006 version of the OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Mines</span>, 53 FLRA at 38 n.1 (applying the pre-amended version of the statute in order to determine whether the award was contrary to law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the 2006 version of the OPM regulations, an employee is considered FLSA exempt under the professional exemption if the agency can establish that the primary duty, intellectual and varied work, discretion and independent judgment, and 80-percent tests are met. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.207. An employee is exempted from the FLSA under the administrative exemption if the agency can establish that the primary duty, nonmanual work, discretion and independent judgment, and 80-percent tests are met. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206; <span class="Italic">see Marine Operations Ctr.</span>, 57 FLRA at 434 (determining that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206, an employee must meet all of the criteria to be exempted from FLSA overtime based on the administrative exemption). As noted by the parties, the discretion and independent judgment test is the same under both exemptions. In order <span id="page_2114"></span>to meet the test, an "employee [must] frequently [exercise] discretion and independent judgment, under only general 65 FLRA No. 73 Decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Authority 361 supervision, in performing the normal day-to-day work." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.206(c), 551.207(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, his legal conclusion that the Auditors do not exercise discretion and independent judgment is not contrary to law. In his award, the Arbitrator evaluated the credibility of the evidence and testimony presented to him and considered the duties actually performed by the Auditors before concluding that the Auditors lack discretion and independent judgment. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy Indian Head II</span>, 57 FLRA at 286 (indicating that an arbitrator must consider the duties actually performed by the grievant in determining whether that grievant is FLSA exempt). The Arbitrator found that, because the Auditors rely heavily on the FA Program policy, the RAD Manual, and GAGAS requirements, they lack sufficient discretion and independent judgment. <span class="Italic">See U.S. DHS, Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 61 FLRA 485, 493 (2006) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>) (finding that it is not sufficient that employees exercise some discretion in the performance of their duties in order for them to qualify as professional employees). According to the Arbitrator, testimony demonstrated that the Auditors consider the FA Program policy and the RAD manual to be the "Bible" of their work and that "the purpose of the FA Program policy and the RAD Manual is to create uniform procedures for the conduct of the audits and to minimize the exercise of discretion by individual auditors." <span class="Italic">See DHS</span>, 61 FLRA at 493 (determining that, although there were many decisions that Agricultural Specialists had to make in applying the manuals and performing their work, it was clear that the determinations that required judgment and extensive educational background, the hallmark of professional employees, were made by employees other than the Agriculture Specialist).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency cites certain DOL regulations suggesting that employees may exercise discretion and independent judgment even if they rely upon manuals and guidelines in performing their duties, those regulations also state that "exemptions are not available...for employees who simply apply well-established techniques or procedures described in manuals or other sources within closely prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances." [6] 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541.704. Moreover, in concluding that the Auditors do not exercise sufficient discretion and independent judgment, the Arbitrator not only took into account the Auditors' reliance on the FA Program Policy, the RAD manual, and GAGAS requirements, but also considered other relevant factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541.704 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">The use of manuals, guidelines or other established procedures containing or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the Act or the regulations in this part. Such manuals and procedures provide guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such reference material would not affect an employee's exempt status. The section 13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, however, for employees who simply apply well-established techniques or procedures described in manuals or other sources within closely prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For instance, the Arbitrator determined that the Auditors do not exercise discretion and independent judgment because their work is subject to extensive supervisory review and heavily edited by management officials. Although the Agency implies that, under the award, an employee cannot be subject to any supervisory review in order for the discretion and independent judgment to be met, the Arbitrator simply found that, in this case, the Auditors' work is subject to considerable supervisory review. Finally, the Arbitrator compared the duties of the Auditors with those of ordinary investigators and determined that, like investigators, the Auditors lack discretion and independent judgment.[7] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 362 Decisions of the Federal Labor Relations Authority 65 FLRA No. 73 280, 285 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Piscione v. Ernst &#x0026; Young, L.L.P.</span>, 171 F.3d 527 (7th Cir. 1999)) (finding that an arbitrator's determination regarding whether an employee's duties satisfy the requirements of an exemption may be based on a comparison of the employee's duties at issue with the duties of other employees whose exempt status has been determined) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Indian Head I</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Although the Agency asserts that the Arbitrator relied solely on the inspector and investigator example contained in the new OPM regulations when he compared the duties of Auditors with those of inspectors, its assertion is without merit. Exceptions at 14 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206(n)). In his award, the Arbitrator also cited an applicable DOL regulation, namely 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 541.203(j), which notes that inspectors and investigators are not FLSA exempt because they do not exercise discretion and independent judgment. Opinion and Interim Award at 43-44. As noted previously, it is well established that an arbitrator may consider DOL regulations when reviewing an employee's FLSA exemption status. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1479-80.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency contends that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator failed to compare the Auditors' duties with those of accountants and failed to credit certain testimony, its contentions are without merit. The Arbitrator's assessment of the weight to be accorded evidence and testimony is a factual finding, to which the Authority must defer in this case as it is not alleged to constitute a nonfact. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 3614</span>, 61 FLRA 719, 723 (2006). Moreover, because the Agency's arguments challenge the Arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and testimony and determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence and testimony, it has not established that the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 4044</span>, 65 FLRA 264, 266 (2010) (finding that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence provides no basis for finding an award deficient); <span class="Italic">SSA, Highland Park, Mich.</span>, 65 FLRA 141, 141 (2010). Consequently, based on the Arbitrator's factual findings, his conclusion--that the Agency failed to demonstrate that the Auditors are FLSA nonexempt because they lack sufficient discretion and independent judgment--is not contrary to law.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;As noted above, under both the professional and administrative exemptions, an employee must meet all of the criteria to be exempted from the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.206, 551.207. Moreover, as also noted above, an employee must exercise discretion and independent judgment under both the professional and administrative exemptions. The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, demonstrate that the Agency has failed to prove that Auditors exercise discretion and independent judgment in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.206 and 551.207. Consequently, it is not necessary to address the Agency's exception with respect to the primary duty test.</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator need not find that a grievant is nonexempt based on the employer's failure to make the exemption determination in a particular manner, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and Dept. of Navy, NAVFAC Washington</span>, 67 FLRA 392, 393-94 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.201 and 551.202 because the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency made an "affirmative determination" that the specialists' positions are FLSA-exempt. However, neither the plain language of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 551.201 and 551.202 nor the case law supports the Union's contention that the Agency "must prove with facts, evidence, documents and testimony that [it] accomplished" what the Union calls "a positive FLSA determination."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM's regulations provide only that an agency must: (1) "review and make a determination on each employee's exemption status";[24] and (2) "designate an employee FLSA[-]exempt when the agency correctly determines that the employee meets the requirements" for exemption provided in the regulations.[25] They make no mention of any process by which an Agency must make a FLSA determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.201.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 551.202(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also claims that <span class="Italic">AFGE v. OPM</span>[26] requires an agency to present evidence that it made an "affirmative determination" of each employee's FLSA-exempt or FLSA-nonexempt status. But the Union mischaracterizes the holding in that case. In <span class="Italic">AFGE v. OPM</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit did not consider whether an employee was properly classified as FLSA-exempt. Rather, the issue before the court was whether an OPM regulation providing that all employees graded General Schedule (GS)-11 and higher were presumed to be FLSA-exempt was inconsistent with the principles of the FLSA. The case has no bearing on whether an agency must present evidence of its internal process with respect to making FLSA determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;821 F.2d 761 (D.C. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency satisfied the requirements of OPM's regulations. Specifically, he made a factual finding that the Agency determined that the specialists' positions were FLSA-exempt. The Union has not established that this finding is deficient as a nonfact. And, after examining the evidence before him, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's determination regarding the specialists' FLSA-exempt status was correct. We therefore find that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the award is contrary to OPM's regulations, and we deny the Union's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Military Sealift Command and AFGE Local 53</span>, 65 FLRA 583, 585-87 (2011), FLRA's focus was on how duties must be examined as to FLSA administrative exemption status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM's regulations, at Subpart B of &#x00A7; 551 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, establish the criteria used to determine an employee's status <span id="page_2115"></span>under the FLSA. However, the designation of an employee as FLSA exempt or non-exempt rests on the duties actually performed by the employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(e). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 280, 284 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Berg v. Newman</span>, 982 F.2d 500 (Fed. Cir. 1992) and other cases) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy</span>). Section 551.202, sets out the following principles governing determinations as to whether an exemption applies to a position: (a) an employee is presumed to be FLSA non-exempt; (b) exemption criteria are to be narrowly construed; (c) the burden of proof rests with the agency that asserts the exemption; and (d) if there is reasonable doubt as to whether an employee meets the exemption criteria, the employee should be designated FLSA non-exempt. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202 (a)-(d) (2005).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator failed to comply with OPM and DOL regulations because his determination was based on position titles and "gross characterizations of duties" instead of on the actual day-to-day duties. However, the Arbitrator specifically recognized that his determination of the exemption status of the ET and EPS positions required consideration of the three criteria set out in the administrative exemption in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206. Thus, he applied the three criteria--the "primary duty" test, the "nonmanual work" test, and the "discretion and independent judgment" test--to the actual duties of the positions. Further, the Arbitrator properly recognized that a position had to meet all criteria of the administrative exemption in order to be FLSA exempt. <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206 (an administrative employee must meet all exemption criteria).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these criteria to the ET position, the Arbitrator considered testimony from both an ET incumbent and a supervisor regarding actual duties, and found their testimony to be consistent. In so doing, he found that the record establishes that the ET's duties do not meet the "primary duty" test in that the position's duties "do not significantly affect the execution of [m]anagement programs or policies and [the incumbent's] duties are fundamentally line, rather than staff, in nature." Regarding the position's inspection duties, the Arbitrator found that these do not meet the "nonmanual work" test because the work "involves the use of skills and technical abilities in gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed procedures, determining what procedure to follow, or determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met." The Arbitrator based his finding on cases, DOL opinions, and OPM Letters describing the duties of electronics technicians as well as on the Agency's failure to produce any evidence that the ET position's duties are distinguishable. As for the "discretion and independent judgment" test, the Arbitrator found that both the record and case precedents establish that the ET position's duties "do not involve the frequent exercise of discretion and independent judgment, but must be accomplished within [Agency] guidelines, regulations, and supervisory review and approval."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the administrative exemption criteria to the EPS position, the Arbitrator considered testimony from the EPS incumbent and a supervisor regarding actual duties, and found their testimony to be consistent. In so doing, he found that the record establishes that inspection duties take up "the overwhelming majority of [the incumbent's] work time" and that this work does not meet any of the tests for the administrative exemption. In addition, the Arbitrator found that the record establishes that the inspections are governed by detailed and comprehensive guidelines and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy</span>, in making FLSA exempt status determinations, "a trial court must have before it sufficient facts concerning the daily activities of the position to justify its legal conclusion." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 56 FLRA at 284 (citation omitted). The Agency has not established that the Arbitrator failed to consider the positions' actual duties. Indeed, it is clear that the Arbitrator based his determinations on the testimony of position incumbents and supervisors regarding actual duties. Accordingly<span class="Italic">, </span>the Authority finds that the award is in compliance with government-wide regulations because the determinations that the ET and EPS positions are exempt were based on evidence of actual duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's contentions that the Arbitrator failed to give appropriate weight to evidence that the ETs' duties are primarily administrative, that ETs represent management, that the work of the EPS is varied and intellectual, that the EPS frequently exercises discretion and independent judgment in performing his work, and that the duties of the EPS are similar to those of the exempt position of safety and occupational health specialist, the Authority will not find the award deficient on the basis of these contentions. The Authority has long held that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and testimony, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence, provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3295</span>, 51 FLRA 27, 32 (1995). Finally, regarding the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator applied the criteria of the administrative exemption from the FLSA too strictly, the Authority finds that a strict application of the exemption is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202, in particular, with the principle in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(b) that exemption criteria must be narrowly construed.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award considering FLSA exemption status was reviewed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW, Local 80</span>, 57 FLRA 430, 433-34 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 551.206 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations establishes the criteria used to determine an employee's status under the FLSA. However, under OPM's regulations implementing the FLSA for Federal employees, the designation of an employee as FLSA exempt or nonexempt ultimately rests on the duties actually performed by the employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(i)<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian</span> <span class="Italic">Head, Md., </span>56 FLRA 280, 284 (2000) <span class="Italic">(citing Berg v. Newman, </span>982 F.2d 500 (Fed. Cir. 1992) and other cases).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator specifically recognized that the grievant's exemption status required the application of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(i) to the three criteria set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206, namely the primary duty test[;] nonmanual work test[;] and discretion and independent judgment test. Applying these criteria to the grievant's actual duties, the Arbitrator found that the grievant spends the major portion of his time on non-exempt work. He found that: (1) the grievant did substantially less coordination in the way of work assignments and decisions about repair or buy than anticipated by his performance plan; (2) the grievant is spending more time in manual work than the type of activity typically associated with exempt status; and (3) in actuality his duties were more on the order of the rotating electronic technicians he was supposed to be leading.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206, an employee must meet all...of the criteria...[,] to be exempted from FLSA overtime based on the administrative exemption. The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, demonstrate that the grievant does not perform predominantly nonmanual work, and thus does not meet the nonmanual work test under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206(b). Consequently, it is not necessary to address the other two parts of the three-part test. The Agency's arguments fail to establish that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant is nonexempt is contrary to the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.206.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award fails to comply with case law in three respects: (1) the Arbitrator's determinations are based solely on the specialists' PDs without any consideration of the specialists' actual or day-to-day duties; (2) the Arbitrator's determinations rely on the Agency's settlement or concession regarding other specialists as non-exempt; and (3) the Arbitrator's award of liquidated damages is not supported by any legal basis. For the following reasons, we deny these claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's Consideration of the Employees' PDs is Not Contrary to Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under OPM's implementing regulations, "the designation of an employee as FLSA exempt or nonexempt ultimately rests on the duties actually performed by the employee." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202(h)(i). In this connection, courts have followed the regulation's directive to consider the actual duties performed by an employee<span class="Italic">. See Berg, </span>982 F.2d at 503 (the administrative exemption requires examination of employee's specific day-to-day activities); <span class="Italic">Bolduc, </span>35 F. Supp.2d at 113 (a determination of whether an employee is exempt under the FLSA requires an examination of the day-to-day work of an employee). In addition, it is the employer's burden to prove that an employee falls within the professional exemption, <span class="Italic">Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, </span>417 U.S. 188, 196-97 (1974), <span id="page_2116"></span>and the exemption is construed narrowly against the employer who seeks to assert it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arnold, </span>361 U.S. at 392.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's argument that the award conflicts with the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Berg</span> is unavailing. In <span class="Italic">Berg, </span>the Federal Circuit, in addressing whether electronic technicians were exempt administrative employees, ruled that "[t]o determine whether a position fits within the exemption, a trial court must have before it sufficient facts concerning the daily activities of that position to justify its legal conclusion." <span class="Italic">Berg, </span>982 F.2d at 503. The Federal Circuit determined that the record did not contain sufficient facts regarding the day-to-day duties of the technicians to justify the legal conclusion that these employees were exempt and reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment. In this regard, the Federal Circuit found that "[t]he Government's evidence [which] consists of appellants' job description and two conclusory statements from Air Force classifiers[,]...presents no evidence describing appellants' specific job duties<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The court also noted that "[t]he general job description lacks specific facts about appellants' day-to-day activities[, and s]imilarly, the Air Force classifiers supply little, if any, factual basis for their conclusions that appellants fit within the exemption<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Award contains language overstating the importance of PDs in making FLSA determinations, we find that the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator failed to consider the specialists' actual or day-to-day duties in making the exempt status determinations. The Agency argues that the Arbitrator "reject[ed]...the substantive testimony of the [representative employees] as to their day-to-day activities in favor of their static PD's[.]" However, the Arbitrator specifically stated that she relied on: (1) the testimony of the supervisors that "the PDs for [their] employees were correct," and (2) the testimony of the representative employees that their PDs were a "correct statement of the parameters of [their] positions[,]" that is, "the duties and responsibilities of the position[s], the knowledge and skills required to perform the duties, and the amount and type of supervision that will be given." In line with this direct, uncontested testimony of the employees and their supervisors that the PDs were accurate representations of the work performed, the Arbitrator appropriately considered the "set of duties, knowledge required and supervisory controls" delineated in the PDs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, neither party disputes the sufficiency of the record before the Arbitrator. Rather, both parties emphasize that the record was more than sufficient to make the FLSA exempt status determinations.[5] Accordingly, in light of the Arbitrator's consideration of the employees' actual duties and the sufficiency of the record before the Arbitrator, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is deficient as contrary to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Berg </span>or the OPM regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the parties conducted this arbitration exactly as the Federal Circuit has prescribed by designating representatives and presenting evidence from the representative specialists and their supervisors regarding their actual or day-to-day duties. <span class="Italic">See Adams</span> [178 F.3d 1306 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (unpublished)] slip op. at 5.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's Consideration of the Nonexempt Status of Other Employees with the Same or Similar Duties is Not Contrary to Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Agency's argument that the award is contrary to the courts' holdings in <span class="Italic">Bolduc, Reich, and</span> <span class="Italic">Aamold </span>is unpersuasive. In both <span class="Italic">Bolduc</span> and <span class="Italic">Reich</span>, the courts ruled that exempt status determinations must be made on the basis of the employee's actual or day-to-day duties and not the employer's treatment of similarly situated employees with the same title. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bolduc, </span>35 F. Supp.2d at 113 (the court must examine the day-to-day duties of the employee rather than rely on the fact that other employees with the same title were classified as exempt by the employer); <span class="Italic">Reich, </span>44 F.3d at 1075 (the determination of whether an exemption applies to a given employee depends on the specific duties and characteristics required by the position and is independent of the title the employer ascribes to the position). Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Aamold, </span>the court focused on the employee's actual duties as "dispositive" regarding the application of the exemption, and concluded that overall, the record, which consisted of PDs and occupational standards, contained insufficient facts to justify either party's motion for summary judgment. <span class="Italic">Aamold,</span> 39 Fed. Cl. at 742, 747.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bolduc</span> and <span class="Italic">Reich</span> is misplaced since the Arbitrator did not rely merely on the fact that the eight Equipment Specialists at issue had the same <span class="Italic">title </span>as the twenty-one other Equipment Specialists who had been designated as nonexempt. Rather, the Arbitrator concluded that the eight Equipment Specialists were nonexempt based on her specific findings that the knowledge requirements, supervisory controls and duties performed by the designated representatives were the same or virtually the same as other specialists who the Agency conceded did not meet the professional exemption criteria. As noted above, in making these findings, the Arbitrator considered the duties described in the PDs as the actual or day-to-day work of the grievants and the specialists covered by the settlement agreement in line with the testimony of the supervisors to this effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contention--that the Arbitrator is prohibited from considering and relying on exempt status determinations regarding other Equipment Specialists who perform the same or similar duties--is refuted by the decision of at least one reviewing court. In this regard, the Seventh Circuit has made exempt status determinations, based in part on comparisons with other employees. In <span class="Italic">Piscione v. Ernst &#x0026; Young, L.L.P.</span>, 171 F.3d 527 (7th Cir. 1999) (<span class="Italic">Piscione</span>), in deciding whether an employee's duties/activities satisfied the requirements for both the administrative and professional exemptions, the court compared the duties of the employee at hand with similar or analogous duties of employees in other cases. For instance, in determining whether the employee's duties and activities required the exercise of discretion and independent judgment under both the administrative and professional exemption criteria, the court relied on its finding that the employee's duties/skills were "similar to those" of "the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Spinden," </span>who the Eighth Circuit found met this prong of the exemption tests. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 537-38, citing <span class="Italic">Spinden v. GS Roofing Prod. Co., Inc.</span>, 94 F.3d 421, 423-24, 428-29 (8th Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, </span>520 U.S. 1120 (1997). Additionally, the court concluded that "[c]omparing [the employee's] duties with the hypothetical employees used as illustrations in the regulations also clearly demonstrates that his primary duties directly related to the policies or general business operations of [the employer]<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 542. In making such comparisons, the court noted that "[t]he analogy does not need to be perfect; the position needs only to be 'somewhat analogous' to an occupation exempted in the regulations<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 542-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Seventh Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Piscione</span> illustrates that the determination regarding whether an employee's duties satisfy the requirements of the professional exemption in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.207 may be based on an assessment of the employee's duties at issue with the same or comparable duties of other employees whose exempt status has been determined. Here, the Arbitrator's comparison of the duties of the specialists at issue with the duties of the twenty-one nonexempt specialists is consistent with the comparative analytical approach in <span class="Italic">Piscione. </span>As previously mentioned, the Arbitrator concluded that the eight Equipment Specialists were nonexempt based on her specific findings that the knowledge requirements, supervisory controls and duties performed by the designated representatives were the same or virtually the same as other specialists who the Agency conceded did not meet the professional exemption criteria in &#x00A7; 551.207.[6] Accordingly, we defer to the Arbitrator's findings as a sufficient basis for concluding that the employees at issue did not meet the criteria in &#x00A7; 551.207.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The fact that the Arbitrator considered and relied on the status of nonexempt employees resulting from a settlement agreement (versus comparing and relying on exempt status determinations that were made by the courts or included in OPM or DOL's regulations) does not undermine the Arbitrator's determination. We accord the Agency's "concession" or "acknowledgment" that the twenty-one Equipment Specialists were nonexempt the same weight as other exempt status determinations that have been decided on the merits. Moreover, in this case, the settlement agreement does not contain a "non-admission" clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is deficient as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's Award of Liquidated Damages is Not Contrary to Law</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, we reject the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator's award of liquidated damages is without any legal basis. In <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>the Authority delineated the standards for imposing liquidated damages under the FLSA. The Authority stated that the FLSA "in effect, establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime shall be awarded liquidated damages, unless the employer shows that the 'act or omission giving rise [to the violation of the FLSA] was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]." <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>53 FLRA at 1481, citing 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. In this regard, an employer in violation of the FLSA has "a 'substantial burden' of proving that he acted in good faith and on a reasonable belief [that] he was in compliance[,]" and thus "double damages are the norm, single damages are the exception[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Authority noted that "at least one reviewing court has ruled that an employer's failure to take affirmative steps to ascertain its employees' exemption status, particularly where there have been changes in regulation or the employer has information calling into question its employees' status, demonstrates that the employer lacked good faith in complying with the responsibilities imposed by the FLSA." <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA at 1483, citing <span class="Italic">Bankston v. State of Illinois</span>, 60 F.3d 1249, 1255 (7th Cir. 1995). Here, the Agency has offered no evidence that it took affirmative steps that would meet the substantial burden necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of liquidated damages. Thus, we affirm the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the Agency did not act in good faith and find that the award of liquidated damages is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2117"></span>B.&#x2003;The Award is Not Based on Nonfacts</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on nonfacts, the appealing party must demonstrate that central facts underlying the award are clearly erroneous, but for which a different result would have been reached by the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air Force,</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado and National</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497, </span>48 FLRA 589, 593 (1993). An award will not be found deficient based on an arbitrator's determination on any factual matters that the parties disputed below. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 594 (citing <span class="Italic">Mailhandlers v. Postal Service, </span>751 F.2d 834, 843 (6th Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A review of the record reveals that the parties disputed the alleged nonfacts before the Arbitrator regarding whether the exemption status is based exclusively on the PDs and whether the non-exempt status of similarly situated employees is relevant to the status of the employees at issue. In this regard, the Arbitrator noted that the Union argued that "the Agency's exemption decision [regarding the eight specialists] violates the proposition that similarly situated employees should be treated the same for FLSA purposes." Moreover, the Agency's nonfact claims do not challenge the Arbitrator's findings of fact, but rather take issue with the Arbitrator's interpretation of what evidence governs the determination of the professional FLSA exemption. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal</span> <span class="Italic">Trades Council, </span>39 FLRA 590, 605 (1991) (agency's nonfact argument disputing the arbitrator's interpretation of regulation rather than the arbitrator's factual findings provided no basis for finding that the award was based on nonfact).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Award is Not Contrary to Public Policy</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 32 FLRA 765, 767-68 (1988), the Authority stated the following with respect to claims that an award is deficient as contrary to public policy:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under section 7122(a)(2) of the Statute, we will find an arbitration award deficient on grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor relations cases. In the private sector, courts will find an arbitration award deficient when the award is contrary to public policy. However, this ground is "extremely narrow." <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service v. National Association of Letter</span> <span class="Italic">Carriers, </span>810 F.2d 1239, 1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">cert. dismissed, </span>108 S. Ct. 1589 (1988). In order to find the award deficient, the public policy in question must be "explicit, well defined and dominant." <span class="Italic">W.R. Grace &#x0026; Co. v. Rubber Workers,</span> 461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). In addition, the policy is to be ascertained "by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests<span class="Italic">." Id.; accord</span> <span class="Italic">United Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., </span>108 S. Ct. 364, 373 (1987). The violation of such public policy "must be clearly shown" if an award is to be found deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's award is deficient because it is contrary to public policy that fosters compromise and the settlement of litigation/disputes. In this regard, the Agency maintains that the Arbitrator's award was not based on facts and evidence presented by the parties at arbitration, but rather derived from the parties' Partial Settlement Agreement, which would be inadmissible under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency's argument concerning the admissibility of the Partial Settlement Agreement under the Federal Rules of Evidence is without merit, as the Authority has consistently held that the Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to arbitration hearings and awards. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Health and Human</span> <span class="Italic">Services, Social Security Administration, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Hearings and Appeals and American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Local 3615, </span>39 FLRA 407, 413 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the record reveals that the Arbitrator relied not only on the settlement agreement, but also considered the PDs for the twenty-one specialists who were reclassified as nonexempt as a result of the agreement. In this connection, we note that the Arbitrator stated that the PDs for all twenty-nine Equipment Specialists were submitted as "joint exhibits" and that other "exhibits...provided details of the January 8, 1999 settlement for twenty-one of these positions[.]" The Hearing Transcript also confirms that the Agency agreed with the submission of the PDs for the twenty-one nonexempt specialists for the Arbitrator's consideration of the status of the eight specialists at issue. In addition, the parties' Partial Settlement Agreement contains neither a confidentiality clause nor a non-admission clause. Rather, the Partial Settlement Agreement affirmatively states that "[t]he FLSA classification of [the twenty-one specialists] is hereby acknowledged as nonexempt, settled and satisfied[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Indian Head and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 280, 286-87 (2001) (sustaining award of FLSA overtime entitlement based on undisputed testimony that employees' duties were properly described by their position descriptions; agency implicitly sanctioned arbitrator's reliance on position descriptions as accurate representations of actual duties).</p>
