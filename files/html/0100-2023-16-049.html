<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-48"><span class="space">15.</span> Absolute Standard; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An absolute performance standard permits an agency to remove or demote an employee under &#x00A7; 4303 for one failure to meet a performance standard. Through 2004, the law was that absolute standards were generally invalid. <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 592, 598-600 (1984), expressed the law then in effect:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he establishment of absolute performance standards, particularly when the standards evaluate performance of a critical element, would generally be inconsistent with Congressional intent in enacting the performance provisions of the CSRA and could, therefore, constitute an abuse of discretion....&#8197;Absolute performance standards, which do not measure above-satisfactory performance, do not provide the envisioned basis for personnel actions rewarding employees. Rather, such performance standards are often negative, providing only a basis for demoting or removing employees, and impede the statutory purpose to use performance appraisals also as a basis for rewarding employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recognizes, however, that the establishment of an absolute performance standard does not constitute an abuse of discretion in every instance and may be compelled in certain circumstances. Some positions may require that aspects of the incumbent's performance be measured by absolute standards. Examples include situations where death, injury, breach of security, or great monetary loss could result from a single failure to meet the performance standard measuring performance of a critical element. Further, the necessity of using an absolute performance standard for some job elements will not prevent the agency from using performance ratings to reward employees...if other job elements of the performance appraisal plan have non-absolute performance standards which measure above-satisfactory performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329, 1334-37 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the Federal Circuit, while considering whether absolute standards could be waived under the special statutory provisions governing OPM-approved demonstration projects, decided there was nothing generally wrong with absolute standards, avoiding analysis of the demonstration project issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The petitioner argues that the Navy adopted an absolute performance standard; that such standards are barred except "where death, injury, breach of security, or great monetary loss could result from a single failure to meet the performance standard measuring performance of a single critical element," (Br. of Pet'r at 24 n.12 (quoting <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 592, 599 (1984))); and that it does not matter that the standard was not applied to Guillebeau in a rigorous manner. The Navy responds that the standard here was not absolute. We disagree. "The Board has interpreted an absolute performance standard as one providing that a single incident of poor performance will result in an unsatisfactory rating on a job element." <span class="Italic">Boyd v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 435, 439 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's performance standard included four "quality standards":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;All web pages be peer reviewed prior to final submission; (2) all web pages conform to the format for Coastal Systems Station web pages and technical content be at the "public release" level; (3) all issues from the peer review be resolved and comments incorporated into the final submission; and (4) the final submission be provided in electronic and printed form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Final Order, 93 M.S.P.R. at 381 n.3. As the administrative judge found, on their face, these standards are absolute. The petitioner was required to satisfy all four of these standards, and each standard's requirement is absolute because it applies to "all web pages," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, providing no exceptions. In addition, the petitioner's supervisor, testified that, with regard to the four quality standards, "the [petitioner] could make no errors, that it was either all or nothing." We disagree that other evidence supports a finding that the performance standard by its express terms was not absolute. Therefore, the performance standard that applied to the petitioner was absolute, as the administrative judge properly held in the Initial Decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having decided that the substantive requirements of the statute were absolute under the Board's criteria, we must decide whether the statute bars absolute performance standards. The Navy argues that OPM was authorized to waive and did waive the requirements of section 4302 pursuant to section 4703, and thus waived the prohibition of absolute performance standards. Section 4703 was enacted in section 601 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) 1111, 1186-88. That section authorizes OPM to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that ordinarily apply to government personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4703(a). The provision was intended to reduce the centralization and rigid application of the rules governing civil service, which had become problematic under the previous civil service system. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Reform: Hearings on H.R. 11280 Before the House Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 95th Cong. 44-45 (1978) (statement of Alan K. Campbell, Chairman, U.S. Civil Service Commission).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, while Congress "recognized the need to allow OPM adequate flexibility to develop new approaches to Federal personnel management policies and procedures, it was concerned about the dangers inherent <span id="Page_2914"></span>whenever any Federal agency is given authority to waive provisions of law." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 94, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2816. Therefore, the statute imposed limits on OPM's authority under subsection 4703(a). Subsection 4703(c) provided: "No demonstration project under this section may provide for a waiver of...any rule or regulation prescribed under this title, if such waiver is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">any merit system principle</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4703(c)(5) (emphasis added). Section 4703(c)(5) thus prohibits waiver of any of the merit system principles set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301, which is titled "Merit system principles," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301. Among these merit system principles is the principle that "[e]mployees should be retained on the basis of the adequacy of their performance, inadequate performance should be corrected, and employees should be separated who cannot or will not improve their performance to meet required standards." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(6) (emphases added). These basic merit system principles "must be adhered to by agencies in all performance-based actions." <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The questions of whether and to what extent section 4703(c) authorizes waiver of the requirement that agencies establish reasonable performance standards is a difficult one, and we need not decide it here because we conclude that neither the statute nor the regulations bar absolute performance standards, even in the absence of a waiver. Section 4302 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;Under regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, each performance appraisal system shall provide for--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">establishing performance standards which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria</span> (which may include the extent of courtesy demonstrated to the public) <span class="Italic">related to the job in question for each employee or position under the system</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 (emphases added). The Board has interpreted this statute in <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> and subsequent cases as generally barring absolute performance standards. In <span class="Italic">Callaway</span>, the Board noted that "[t]he plain meaning of the statutory language does not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, preclude the use of absolute performance standards" and that "nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to do so." 23 M.S.P.R. at 597. Nevertheless, the Board went on to hold that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the establishment of absolute performance standards, particularly when the standards evaluate performance of a critical element, would generally be inconsistent with Congressional intent in enacting the performance provisions of the CSRA and could, therefore, constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598. In subsequent cases, the Board has further extended its prohibition of absolute performance standards, holding that "their establishment will generally constitute an abuse of discretion unless death, injury, breach of security, or great monetary loss could result from a single failure to meet the performance standard." <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 646, 652 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board thus focuses on the performance standard itself, rather than its application in a particular case. Indeed, the Board has rejected the argument that a performance standard that is absolute on its face can be valid if it is not applied to a particular employee in an absolute manner. <span class="Italic">See Mendez v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 579, 582-83 (1994). Thus, the Board judges performance standards in the abstract, without regard to how the standards are applied to a particular employee in a particular case, unless the employee has received advance notice that the standard would not be applied in an absolute manner. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think that the Board has misconstrued the statute and erroneously created a prohibition of nearly all performance standards that it deems absolute. "The starting point in discerning congressional intent is the existing statutory text.... It is well established that 'when the statute's language is plain, the sole function of the courts--at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd--is to enforce it according to its terms.'" <span class="Italic">Lamie v. United States Tr.</span>, [540 U.S. 526], 124 S. Ct. 1023, 1030 (2004) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A.</span>, 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000)). We thus look first to the text of the statute. The statute itself does not bar absolute performance standards; rather, it merely requires that performance standards, "to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). Indeed, the Board itself noted that the statutory language does not bar absolute performance standards. <span class="Italic">Callaway</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. at 597.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the legislative history support the Board's prohibition of absolute performance standards. The statute was enacted as part of the CSRA. &#x00A7; 203, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. (92 Stat.) at 1132-33. The Senate Report does not indicate that absolute performance standards are to be prohibited; rather, it states that section 4302(b) permits government agencies "great flexibility to choose or develop their own systems." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 42, reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2764. The Report further notes that "[a]gencies should determine what type of performance appraisal methods best suit their needs." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, the legislative history indicates congressional intent to permit government agencies latitude in crafting performance appraisal systems to fit their needs. There is no expression of intent to prohibit absolute performance standards. We conclude that, based upon a careful reading of the statute and the legislative history, the statute is not ambiguous. It cannot be read to bar absolute performance standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we hold that the statute does not bar absolute performance standards, and we specifically disapprove of the Board's decisions in the <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> line of cases. However, there is an extensive body of law, both in our court, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 842, and at the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 441; <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 227, 229 (1985), holding that performance standards must be reasonable, based on objective criteria, and communicated to the employee in advance. Thus, we do not suggest that an agency may adopt an unreasonable standard or that absolute performance standards are always reasonable. For example, it might be unreasonable for an agency to adopt a standard permitting so few errors in pulling medical records from files that, based upon the number of records the employee is required to pull, the employee must be at least 99.91% accurate. <span class="Italic">Blain v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 322, 325 (1988). But the petitioner has not argued on this appeal that the performance standard here was invalid because it was unreasonable, only that it was invalid because it was absolute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. at 441 (holding that "although the [agency's] remaining standards are not absolute, they are invalid because they are unreasonable"). Here, it is quite clear that the Board also concluded that the performance standard was not implemented in an unreasonable manner. As the Board noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The agency] did not deem [Guillebeau's] performance unacceptable because one of a number of the web pages she was tasked with designing was not peer reviewed or did not conform to the appropriate format, or because less than 100% of the technical content was at the "public release" level. It did not find her performance unacceptable because she made a single error in that regard that justified her removal. Rather, the agency found, and indeed the appellant does not deny, that she simply failed to complete the assigned work during the period provided, even as extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Final Order, 93 M.S.P.R. at 383 (citation omitted). That aspect of the decision is supported by substantial evidence. The performance standard applied to the petitioner, although it was absolute, was applied to her reasonably. The petitioner was removed for failure to complete her assigned work, despite several deadline extensions. Such a removal is permissible.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Readily adopting <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span> as controlling, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 97 MSPR 13, 16-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16 (2004), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this appeal to address the Board's law concerning performance standards under Chapter 43. We believe that it would be helpful to recap the congressional intent in enacting Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress enacted Chapter 43 in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. The legislative history and intent of Congress in enacting Chapter 43 is fully explained in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Federal Home Loan Bank Board</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 633 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 769 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As discussed in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span>, Congress intended that Chapter 43 would give managers a "more effective and equitable means of managing...employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 637. The Board in <span class="Italic">Lisiecki</span> quoted the congressional history that noted concern over the "widely held impression...that a government employee cannot be fired, regardless of unacceptable performance or work performance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 639 (footnote and citations omitted). In enacting Chapter 43, Congress intended to create a "streamlined statutory scheme for actions based on unacceptable performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). Congress made it clear that it wanted Chapter 43 actions to be subject to a "less intrusive review of the agency decision" by the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citation omitted). Instead, Congress intended that Chapter 43 have "both the intent and the effect of fundamentally limiting the Board's scope of review and standard or review" of the action and the performance standards. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 641. It is within this legislative context that we adjudicate this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 4303 of Chapter 43, an agency must only show that the appellant's performance standards meet the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359 &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Section 4302(b)(1) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, each performance appraisal system shall provide for establishing performance standards which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria (which may include the extent of <span id="Page_2915"></span>courtesy demonstrated to the public) related to the job in question for each employee or position under the system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has interpreted this language as prohibiting an "absolute" performance standard, that is, one under which a single incident of poor performance will result in an unsatisfactory rating on a critical element. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mendez v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 579, 582 (1994); <span class="Italic">Hurd v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Interior</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 107, 111 (1992); <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Department of Commerce</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 243, 247 (1986). As first stated in <span class="Italic">Callaway v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 592, 596-600 (1984), and repeated in later decisions, an agency is not permitted to evaluate an employee's performance under a standard that requires the employee to achieve an "absolute" or unreasonably high level of performance. <span class="Italic">E.g., Boyd v. Department of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 435 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 13 (2001); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359 &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Mendez</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 583; <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 227, 229 (1985). Board law has evolved to the point that the "reasonableness" of the performance standards has become an established criterion for evaluating performance standards. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 435 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 13; <span class="Italic">Wright v. Department of Labor</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 186 &#x00B6; 16 (1999); <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 229.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the AJ found that the appellant's performance standards regarding the critical elements of customer satisfaction and patient care would have allowed no more than one to two valid exceptions during a rating period, without taking into account the number of customer/patient contacts the appellant had in the rating period or the nature of her job. Under then-current Board law, the AJ found the standards improperly absolute or near absolute. <span class="Italic">See Boyd</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 435 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accord with the intent of Congress in enacting Chapter 43, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2004), clarified that the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) does not bar absolute performance standards. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1336. After examining the language of Chapter 43 and its legislative history, the Federal Circuit stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the legislative history indicates congressional intent to permit government agencies latitude in crafting performance appraisal systems to fit their needs. There is no expression of intent to prohibit absolute performance standards. We conclude that, based on a careful reading of the statute and the legislative history, the statute is not ambiguous. It cannot be read to bar absolute performance standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1337 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, now hold that the Board's prior interpretation of section 4302(b)(1) went beyond the plain language of the statute. The plain language of the statute, quoted above, requires the use of "objective" job-related criteria enabling the rating official to make an "accurate evaluation of job performance" and requires that these criteria be set out "to the maximum extent feasible" in the performance standards. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1). The statute, its implementing regulations, and the statutory history do not prohibit absolute performance standards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. Part 432; S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2764 (1978) ("agencies will have great flexibility to choose or develop their own [performance appraisal] systems" and "[a]gencies should determine what type of performance appraisal methods best suit their needs").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, under Chapter 43, agencies do <span class="Italic">not</span> have to establish that actions taken for unacceptable performance "promote the efficiency of the service"; that is, agencies are not required to establish a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for such action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his or her duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301(3), 4303(a); S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2765; <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 585, 596 (1981). Rather, the statutory focus of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) is the measurement of performance based on objective criteria. Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) does not preclude the use of absolute performance standards, so long as those standards are objective and tailored to the specific requirements of the position. By delving into whether performance standards are "absolute" or applying a subjective standard, the Board strayed from the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The managers of federal agencies, not the members of the Board, have the authority to decide what agency employees must do in order to perform acceptably in their particular positions. <span class="Italic">See Kruger v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 471 &#x00B6; 13 (2004) (an agency is entitled to use its managerial discretion in establishing the performance standards by which an employee's performance is to be measured); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188 &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (same); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span> <span class="Italic">v.</span> <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 534 U.S. 1, 7 (2001) ("a presumption of regularity attaches to the actions of Government agencies...and...some deference to agency disciplinary actions is appropriate"); <span class="Italic">McClaskey v. Department of Energy</span>, 720 F.2d 583, 588 n.2 (9th Cir. 1983) (management expertise resides with the agency, not the Board or court); <span class="Italic">Luciano v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 335 &#x00B6; 13 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 30 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give due weight to the agency's primary discretion in maintaining employee discipline and efficiency; the Board's function is not to displace management's responsibility, but to ensure that managerial judgment has been properly exercised). Thus, under a plain-language interpretation of section 4302(b)(1), an agency is free to set its performance standards as high as it thinks appropriate, so long as those standards are objective and meet the other express requirements of section 4302(b)(1). Accordingly, we overrule <span class="Italic">Callaway</span> and other Board precedent to the extent that such precedent examines an agency's performance standards to determine whether the standards are "absolute" or otherwise subjectively unacceptable in the Board's view. The Board's review of performance standards must focus on whether the standards measure the performance of the job in question on the basis of the objective criteria set forth by the agency and whether they meet the other express requirements of section 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore follow the law on performance standards set forth by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span>, which is that Chapter 43 does not bar absolute performance standards. 362 F.3d at 1337. However, as the court stated, the performance standards "must be reasonable, based on objective criteria, and communicated to the employee in advance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court did not say that an agency may adopt an unreasonable standard or that absolute standards are always reasonable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The inquiry, instead, must be case specific.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the inquiry as to the reasonableness of the standards, even if they are absolute, is case specific, this appeal must be remanded to give the parties a chance to address the validity of the appellant's performance standards under the law set forth above and for new findings and conclusions on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haywood v.</span> <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 603, 610-12 (1994) (it was inappropriate to decide a case under a newly-announced rule without first remanding the case to allow the parties to address the application of the new rule).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson</span> was cited with approval, without mention of <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span>, in <span class="Italic">Noble v. DOJ</span>, 497 Fed. Appx. 18, 20 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may utilize an "absolute" performance standard--i.e., under which a single incident of poor performance will result in an unsatisfactory rating on a critical element--"so long as those standards are objective and tailored to the specific requirements of the position." <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 13, 17-18 (2004). The standard applied by the agency in this case, however, was not "absolute." Ms. Noble was not removed for a single incident of poor performance. Rather, as set forth in the notice of proposed removal, and the deciding official's decision, Ms. Noble's removal resulted from fifteen charged instances of deficient performance, twelve of which the AJ determined the agency had proved. As noted, Ms. Noble was removed from her position after she failed, during the PIP period, to meet the requirements of Critical Elements 1 and 2 of her Work Plan. Neither the PIP nor the Work Plan suggests that the standard for meeting the requirements of these elements was absolute. In addition, Mr. Lodge testified that the U.S. Attorney's Office did not have a policy of zero tolerance for errors. For these reasons, the agency's standards were not absolute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's blessing to the "as high as it thinks appropriate" language of <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Sanders v. SSA</span>, 114 MSPR 487, 493 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 155 (2010).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span> is not favorable for employees. Agencies can use performance standards that read like job descriptions and, deciding that an employee is not performing adequately, issue a PIP that provides some detail, e.g., some specific assignments with some deadlines, or somewhat arbitrary performance measurements, consider the employee's performance for a couple months, and then fire the employee with no chance of mitigation if the agency can support its case before the Board. In short, the real development of the performance standard can be delayed until the PIP, when supervisors or managers have already decided that the employee's performance is subpar and needs to be dealt with through means likely to lead to his removal. Some agencies, recognizing the absolute standards may be applied unreasonably, still prohibit them in their performance appraisal systems.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dobson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 283 Fed. Appx. 818, 819-21 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), upheld a standard that was taken from a position description, with reliance on <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span> and on the evidence that the standards were communicated through the PIP and through supervisory instructions to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dobson worked as a human resources specialist at the Navy's Military Sealift Command in Virginia Beach, Virginia. In 2005, Mr. Dobson was sent a letter of caution about his job performance, and in 2006 he was placed on a performance improvement plan ("PIP"). The plan included a description of Mr. Dobson's past job performance problems, how Mr. Dobson could improve his work, and the details of how he would be monitored during a 60-day evaluation period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the end of the monitoring period, the Navy proposed to remove Mr. Dobson based on five violations of "critical element #2" of the performance appraisal system. That element set forth the following requirements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2916"></span>Accepts work assignments, properly follows instructions, uses technical knowledge, applies skills and plans, organizes and works effectively and efficiently to produce products and/or services of good quality in a timely and responsive manner. Anticipates and analyzes problems and determines solutions that include improvement of work processes. Promotes teamwork: works well with others and takes responsibility as either a team leader or team member as required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Dobson had an opportunity to respond to the notice, the Navy removed him for unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dobson appealed his removal to the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge who was assigned to the appeal upheld Mr. Dobson's removal. The full Board denied a petition for review. Mr. Dobson now petitions for review by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359 (2000), Mr. Dobson first argues that the PIP was invalid because it held him to an impermissible "absolute" standard of performance. However, this court has disapproved the line of Board decisions that includes <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> on the ground that chapter 43 of Title 5, which governs performance appraisals of federal employees and adverse actions based on unacceptable performance, does not prohibit the use of absolute standards. <span class="Italic">Guillebeau v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span> emphasizes that performance standards must be "reasonable, based on objective criteria, and communicated to the employee in advance." 362 F.3d at 1337. The court added that by holding that there is no strict bar to absolute performance standards, it did not mean to suggest "that an agency may adopt an unreasonable standard or that absolute performance standards are always reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court made clear, however, that a demanding standard is not necessarily an unreasonable one. Indeed, even in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, on which Mr. Dobson relies, the Board upheld a performance standard system that permitted the employee to receive no more than four customer complaints during her evaluation period. 87 M.S.P.R. at 366-67. In this case, Mr. Dobson was presented with a list of criteria describing critical element #2, and he was allowed two errors. Although he objects to that standard, he has not presented any specific argument as to why that number of errors, although small, represented an unreasonable error rate, nor has he provided any reason to believe that the required level of performance was unobtainable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dobson argues that the PIP was invalid because critical element #2 was too vague. He contends that the Navy simply used part of his position description rather than a standard explicitly designed for evaluation purposes. The administrative judge concluded that the part of the PIP that Mr. Dobson was charged with violating, critical element #2, was valid, stating that "the evidence of record does not show, and the appellant has not established, that the cited performance element and associated performance standard was vague, unreasonable, improper, and/or unattainable."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative judge noted that "[p]erformance elements and standards may be derived from the employee's official position description." The administrative judge also found that Mr. Dobson had never asked his supervisors for clarification of any of the elements, although he was given several opportunities to do so. Accordingly, we reject Mr. Dobson's argument that the Board erred in concluding that the PIP was invalid on the ground that it was too vague.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his reply brief, Mr. Dobson directs this court's attention to several Board decisions to support his assertion that the PIP was impermissibly vague. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 340 (1993) ("<span class="Italic">Smith I</span>"); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 644 (1991); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 110 (1991) ("<span class="Italic">Smith II</span>"); <span class="Italic">Shuman v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 620 (1984). However, <span class="Italic">Smith I</span> is among the cases that were disapproved by <span class="Italic">Guillebeau</span>, discussed above. <span class="Italic">Shuman</span> addresses only the right of an employee to present evidence as to whether performance standards were been adequately communicated, 23 M.S.P.R. at 632-33, and Mr. Dobson does not allege that he was precluded from presenting any such evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining two cases address the issue of vagueness, but they do not warrant overturning the Board's findings in this case. In <span class="Italic">Smith II</span>, the Board affirmed the administrative judge's determination that the use of the word "sometimes" in a standard for marginally acceptable performance was impermissibly vague. 49 M.S.P.R. at 116. By contrast, in this case the administrative judge found that critical element #2 was not impermissibly vague, and the holding in <span class="Italic">Smith II</span> provides no basis for overturning that highly factual inquiry as a matter of law, especially given the differences between the standard in that case and the one at bar, which notably does not use any word such as "sometimes." In <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, the Board determined that the performance improvement plan identified unacceptable performance through the use of negative terms rather than identifying the conduct that was necessary to achieve minimally acceptable performance. 49 M.S.P.R. at 650-51. In this case, the Board concluded that critical element #2 identified what was required for acceptable performance. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span> does not warrant overturning the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dobson asserts that his removal must be overturned because his supervisors "did not fully comprehend" the performance appraisal system, and that they did not communicate it to him adequately. In his reply brief, Mr. Dobson further develops that argument, citing <span class="Italic">Jimenez-Howe v. Department of Labor</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 202 (1987), and <span class="Italic">Smith II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Jimenez-Howe</span>, the Board explained that the communication requirement would be satisfied if the agency communicated "to the employee the standards he must meet in order to be evaluated as demonstrating performance at a level which is sufficient for retention" and that agencies "may give sufficient specificity to their performance standards by written and oral instructions to meet the statutory requirements." 35 M.S.P.R. at 207-08 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Smith II</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 116-17 ("an agency must communicate to the employee performance standards that are sufficiently specific to provide the employee with a firm benchmark toward which to aim his performance, and not an elusive goal that the agency may find the employee met or failed to meet at its pleasure"). In Mr. Dobson's case, the Board found that Mr. Dobson's supervisors understood the standards and that they attempted to communicate them to Mr. Dobson through the performance improvement plan and through verbal communication from his first-level supervisor. Mr. Dobson's arguments do not undermine those findings made by the Board, which are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Chandhok v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> DC-0432-17-0812-I-9 (NP 5/1/2023), rejected arguments that standards were absolute, despite an agency regulation and union contract provision precluding absolute standards, when performance direction was provided in and during the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the appellant's argument regarding the proper analytical framework for considering any violation of agency policy. The appellant directs us to <span class="italic">Cross v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 353, 358-59 (1984), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985), to assert that the harmful error test does not apply to the agency's alleged violation of its own policies regarding absolute standards. But Cross merely recognized that certain statutory requirements described in chapter 43 are not subject to the harmful error test; it cannot be reasonably interpreted as reaching the same conclusion about an agency's internal policies regarding absolute performance standards. <span class="italic">Cross</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 356-59. Therefore, we find the harmful error test appropriate. <span class="italic">See Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 7 (2015) (recognizing that the Board will not sustain an agency decision if the appellant proves a harmful error, i.e., a procedural error that was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that, even if the agency had a policy prohibiting absolute standards, and even if the agency violated that policy, the appellant failed to prove that the error was harmful. As detailed in the initial decision and discussed below, the agency did not find the appellant's performance unacceptable because of any single mistake or single instance of untimeliness. It found his performance unacceptable because of many mistakes and many missed deadlines.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What does OPM say about absolute standards? From that agency's guidance, "Developing Performance Standards":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performance standards should be objective, measurable, realistic, and stated clearly in writing (or otherwise recorded). The standards should be written in terms of specific measurers that will be used to appraise performance. In order to develop specific measurers, you first must determine the general measure(s) that are important for each element. General measurers used to measure employee performance include the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Quality address how well the work is performed and/or how accurate or how effective the final product is. Quality refers to accuracy, appearance, usefulness, or effectiveness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Quantity addresses how much work is produced. A quantity measure can be expressed as an error rate, such as number ore percentage of errors allowable per unit of work, or as a general result to be achieved. When a quality or quantity standard is set, the Fully Successful standard should be high enough to be challenging but not so high that it is not really achievable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Timeliness addresses how quickly, when or by what date the work is produced. <span class="Italic">The most common error made in setting timeliness standards is to allow no margin for error.</span> As with other standards, timeliness standards should be set realistically in view of other performance requirements and needs of the organization.

<p class="Body-Text">From OPM's guidance, "What to Avoid When Writing Standards":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Avoid Absolute Retention Standards</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "absolute" retention standard--one that allows for no errors--is acceptable only in very limited circumstances. When a single failure to perform under a critical element could result in loss of life, injury, breach of national security, or great monetary loss, an agency can legitimately defend its decision to require perfection from its employees. In other circumstances, the MSPB and the courts usually will find that the agency abused its discretion by establishing retention standards that allow for no margin of error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When writing standards, you should avoid the appearance of requiring perfection at the retention level. In appraisal programs that do not appraise elements at the Minimally Successful or equivalent level, you must word carefully the Fully Successful or equivalent standards so that they are not absolute. For example, the following Fully Successful standards would be considered absolute retention standards if they were used by agencies in a two-level appraisal program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Work is timely, efficient, and of good quality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Communicates effectively within and outside of the organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These standards are considered absolute because they appear to require that work is always timely, efficient, and of acceptable quality, or that the employee always communicates effectively. When writing standards--especially retention standards--avoid simply listing tasks without describing the regularity of the occurrence of the task, but also avoid the requirement to do it always.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the examples listed above, some minor editing could resolve the problem:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">With few exceptions, work is timely, efficient, and of good quality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On a routine basis, communicates effectively within and outside of the organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To help determine whether you are writing an absolute standard, ask yourself:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">How many times may the employee fail this requirement and still be acceptable?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Does the retention standard use words such as "all," "never," and "each"? (These words do not automatically create an absolute standard, but they often alert you to problems.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the retention standard allows for no errors, would it be valid according to the criteria listed above (risk of death, injury, etc.)?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/what-to-avoid-when-writing-standards">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/performance-management-cycle/planning/what-to-avoid-when-writing-standards/</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM guidance appears current, so the fair implication from OPM is that absolute standards, those requiring perfection, are inappropriate.
