<p class="Body-Text">The Board may relieve an appellant of the consequences of the decision to withdraw an appeal when the decision was based on misleading or incorrect information from the AJ. The Board set aside the withdrawal of an appeal after the AJ failed to correct the appellant's erroneous belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because of the earlier filing of an EEO complaint, <span class="Italic">Scarboro v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 494, 496-98 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his acknowledgment order, the administrative judge advised the appellant that the Board "may not have jurisdiction to decide [her] appeal at (that) time [because she had] filed a formal discrimination complaint with (the) agency concerning the matter (she was) appealing to the Board." During a June 30, 1992 conference call with the parties' representatives, the administrative judge stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This conference call was suggested by Ms. Farrow (the agency's representative, who advised me that) it appeared that the appellant wished to withdraw the case pending before me now because it appeared that the Board did not have jurisdiction and the appellant wanted to pursue the EEO matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's representative concurred with the administrative judge's statement of the appellant's position, and also stated that she was authorized to speak on the appellant's behalf. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal that same day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality, and in the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn<span class="Italic">. Hoke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 362, 364 (1991) (citations omitted). The circumstances presented here, however, are sufficiently unusual, as detailed below, to warrant a departure from the general rule that appellant-initiated withdrawals be accorded finality.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant chose to withdraw her appeal because she believed that the Board lacked jurisdiction. The administrative judge evidently harbored the same belief. That belief was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may relieve an appellant of the consequences of his or her decision to withdraw an appeal when the decision was based on misleading or incorrect information<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Taylor v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 241 (1985) (the Board vacated the initial decision dismissing the appeal based on the appellant's withdrawal, and remanded the matter for adjudication on the merits, where the appellant may have relied on incorrect advice from the regional office to the effect that the appellant was required to choose between grievance procedures and Board procedures); <span class="Italic">Gray v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 MSPR 78 (1984) (the Board ruled that the appeal would be reinstated if, as alleged, the appellant chose to withdraw his appeal because he had been misinformed by the agency regarding retirement benefits; the Board remanded the matter for a determination of whether the appellant actually had been misinformed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 582 (1991), the appellant withdrew his appeal based on an apparent belief that his only choice was between a hearing and withdrawal (the appellant had consistently indicated that he wished to have his appeal adjudicated on the record). During a telephone conference call, the administrative judge had an opportunity to advise the appellant that he could have his appeal adjudicated without a hearing, but he failed to do so<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 585. On petition for review, the Board reinstated the appeal and remanded the matter to the regional office for adjudication on the merits<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the express reason for the appellant's withdrawal was her erroneous belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction. As in <span class="Italic">Dodd</span>, the administrative judge was in a position during a conference call to correct the appellant's erroneous belief, but he failed to do so. In addition, there is nothing to indicate that, in withdrawing her appeal, the appellant intended to forfeit forever her right to challenge her separation before the Board. Under the unique circumstances presented, we shall reinstate this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Potter v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brooks v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 551, 553-54 (1995), discussed reinstatement of an appeal because of incomplete, material information from an AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality and, absent unusual circumstances, the Board will not reinstate the appeal once it has been withdrawn. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scarboro v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 494, 496 (1992); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 499, 502 (1990). The Board may relieve the appellant of the consequences of his or her decision to withdraw the appeal, however, where the decision was based on incorrect or misleading information. <span class="Italic">See Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 582 (1991), the appellant withdrew his appeal based on an apparent belief that his only choice was between a hearing and withdrawal (the appellant had consistently indicated that he wished to have his appeal adjudicated on the documentary record). During a telephone conference call, the administrative judge had the opportunity to advise the appellant that he could have his appeal adjudicated without a hearing, but failed to do so<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 585. On petition for review, the Board reinstated the appeal, and remanded the matter to the regional office for adjudication on the merits<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Scarboro</span>, cited above, the appellant's reason for withdrawing her appeal was her erroneous belief that the Board lacked jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 497-98. As in <span class="Italic">Dodd</span>, the administrative judge was in a position, during a conference call, to correct the appellant's mistaken belief, but failed to do so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On petition for review, the Board reinstated the appeal and remanded it to the regional office for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's express reason for withdrawing her appeal was her mistaken belief that she could pursue her mixed-case discrimination claims before the EEOC, independently of the Board<span class="Italic">. See Davis v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 120, 123 (1988) (to fall within the mixed-case procedure, discrimination issues must be properly raised before the Board in the first instance; EEOC's jurisdiction over a mixed case extends only to those discrimination issues that have been properly presented to the Board in the first instance). In an Order issued on October 7, 1994, memorializing a settlement conference, the administrative judge noted that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Pursuant to the agency's inquiry, the appellant's representative stated that he is <span class="Italic">not</span> raising a Title VII disparate treatment claim in this appeal, and went on to say that they have been careful to keep the issues separate. The appellant's representative stated unequivocally that no formal EEO complaint has been filed concerning the matter under appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant filed an exception to the Order, noting through her representative that she had filed an informal Equal Employment Opportunity complaint, and indicating that she "intend[ed] to proceed with those issues before the EEOC....&#8197;Thus, the administrative judge was aware of the appellant's erroneous reason for withdrawing her appeal, and he had the opportunity to inform her of the legal consequences of withdrawing her appeal. The administrative judge noted in the initial decision that he advised the appellant that she would not be entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the EEOC on her discrimination claims, and he also filed a memorandum to that effect dated the same day the initial decision was issued. However, the appellant contends that she was not provided with this information until <span class="Italic">after</span> she had withdrawn her appeal, and the record is unclear as to when the appellant was notified that the EEOC would be unavailable to her. We find that, under these circumstances, where the administrative judge was in a position to correct the appellant's erroneous belief and to inform her of the consequences of withdrawing her appeal, but failed to do so despite numerous opportunities, reinstatement of the appeal is warranted<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 497-98; <span class="Italic">Dodd</span>, 48 MSPR at 585.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Incorrect information from the AJ on the substance of the case, delivered to the appellant <span class="Italic">ex parte,</span> and resulting in withdrawal of the appeal led the Board to reinstate the appeal, <span class="Italic">Wieser v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 388, 390-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 2006 MSPB 61 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant chose to withdraw his appeal because of information that he allegedly received in what appears to have been a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication with the AJ in this case regarding the merits of the appellant's appeal. [<span class="Italic">See</span>] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.101, 1201.102 (<span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications are those made to an interested party to the proceeding and are prohibited if they involve the merits of the case or violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 504, 508 (1995). Of particular concern is the appellant's assertion that he relied, at least in part, on the AJ's determination that an agency can be "arbitrary" with regard to reassigning its employees. This statement is clearly contrary to Board law because, if an adverse action is based upon an employee's failure to accept a directed reassignment, as occurred in the present case, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its decision to reassign the employee was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and based upon legitimate management reasons. <span class="Italic">See Shenwick v. Department of State</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 9 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It therefore appears that the appellant based his decision to withdraw his appeal on misinformation provided by the AJ. Furthermore, the agency stated that it was not involved in the July 6, 2005 conversation between the appellant and the AJ, and that it does not object to reinstating the appellant's appeal. Given the unusual circumstances presented in this case, we shall reinstate the appellant's appeal. <span class="Italic">See Scarboro</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 498.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ erred by dismissing an appeal when the appellant wanted adjudication but was unclear on how adjudication would proceed, <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dept. of Army</span>, 67 MSPR 376, 377-78 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a GS-11 Mechanical Engineering Technician, retired from his position effective October 30, 1992. Subsequently, the appellant filed a discrimination complaint with the agency, alleging that his retirement had been coerced....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then timely filed an appeal with the Board alleging that his retirement was involuntary. After the administrative judge had held a telephone pre-hearing conference, the appellant submitted a letter to the administrative judge requesting that the "hearing be postponed and the case remanded back to the [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] EEOC for a determination regarding the reprisals." He further stated that, "[i]n the alternative," he would "withdraw [his] request for [a] hearing."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant had withdrawn his appeal. Accordingly, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. As to the appellant's request that the appeal be "remanded" to the EEOC, the administrative judge stated that he lacked the authority to take such an action, but that the appellant could simply notify the EEOC that he wished to proceed with his reprisal allegation and that his retirement from the service was not a consideration in his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that he only withdrew his request for a hearing, and that he never intended to withdraw his appeal. Consequently, he contends that the administrative judge incorrectly dismissed his appeal. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his letter, the appellant did not state that he wished to withdraw his appeal. Rather, he requested that the administrative judge postpone the hearing, and remand the case "back to the EEOC for a determination regarding the reprisals." In the alternative, the appellant stated that he would withdraw his request for a hearing. Although we agree that the administrative judge properly declined to remand the case to either the EEOC or the agency, we find that, since the appellant had never requested to withdraw his appeal, the administrative judge should not have dismissed it. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scarboro v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 494, 498 (1992) (Board reinstated appeal, where its withdrawal was based on erroneous reason that Board lacked jurisdiction over appeal, and there was nothing to indicate that, in withdrawing her appeal, employee intended to forfeit her right forever to challenge separation before Board); <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 582, 584-85 (1991) (Board reinstated appeal because appellant was consistent in his desire to have appeal adjudicated on record and withdrew his appeal based on belief that his only choice was between requesting a hearing or withdrawing his appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 486, 489-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8, 2010 MSPB 64 (2010), the appellant seemed to express some confusion in her notice withdrawing her appeal, involving restoration rights following a job-related injury, but the Board declined to permit the appeal to be refilled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 22, 2009, the parties submitted a settlement agreement, in which the appellant agreed to withdraw her Board appeal, and the agency agreed that she could grieve the matter instead. During a July 28, 2009 telephonic conference, memorialized in the July 29, 2009 initial decision, the administrative judge advised the parties that, since the appellant was already entitled to pursue a grievance, the agreement was unenforceable due to lack of consideration. The appellant subsequently filed a notice of withdrawal, which she signed personally. The notice stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Agency has restored the appellant to duty. Pursuant to a teleconference with the [administrative judge] today to discuss a previously signed settlement agreement with the Agency, the Appellant knowingly withdraws her MSPB appeal and shall pursue her grievance appeal on the matter through the Collective Bargaining Agreement process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although the Appellant does not fully comprehend how withdrawing her MSPB appeal gives her anything different than the previous settlement this submission is hereby made to address any concerns of the [administrative judge] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1093"></span>The administrative judge dismissed the case, finding that the appellant had clearly and unequivocally withdrawn her appeal. The initial decision noted that there had been no determination as to whether the matter was within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 27, 2009, the appellant petitioned for review of the initial decision, asserting that her withdrawal was "an act of frustration" and the result of "misinformation" by the administrative judge. She contends that, at the June 26, 2009 status conference, the administrative judge informed her that there was no process for recovery of the annual leave she used while off duty and insisted that she withdraw her appeal because the Board lacks jurisdiction. According to the appellant, the administrative judge also informed her that arbitration could take up to 10 years. The appellant reiterates her objections to the administrative judge's decision to deny her motion to compel, and also complains that the administrative judge failed to facilitate settlement. She further states that she was "confounded" by the administrative judge's "confusing" rulings on discovery and jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality which removes the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Page v. Department of Transportation,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 492, &#x00B6; 5 (2009). A voluntary withdrawal must be clear, decisive, and unequivocal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The record reflects that the appellant unequivocally expressed her intent to withdraw the appeal, both in the agreement and in the withdrawal letter that followed. Although she expressed confusion as to why the administrative judge did not accept the withdrawal of her appeal pursuant to the settlement agreement, she made clear that she wished to withdraw her appeal regardless. Moreover, the appellant has not shown that her decision to withdraw the appeal was involuntary due to misinformation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's change of mind, and her assertion that she withdrew her appeal out of frustration, do not constitute grounds for review. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 501, 502 (1986)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was reinstated when the AJ failed to correct the appellant's misunderstanding of whether his appeal could be refiled if the agency did not meet a condition of a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">Magnuson v. DOJ</span>, 68 MSPR 165, 168-69 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's decision to withdraw his initial appeal was influenced by the administrative judge's failure to correct the appellant's erroneous belief that he was withdrawing his appeal without prejudice and that he could reinstate his appeal if the agency denied his hardship transfer request. The settlement agreement, which the parties submitted to the administrative judge, expressly provided that the appellant agreed to the dismissal of his appeal without prejudice, and that the appellant would be allowed to reinstate his appeal if the agency denied his new hardship transfer request. The agency concedes that the parties contemplated that the appellant would be allowed to reinstate his appeal upon the denial of his hardship transfer request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the telephonic conference call at which the appellant withdrew his appeal, the administrative judge had an opportunity to advise the appellant that his appeal would be dismissed with prejudice and that he would not be allowed to refile his appeal, but the administrative judge did not do so. There is no indication that, in withdrawing his appeal, the appellant intended to forfeit forever his right to challenge his alleged involuntary downgrade before the Board<span class="Italic">. See Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 498. Because the appellant's decision to withdraw his appeal was influenced by misinformation regarding whether he could reinstate his appeal upon the agency's denial of his hardship transfer request, we hereby reinstate the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ was not placed on notice that the withdrawal was conditioned upon settlement, a withdrawal is not divested of finality when an appellant withdraws an appeal under the mistaken impression that he would settle matters with the agency. <span class="Italic">Lapedis v. DHHS</span>, 47 MSPR 337, 341 (1991). The Federal Circuit affirmed: MSPB appeals are not governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allowing the withdrawal of a case to be treated as a dismissal without prejudice to refiling on a timely basis. <span class="Italic">Lapedis v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3308).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was reinstated in <span class="Italic">Amante v. Dept. of Army</span>, 77 MSPR 636, 637-38 (1998), after what appeared to be a misunderstanding resulting from a conversation between the AJ and the appellant concerning the benefit to the appellant's employment record that would follow withdrawal of his appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency determined that the appellant should be removed based upon a charge of falsification of official documents. The appellant retired the day before the agency's removal action was to become effective. He timely appealed to the Board, claiming that the agency wrongfully terminated him. The administrative judge issued an initial decision that dismissed the appeal after the appellant advised the administrative judge in a telephone conversation that he wished to withdraw his appeal. The appellant, who is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, promptly sent a letter to the administrative judge in which he disputed the initial decision. In this letter, which was ultimately considered as a timely petition for review of the initial decision, the appellant asserts that, upon receipt of the initial decision, he realized that his case was not resolved as he had thought it would be when he withdrew his appeal. Specifically, he claims that, based upon his telephone conversation with the administrative judge, he believed that if he withdrew his appeal, the agency would remove all references to its falsification charge from his personnel file and that the record would reflect that he voluntarily retired. The agency has not responded to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality, and in the absence of unusual circumstances such as misinformation or new and material evidence, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once it has been withdrawn. <span class="Italic">Scarboro v. Department of the Navy,</span> 55 MSPR 494, 496 (1992); <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 582, 584-85 (1991). Specifically, the Board may relieve an appellant of the consequences of his or her decision to withdraw an appeal when the decision was based upon misleading or incorrect information. <span class="Italic">Scarboro</span>, 55 MSPR at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon receipt of the initial decision, the appellant recognized that his case was not resolved as he had thought it would be when he withdrew his appeal and he promptly filed a petition for review. Under the particular circumstances of this case, namely, the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, his prompt letter to the administrative judge regarding the initial decision, his apparently erroneous belief or misunderstanding regarding the consequences of his withdrawal of his appeal, and the lack of any memorialization in the record of what occurred during his telephone conversation with the administrative judge, we remand this appeal to the regional office for adjudication of its merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another misunderstanding--not characterized by the Board as misrepresentation--led to restoration of an appeal, <span class="Italic">Drummond v. DOD</span>, 91 MSPR 231, 233-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant filed an apparently untimely petition for review of the ID alleging, among other things, that the agency had acted in bad faith by refusing to cancel the removal action or make appropriate "corrections" to his personnel file. He requested a waiver of the filing deadline, and, at the request of the Clerk of the Board, submitted a declaration under penalty of perjury stating, in pertinent part, that his late filing should be excused because he "aggressively pursued this matter" and due to "lack of communication by the [a]gency[.] "...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board may relieve an appellant of the consequences of his decision to withdraw an appeal when the decision was based on misleading or incorrect information. <span class="Italic">Amante v. Department of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 636, 638 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In filing this appeal, the appellant sought to overturn his removal and be carried in leave without pay status by the agency. As previously noted, the appellant's removal appeal was withdrawn at his request because OPM had granted him a disability retirement annuity and resolved a separate appeal. The memorandum of the June 8, 2001 telephone conference below shows that the appellant requested withdrawal of his removal appeal, and that he understood he would not be able to refile the same appeal at a later date before the Board or any other forum. However, the appellant alleges in his petition for review that the administrative judge advised him that "the removal action by DoD/DFAS [was] moot" because of OPM's grant of disability retirement.* The appellant further asserts he also "understood that DoD/DFAS would cancel the action removing him from the agency and enter the proper disability codes in his Official Personnel File (OPF), the personnel system, and the Defense Civilian Pay System," and that "[his] consent to [d]ismiss was contingent upon the OPF and relative pay and personnel system corrections being made."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] Despite OPM's decision, the appellant's removal appeal was not moot because there was further relief the Board could order regarding the appellant's removal; if the appellant prevailed, the Board would order the agency to cancel the removal. <span class="Italic">See Bullock v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 361 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) (in order to render an action moot, the appellant must obtain all the relief he would have obtained had he prevailed before the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is thus apparent that the appellant withdrew his appeal based on his belief that the agency would afford him at least some of the relief he sought in his appeal. The question then is whether the appellant should be excused for misunderstanding the result of OPM's decision to grant him a disability retirement annuity and the withdrawal of his removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See Zuhlke,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. at 404-05 (where the appellant withdrew his appeal based on his mistaken belief that he could file a grievance instead, the Board reinstated the appeal because his mistaken belief was excusable under the circumstances). Under the particular circumstances of this case, namely, the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, his apparently erroneous belief or misunderstanding regarding the consequences of his withdrawal of his appeal, the lack of a detailed record of what occurred during his telephone conference with the AJ, and the agency's lack of response to the petition for review, we find that his appeal should be reinstated. <span class="Italic">See Amante</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 638; <span class="Italic">Zuhlke</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 405. In <span id="Page_1094"></span>reaching this conclusion, we further find that the appellant exercised due diligence in seeking reopening within several weeks of first learning that the agency did not intend to purge all references to his removal from his OPF and only one day after receiving the agency's decision on the matter. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 660 &#x00B6; 10 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that he was misled by the AJ as to the circumstances of withdrawal of his appeal, he should offer evidence of the misrepresentations. In <span class="Italic">Hazen v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 98, 99 (1984), the appellant asserted that after he withdrew his appeal because of an inability to travel to a distant hearing site, the AJ informed him that a supplemental appropriations bill had passed and that the hearing could be held closer to the appellant's home. The Board declined to reinstate Hazen's appeal; the appellant submitted no evidence to support his allegations and there was "nothing in the record to lend credence to those assertions." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210208105">845 Fed. Appx. 927</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP) (AJ's order adequately informed appellant of the consequences of withdrawal of his VEOA appeal). <span class="Italic">Mayne v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0156-I-1 (NP 12/27/2013), reinstated an appeal when on PFR the appellant provided a statement of his understanding of a conversation with the AJ, the AJ did not record or otherwise memorialize the conference; lacking any way to determine what was really said about withdrawal of the appeal, the Board sent the case back for adjudication. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 94 MSPR 216, 223 &#x00B6; 17 (2003), reinstated the appeal when an AJ correctly advised the appellant that the Board lacked jurisdiction over his appeal. A statutory change restored Board jurisdiction after the appeal was withdrawn. The Board found no fault with the AJ; instead the Board restored the appeal right as a matter of equity, without saying as much. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Page v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 110 MSPR 492, 2009 MSPB 20 (2009) (reinstating an appeal when there were multiple appeals, apparently submitted through e-filing and then joined by the AJ; the appellant wanted to continue with at least one of the appeals and the AJ apparently misunderstood the appellant's intent; the appellant acted quickly to rectify the error).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Misinformation from the AJ is distinct from an improper procedural or substantive ruling. <span class="Italic">Turner v. DHUD</span>, 12 MSPR 46, 47 (1982), declined to allow the appellant to reinstate an appeal he withdrew after the AJ did not allow the appellant to call witnesses of his choice. The appellant should have continued with the appeal and either raised a charge of bias, if appropriate, or contested the exclusionary ruling through a PFR.</p>
