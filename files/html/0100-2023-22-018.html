<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-19"><span class="space">4.</span> Cancelation of Action Appealed</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">To be a prevailing party under the Civil Rights Act and the Freedom of Information Act, if there is no final decision in favor of the complainant, the courts require only that the complainant obtain at least a significant portion of the relief sought in bringing the action, whether through settlement or otherwise. If the respondent grants all or part of the relief sought before a judgment or another order is entered, fees may be awarded if it is determined that relief was granted as a result of the institution of the litigation. Under the Reform Act, applying these principles, an appellant may be deemed a prevailing party if she obtained through settlement within the Board's jurisdiction all or a significant part of the relief sought in petitioning for appeal, regardless of whether a final merits decision was issued. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-116.html#sec2-114">Moot, Withdrawn, and Waived Appeals</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-118.html#sec2-116">Cancelation of Action Appealed</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A more difficult matter--troublesome for represented appellants--is presented when the agency cancels an action before the AJ issues an initial decision. The Board cannot award a fee, even though it may be clear that the cancelation of the action occurred as a result of the appellate process. The Board's approach to fee awards in appeals dismissed when agencies cancel the underlying adverse actions resulted from the Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Bd. v. West Virginia DHHR,</span> <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/532/598.html">121 S. Ct. 1835</a>, 1840-48 (2001), analyzing a fee-shifting statute when litigation led to a change in position but the change in position was not directed by court order or agreed on through a settlement. There must be, the Court held, an adjudicative alteration in the legal relationship of the parties for the fee-shifting statute to be applied. A nonjudicial alteration of circumstances does not support a fee award. Under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the United States, parties are ordinarily required to bear their own attorney's fees-the prevailing party is not entitled to collect from the loser. <span class="Italic">See Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society</span>, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). Under this "American Rule," we follow "a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority." <span class="Italic">Key Tronic Corp. v. United States</span>, 511 U.S. 809, 819 (1994). Congress, however, has authorized the award of attorney's fees to the "prevailing party" in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 259, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(k), the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1975, 89 Stat. 402, 42 U.S.C. 1973l(e), and the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S.C. 1988. <span class="Italic">See generally Marek v. Chesny</span>, 473 U.S. 1, 43-51 (1985) (Appendix to opinion of Brennan, J., dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In designating those parties eligible for an award of litigation costs, Congress employed the term "prevailing party," a legal term of art. Black's Law Dictionary 1145 (7th ed. 1999) defines "prevailing party" as "[a] party in whose favor a judgment is rendered, regardless of the amount of damages awarded.--Also termed <span class="Italic">successful party</span>." This view that a "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court can be distilled from our prior cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hanrahan v. Hampton</span>, 446 U.S. 754, 758 (1980) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>), we reviewed the legislative history of 1988 and found that "Congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims." Our "[r]espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail." <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. Helms</span>, 482 U.S. 755, 760 (1987). We have held that even an award of nominal damages suffices under this test. <span class="Italic">See Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to judgments on the merits, we have held that settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree may serve as the basis for an award of attorney's fees. <span class="Italic">See Maher v. Gagne</span>, 448 U.S. 122 (1980). Although a consent decree does not always include an admission of liability by the defendant, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>., at 126, n.8, it nonetheless is a court-ordered "chang[e] [in] the legal relationship between [the plaintiff] and the defendant." <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist</span>., 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Hewitt, supra</span>, at 760-761, and <span class="Italic">Rhodes v.

These decisions, taken together, establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties" necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees. 489 U.S., at 792-793; <span class="Italic">see also Hanrahan, supra</span>, at 757 ("[I]t seems clearly to have been the intent of Congress to permit...an interlocutory award only to a party who has established his entitlement to some relief on the merits of his claims, either in the <span class="Italic">trial court</span> or <span class="Italic">on appeal</span>" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissenters chide us for upsetting "long-prevailing <span class="Italic">Circuit</span> precedent." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 1 (emphasis added). But, as Justice Scalia points out in his concurrence, several Courts of Appeals have relied upon dicta in our prior cases in approving the "catalyst theory." <span class="Italic">See post</span>, at 11-12; <span class="Italic">see also supra</span>, at 4-5, n.5. Now that the issue is squarely presented, it behooves us to reconcile the plain language of the statutes with our prior <span class="Italic">holdings</span>. We have only awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has received a judgment on the merits, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Farrar, supra</span>, at 112, or obtained a court-ordered consent decree, <span class="Italic">Maher, supra</span>, at 129-130--we have not awarded attorney's fees where the plaintiff has secured the reversal of a directed verdict, <span class="Italic">see Hanrahan, supra</span>, at 759, or acquired a judicial pronouncement that the defendant has violated the Constitution unaccompanied by "<span class="Italic">judicial</span> relief," <span class="Italic">Hewitt, supra</span>, at 760 (emphasis added). Never have we awarded attorney's fees for a nonjudicial "alteration of actual circumstances." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 13. While urging an expansion of our precedents on this front, the dissenters would simultaneously abrogate the "merit" requirement of our prior cases and award attorney's fees where the plaintiff's claim "was at least colorable" and "not...groundless." <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 7 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We cannot agree that the term "prevailing party" authorizes federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reached the "sought-after destination" without obtaining any judicial relief. <span class="Italic">Post</span>, at 13 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners nonetheless argue that the legislative history of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act supports a broad reading of "prevailing party" which includes the "catalyst theory." We doubt that legislative history could overcome what we think is the rather clear meaning of "prevailing party"-the term actually used in the statute. Since we resorted to such history in <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, 489 U.S., at 790, <span class="Italic">Maher</span>, 448 U.S., at 129, and <span class="Italic">Hanrahan</span>, 446 U.S., at 756-757, however, we do likewise here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The House Report to 1988 states that "[t]he phrase 'prevailing party' is not intended to be limited to the victor only after entry of a final judgment following a full trial on the merits, "H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, p. 7 (1976), while the Senate Report explains that "parties may be considered to have prevailed when they vindicate rights through a consent judgment or without formally obtaining relief," S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976). Petitioners argue that these Reports and their reference to a 1970 decision from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, <span class="Italic">Parham v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co</span>., 433 F.2d 421 (1970), indicate Congress' intent to adopt the "catalyst theory." We think the legislative history cited by petitioners is at best ambiguous as to the availability of the "catalyst theory" for awarding attorney's fees. Particularly in view of the "American Rule" that attorney's fees will not be awarded absent "explicit statutory authority," such legislative history is clearly insufficient to alter the accepted meaning of the statutory term. <span class="Italic">Key Tronic</span>, 511 U.S., at 819; <span class="Italic">see also Hanrahan, supra</span>, at 758 ("[O]nly when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims...has there been a determination of the 'substantial rights of the parties,' which Congress determined was a <span id="Page_4551"></span>necessary foundation for departing from the usual rule in this country that each party is to bear the expense of his own attorney" (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-1558, at 8)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners finally assert that the "catalyst theory" is necessary to prevent defendants from unilaterally mooting an action before judgment in an effort to avoid an award of attorney's fees. They also claim that the rejection of the "catalyst theory" will deter plaintiffs with meritorious but expensive cases from bringing suit. We are skeptical of these assertions, which are entirely speculative and unsupported by any empirical evidence (e.g., whether the number of suits brought in the Fourth Circuit has declined, in relation to other Circuits, since the decision in S-1 and S-2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners discount the disincentive that the "catalyst theory" may have upon a defendant's decision to voluntarily change its conduct, conduct that may not be illegal. "The defendants' potential liability for fees in this kind of litigation can be as significant as, and sometimes even more significant than, their potential liability on the merits," <span class="Italic">Evans v. Jeff D</span>., 475 U.S. 717, 734 (1986), and the possibility of being assessed attorney's fees may well deter a defendant from altering its conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">And petitioners' fear of mischievous defendants only materializes in claims for equitable relief, for so long as the plaintiff has a cause of action for damages, a defendant's change in conduct will not moot the case. Even then, it is not clear how often courts will find a case mooted: "It is well settled that a defendant's voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine the legality of the practice" unless it is "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." <span class="Italic">Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc</span>., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). If a case is not found to be moot, and the plaintiff later procures an enforceable judgment, the court may of course award attorney's fees. Given this possibility, a defendant has a strong incentive to enter a settlement agreement, where it can negotiate attorney's fees and costs. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marek v. Chesny</span>, 473 U.S., at 7 ("[M]any a defendant would be unwilling to make a binding settlement offer on terms that left it exposed to liability for attorney's fees in whatever amount the court might fix on motion of the plaintiff" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have also stated that "[a] request for attorney's fees should not result in a second major litigation," <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983), and have accordingly avoided an interpretation of the fee-shifting statutes that would have "spawn[ed] a second litigation of significant dimension," <span class="Italic">Garland</span>, 489 U.S., at 791. Among other things, a "catalyst theory" hearing would require analysis of the defendant's subjective motivations in changing its conduct, an analysis that "will likely depend on a highly factbound inquiry and may turn on reasonable inferences from the nature and timing of the defendant's change in conduct." Brief for United States as <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span> 28. Although we do not doubt the ability of district courts to perform the nuanced "three thresholds" test required by the "catalyst theory"-whether the claim was colorable rather than groundless; whether the lawsuit was a substantial rather than an insubstantial cause of the defendant's change in conduct; whether the defendant's change in conduct was motivated by the plaintiff's threat of victory rather than threat of expense, <span class="Italic">see post</span>, at 6-7--it is clearly not a formula for "ready administrability." <span class="Italic">Burlington v. Dague</span>, 505 U.S. 557, 566 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the clear meaning of "prevailing party" in the fee-shifting statutes, we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut. In <span class="Italic">Alyeska</span>, 421 U.S., at 260, we said that Congress had not "extended any roving authority to the Judiciary to allow counsel fees as costs or otherwise whenever the courts might deem them warranted." To disregard the clear legislative language and the holdings of our prior cases on the basis of such policy arguments would be a similar assumption of a "roving authority." For the reasons stated above, we hold that the "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C. 3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12205.<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sacco v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SACCO_GERALDINE_DC_0752_99_0219_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251118.pdf">90 MSPR 37</a>, 39-42 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Sacco v. DOJ</span>, 317 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003), applied <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> to preclude an award of fees for the appeal of a 1998 constructive suspension that was unilaterally rescinded by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal alleging that the agency constructively suspended her beginning November 1, 1998. The agency subsequently canceled the action and returned the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. After the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal as moot with the agreement of the parties, the appellant filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses totaling $40,155.27. The AJ found that the appellant was constructively suspended, the appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction, attorney fees were incurred, the appellant was the prevailing party, and fees were warranted in the interest of justice. The AJ found that $34,716.27 in attorney fees and expenses was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the AJ should not have awarded fees related to certain claims the appellant made on the merits of her appeal, and that the AJ erred when he awarded fees for alleged duplicate or excessive work performed by two attorneys. However, although we grant the petition for review because we agree that some of the agency arguments are meritorious, we do not further consider these arguments because we find that the appellant was not a prevailing party under the analysis in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home,</span> <span class="Italic">Inc. v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources,</span> 532 U.S. 598, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 149 L. Ed.2d 855 (2001). Consequently, the appellant is not statutorily entitled to an award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The award of attorney fees in this appeal is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), which provides in pertinent part that we "may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board...determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice Prevailing party status is therefore a threshold determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The underlying appeal alleging a constructive suspension was dismissed as moot with the agreement of the parties, prior to any hearing or findings by the AJ concerning the merits of the claim, including the appellant's affirmative defenses. No relief sought by the appellant was effected by any enforceable order, decree, or judgment of the Board. In finding that the appellant was a prevailing party, the AJ relied upon <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 83 MSPR 666 (1999), <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 350 (1998), and <span class="Italic">Roman v. Department of the Army,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 409 (1996). In <span class="Italic">Alexander,</span> the Board stated that "an appellant 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the agency's behavior in a way that directly benefits the appellant." <span class="Italic">Alexander,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. at 353 (citations omitted). However, the appellant in that case was awarded attorney fees following the entry of a settlement into the record for enforcement purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Roman</span> we stated that an appellant "may be deemed a 'prevailing party'...if all or a significant portion of the relief sought...was obtained as a result of the filing of the petition." <span class="Italic">Roman</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 419-20. Nevertheless, in <span class="Italic">Roman</span> the award of fees in an addendum proceeding was predicated upon a preceding decision on the merits of the appellant's whistleblower appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 411.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously considered the meaning of "prevailing party" with respect to attorney fee awards. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hodnick v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Mediation &#x0026; Conciliation Service,</span> 4 MSPB 431, 4 M.S.P.R. 371, 375 (1980). Our more recent interpretation of the requirements of "prevailing party" followed from <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby,</span> 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992). <span class="Italic">See Ray v. Department of Health &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Human Services,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 100, 105 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruling in part</span> <span class="Italic">Hodnick.</span> The Board's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> required that to be deemed a prevailing party, an appellant must have obtained as a result of the initiation of a Board appeal "at an absolute minimum, 'actual relief on 'the merits of [the] claim' which 'affects the behavior of the defendant towards the plaintiff."' <span class="Italic">Joyce v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 112, 118 (1997), <span class="Italic">quoting Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 116, 113 S. Ct. 566. Thus, we found that where, after the initiation of the Board appeal, the agency unilaterally rescinded its action, the appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction and incurred attorney fees, a rebuttable presumption in favor of attorney fees arose<span class="Italic">. Joyce</span> at 118.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again relying upon <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Board rejected the objection to an award of attorney fees based on the absence of an enforceable judgment, or comparable enforceable relief afforded through a consent decree or settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. at 675-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23. We explicitly applied the "catalyst" theory concerning the award of attorney fees to a prevailing party, "i.e., if a respondent grants all or part of the relief sought before a judgment or other order is entered, attorney fees may be awarded if that relief was granted as a result of the institution of the action....<span class="Italic">" Id.</span> at &#x00B6; 23. Noting that almost every federal Circuit Court of Appeals endorsed the "catalyst" theory and that the U.S. Supreme Court had not clearly rejected it, <span class="Italic">id</span>., we therefore concluded that where the agency unilaterally rescinded its action prior to any findings on the merits, the appellant could attain prevailing party status upon establishing only a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under <span class="Italic">Joyce</span>, there was no requirement that an appeal result in any enforceable order, judgment, consent decree, or settlement agreement entered into the record to support a award of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court rejected the "catalyst" theory in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon.</span> Looking to the plain language of the attorney fee provisions at issue and noting that Black's Law dictionary defined "prevailing party" in terms of one who secures a judgment, the Court held that the theory</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">allows an award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties....&#8197;A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change....&#8197;We cannot agree that the term "prevailing party" <span id="Page_4552"></span>authorizes federal courts to award attorney's fees to a plaintiff who, by simply filing a nonfrivolous but nonetheless potentially meritless lawsuit (it will never be determined), has reached the "sought-after destination" without obtaining any judicial relief....&#8197;[Prior Supreme Court cases] establish that enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties" necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees....&#8197;[W]e hold that the "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney's fees, under the FHAA, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3613(c)(2), and ADA, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Buckhannon,</span> 121 S. Ct. at 1840-41, 1842. The Court further noted that while private settlements alone would not support an award of attorney fees, settlements entered into the record and made subject to enforcement clearly could do so, in addition to consent decrees, judgments, or other legal findings, on the merits supporting legal liability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1840 n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accord with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, we discern no basis to employ a different meaning in the use of the term "prevailing party" in the statute governing the attorney fee award in this appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Buckhannon</span>, 121 S. Ct. at 1845 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasizing the many federal statutes employing the term "prevailing party" to establish an entitlement to attorney fees, noting the uniformity of the plain meaning of the term throughout such statutes, specifically its identical use in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(g)(2) and (3), and in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A)). To the extent that <span class="Italic">Joyce</span> and other Board decisions conflict with the Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, they are overruled. <span class="Italic">See Joyce,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal was dismissed as moot. The agency's unilateral rescission of the alleged adverse action resulted in no consent decree, judgment, order, or settlement agreement by which the Board could enforce any relief arising from the appeal or through the agency's action. We therefore find that the appellant was not a prevailing party in this appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), and that there is no basis upon which to award attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another iteration of the appeal, <span class="Italic">Sacco v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After the issuance of the addendum initial decision, the Supreme Court of the United States issued <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia,</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Resources,</span> 532 U.S. 598, 121 S. Ct. 1835, 149 L. Ed. 2d 855 (2001), which clarifies the meaning of the term "prevailing party."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant must show that she is the "prevailing party" to establish her entitlement to an award of attorney fees in a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). The administrative judge in this appeal applied the "catalyst theory" of recovery to determine whether the appellant was the prevailing party. Under the catalyst theory, an appellant may be the prevailing party when, after the filing of an appeal, the agency voluntarily grants the relief sought, the administrative judge dismisses the appeal as moot, and the relief is causally related to the initiation of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Nichols v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 554 &#x00B6; 6 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon,</span> 121 S. Ct. at 1840-43, ruled that the catalyst theory is not a permissible basis upon which to award attorney fees because it allows an award where, even though a lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in one party's conduct, there is no judicially-sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. The Court held that a "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court or who has gained a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1842-43. The Court found that "enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties' necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1840 (citation omitted). The Board has found no basis to employ a different meaning to the term "prevailing party" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g), the statute governing attorney fee awards in this appeal, than the meaning given the term by the Court. <span class="Italic">Sacco v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously set forth, the administrative judge dismissed this appeal as moot. That decision became final. The agency's unilateral rescission of the alleged adverse action resulted in no consent decree, judgment, order, or settlement agreement by which the Board could enforce any relief arising from the appeal or through the agency's action. We therefore find that the appellant is not the prevailing party in this appeal, and that there is no basis upon which to award her attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Sacco</span> &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Nichols</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sacco</span> was affirmed by the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Sacco v. DOJ</span>, 317 F.3d 1384, 1385-87 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sacco was employed as a Special Agent with the Drug Enforcement Agency ("DEA"). In August of 1998, she was placed on administrative leave pending completion of psychiatric and pharmacological therapy, and a follow-up suitability review examination. The following month, DEA informed Sacco that she would not be permitted to return to work unless she agreed to undergo several months of treatment for her medical condition. After the expiration of her administrative leave, Sacco began using accumulated annual and sick leave to cover the remaining period of her absence. She exhausted her annual and sick leave on December 27, 1998, and thereafter was absent without leave. In January of 1999, she filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board arguing that she had been constructively suspended. In February of 1999, DEA removed Sacco from absent without leave status, placed her on administrative leave retroactively, and advised her that she would remain on administrative leave until further notification. Several days later, DEA notified Sacco that it was proposing to indefinitely suspend her because of her unavailability to work for medical reasons, and that she would remain on administrative leave until it had reached a decision regarding her proposed suspension. Effective March 22, 1999, DEA indefinitely suspended her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ("AJ") convened a telephonic status conference, and advised the parties of his preliminary conclusion that Sacco had been constructively suspended. Shortly thereafter, DEA restored her annual and sick leave from November 1 to December 27, 1998, cancelled her absent without leave status, and placed her on administrative leave retroactive to December 27, 1998. In a May 14, 1999, initial decision, the AJ dismissed the appeal as moot because the record established that DEA had completely rescinded the alleged constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In November of 1999, Sacco submitted medical documentation concerning her fitness for duty and underwent an evaluation pursuant to DEA's suitability review protocol. She later filed a second appeal with the board alleging that she was constructively suspended when the DEA failed to terminate her indefinite suspension after she submitted evidence of her fitness for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February of 2000, DEA determined that there was no longer a basis for indefinite suspension, and placed Sacco on non-duty status with pay retroactive to the date she initially filed the necessary medical documentation. In response to this action, Sacco withdrew her disability discrimination and constructive suspension claims, and requested dismissal of her appeal. Accordingly, the AJ dismissed the appeal as moot. Sacco petitioned for and was awarded attorney fees and expenses for her first appeal. On review, the board reversed the award in light of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sacco then filed a petition for attorney fees for claims presented in her second appeal to the board. The AJ denied the request because she failed to establish that the relief obtained was causally related to the filing of an appeal with the board. The board denied Sacco's petition for review, reopened the appeal on its own motion, and denied her request for attorney fees because she did not qualify as a "prevailing party" under federal fee-shifting statutes as established by <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. Sacco timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sacco advances three arguments: (1) <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> does not apply to the board's fee-shifting statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); (2) the AJ's preliminary conclusion and finding, as reflected in the March 24, 1999, Order and Summary, was a sufficient judicial imprimatur to elevate her to prevailing party status; and (3) substantial deference should be accorded to the board's <span class="Italic">pre-Buckhannon</span> interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (g), which recognized the applicability of the catalyst theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After submission of the opening brief, this court decided <span class="Italic">Brickwood Contractors</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), Sacco argues that we should give substantial deference to past board decisions that used the catalyst theory to determine the prevailing party in a request for attorney fees pursuant to its fee-shifting statute. The government responds that although Congress may statutorily delegate authority to an agency to make specific policy <span id="Page_4553"></span>determinations and courts must give agency decisions deference if the statute is ambiguous and the agency interpretation is reasonable, it does not preclude agencies from changing their policy determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A sudden and unexplained change of an agency interpretation of a statute may be vulnerable upon judicial review if it is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute. <span class="Italic">Smiley v. Citibank (S.D.). N.A.</span>, 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996). However, if the agency is able to provide a reasonable justification for its change of policy, a reviewing court should uphold the agency's decision<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Here, the board changed its interpretation of "prevailing party" in its fee-shifting statute based on the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, which rejected the use of the "catalyst theory" in construing whether one is a "prevailing party" under fee-shifting provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Court held that the term "prevailing party" authorizes an award of attorney's fees when it is accompanied by a corresponding "alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." 532 U.S. at 605. In view of this requirement, <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> is a reasonable justification for the board to adopt a new interpretation of a "prevailing party." <span class="Italic">See Maislin Indus., Inc</span>. <span class="Italic">v.

Thus, the board properly denied Sacco's motion for attorney fees because its new interpretation of "prevailing party" was consistent with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The fee claim involved in <span class="Italic">Sacco</span> was reinitiated in the Court of Federal Claims through a suit brought under the Back Pay Act.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether a party is a "prevailing party," Board law has followed the "catalyst theory." <span class="Italic">Joyce v.

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 100, 105 n.17 (1994), that an appellant may be a prevailing party where, after the filing of an appeal, the agency voluntarily granted the relief sought, the AJ dismissed the appeal as moot, and the relief was causally related to the initiation of the appeal in the absence of a Board final decision. This principle is generally known as the catalyst theory of recovery. <span class="Italic">Joyce II,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 666 &#x00B6; 23. In <span class="Italic">Joyce II,</span> the Board addressed the discrepancy between the requirement in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> and the catalyst theory and found that almost all of the circuit courts that have addressed the issue have found that their versions of the catalyst theory survive <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>. The Board stated that, in the absence of a decision by the Federal Circuit addressing this particular issue, it would continue to follow the catalyst theory of recovery. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the split among the circuits, however, the Supreme Court granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span> in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> to address this particular issue. The Court has now defined what is necessary in order to qualify as a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the Court ruled that the "catalyst theory" is not a permissible basis upon which to award attorney fees because it allows an award where, even though a lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in one party's conduct, there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties' legal relationship. <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 121 S. Ct. at 1840-43. The Court held that a "prevailing party" is one who has been awarded some relief by the court or who has gained a settlement agreement enforced through a consent decree. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1842-43. The Court found that, "enforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1840, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,</span> 489 U.S. 782, 792-93, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 103 L. Ed.2d 866 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> held, specifically, that the catalyst theory is not a permissible basis for an award under the Fair Housing Amendments Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), neither of which is at issue here. We award fees in an adverse action appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)-(2). Nonetheless, the Court stated that the term "prevailing party" is "a legal term of art," which Congress used in numerous statutes that address a variety of subjects. It went on to analyze the issue by examining several of those areas and its discussion is clear that, at least in the absence of some unstated reason for differentiation, its holding is applicable to the broad range of statutes that award fees to a "prevailing party."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Court cited to not just the ADA, but the Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Attorney Fees Awards Act in its discussion of the meaning of prevailing party. Each of those statutes is relevant to our fee awards under section 7701(g)(2) and, in <span class="Italic">Hodnick</span>, we specifically discussed the latter two, as well as several of the cases interpreted in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> in reaching our determination of the meaning of "prevailing party." Thus, having considered much of the same authority that the Board did, the Court reached the opposite result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in <span class="Italic">Hodnick</span>, the Board had noted that the legislative history of section 7701(g)(2) showed that it was intent of Congress "to provide appellants with the same reimbursement of fees in administrative proceedings as would be available in civil proceedings." <span class="Italic">Hodnick</span>, 4 MSPB 431, 4 M.S.P.R. at 374. Since now, under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the law is clear that an individual cannot be awarded fees in a civil proceeding under the catalyst theory, it would be contrary to the legislative history and congressional intent to allow fees on that theory under section 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recently considered for the first time the effect of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon's</span> analysis of the requirements for "prevailing party" status as it affects the award of attorney fees under the authority of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Department of Justice,</span> M.S.P.B. 2001 WL 1090251, Docket No. DC-0752-0219-A-1 (September 4, 2001). In <span class="Italic">Sacco,</span> we found no ground for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> or finding its holding inapplicable to fee awards under &#x00A7; 7701. Therefore, the Board's line of decisions applying the "catalyst theory" (e.g., <span class="Italic">Joyce II,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 666 &#x00B6; 23) were overruled to the extent they were in conflict with <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we apply the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> to determine whether the appellant here qualifies as a "prevailing party." As stated above, before the completion of the hearing, the agency fully rescinded the 30-day suspension taken against the appellant, and the AJ issued a decision dismissing the appeal as moot, without a decision on the merits. The initial decision became final on November 10, 1999. Under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the agency's voluntary change in conduct, i.e., the rescission of the 30-day suspension action, although accomplishing what the appellant sought to receive by filing an appeal with the Board, lacks the necessary "judicial imprimatur," i.e., an "enforceable judgment on the merits" or "court-ordered consent decree," to create the requisite "material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties." <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 121 S. Ct. <span id="Page_4554"></span>at 1840. Thus, there is no basis upon which to find that the appellant is a prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Danbury v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-10-0328-A-1 (NP 10/3/2012), denied prevailing party status to an appellant based on success at various intermediate stages before the appeal was dismissed as moot:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the petition for review, the appellant challenges the initial decision denying his motion for attorney fees. The appellant argues that a March 2, 2011 "Notice and Order" issued by the administrative judge constituted an enforceable judgment on the merits that materially altered the parties' legal relationship, awarded him some relief, and was a substantive determination that resulted in him receiving monies. The appellant asserts that a prevailing party is determined by looking at the case as a whole, rather than solely at the final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thoroughly addressed these issues in the initial decision, and we discern no reason to disturb those well-reasoned findings. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 106 (1997) (stating that there is no reason to disturb the initial decision when the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions); <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (same). Whether a party may be deemed a prevailing party depends on the relief ordered in the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9 (2011); <span class="Italic">Baldwin v.

Preliminary conclusions, such as those set forth in an administrative judge's Order and Summary, neither establish judicial imprimatur nor constitute a court-ordered change in the legal relationship of the parties to permit an award. <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Department of Justice,</span> 317 F.3d 1384, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's contention, there is no final decision of the Board on the merits that awards him any relief and materially changes the legal relationship of the parties. Rather, the initial decision, which became the Board's final decision when neither party petitioned for review, merely dismissed the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (an appellant whose removal appeal is dismissed as moot is not a "prevailing party" eligible for an award of attorney fees). The appellant has not identified any Board or court precedent that entitles him to prevailing party status under the facts of this case. To the extent that the appellant is relying upon a "catalyst" theory of establishing that he is a prevailing party, because his appeal resulted in him receiving monies representing 26 days in question, the Board and its reviewing court have rejected that theory. <span class="Italic">See Sacco,</span> 371 F.3d at 1386-87; <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Department of Justice,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant, citing <span class="Italic">Driscoll,</span> contends that a prevailing party is determined by looking at the case as a whole, rather than solely at the final decision, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Driscoll,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9, that an appellant is, or is not, a prevailing party in the case "as a whole" in order to explain that there can be, by definition, only one prevailing party, regardless of whether an appellant wins on one motion or phase of an appeal while the agency wins on another. The Board held that, contrary to the implication in some prior decisions, the Board does not determine prevailing party status on a "line-item basis," such as determining whether an appellant is a prevailing party with respect to an initial decision but not with respect to a cross-petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board did not suggest in <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span> that a preliminary conclusion by an administrative judge establishes judicial imprimatur and constitutes a Board-ordered enforceable change in the legal relationship of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that an "order" is, by definition, enforceable. A party may, however, only petition the Board for enforcement of "a final decision or order" issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). The March 2, 2011 "Notice and Order," issued before the initial decision dismissing this appeal as moot, was not an enforceable "final decision or order."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning preliminary orders not qualifying for fee shifting, a Board order remanding for a determination of whether a canceled appeal was truly moot, and an AJ's order to an agency directing it to clarify whether it paid interest on back pay, did not constitute the Board final order necessary to establish prevailing party status through an order directing a change to the appellant's benefit, <span class="Italic">Holsey v. DOJ</span>, AT-0752-13-0060-A-1 (NP 12/2/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if the administrative judge's finding that it did not appear that the agency had paid the appellant the interest owed to him could be construed as a preliminary conclusion that the agency had failed to pay the appellant that interest, such a conclusion would not entitle him to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Sacco v. Department of Justice</span>, 317 F.3d 1384, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (preliminary conclusions, such as those set forth in an administrative judge's Order and Summary, neither establish judicial imprimatur nor constitute a court-ordered change in the legal relationship of the parties so as to permit an attorney fees award).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is, or is not, a prevailing party in the case as a whole, and whether he may be deemed a prevailing party depends on the relief ordered in the Board's final decision. <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9. In this case, there is no final decision of the Board on the merits that awards the appellant any relief and materially changes the legal relationship of the parties. The Board's October 29, 2013 remand order is not a final decision and did not result in a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties. The April 15, 2014 remand initial decision, which became the Board's final decision when neither party petitioned for review, merely dismissed the appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (an appellant whose removal appeal is dismissed as moot is not a "prevailing party" eligible for attorney fees)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sanchez v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 183, 185-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13, 2010 MSPB 177 (2010), involved a convoluted set of facts. The appellant was removed for off duty misconduct, appealed, and settled through an agreement that provided for his reinstatement and placement on LWOP for a period of time. That settlement was entered into the Board's record for enforcement purposes. The agency later removed the appellant for a new misconduct charge, the appellant appealed and filed a petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement that resolved the first removal appeal. The appeal of the second discharge was placed on hold through a DWOP while the parties litigated the enforcement petition involving the settlement. The Board determined the agency breached the settlement and the Board directed that it cancel the second removal and reinstate the appellant on LWOP. The appellant reinstated the second removal appeal, but the AJ dismissed it as moot because the appellant received, through the enforcement action, all the relief he could have had he successfully appealed the second removal appeal. The appellant filed a fee petition for work on the second removal appeal. The Board declined to order payment of fees; there was no change of position by the agency based on action by the Board on the second removal appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal underlying this request for attorney fees as moot. That initial decision became the final decision of the Board on June 30, 2009, when neither party filed a petition for review by that date. It is by now well settled that the dismissal of an appeal as moot amounts to a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Haskins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2007), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 267 Fed. Appx. 934 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Where an appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the Board is without the authority to order any relief and no order exists for it to enforce. <span class="Italic">See Antonio v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 12 (2008); <span class="Italic">Haskins</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17. Thus, the appellant did not receive any relief in this case and he is not a prevailing party in this case. Because the appellant has not established that he is a prevailing party in this case, he is not entitled to an award of attorney fees in this case. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Wightman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 109, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). To the extent that the appellant could be entitled to any attorney fees, it can only be as a result of the relief he obtained in his petition for enforcement, and he must request fees in connection with that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his success in his petition for enforcement renders him a prevailing party in this case because this case is inextricably intertwined with his petition for enforcement. In effect, the appellant asserts a modified catalyst theory under which he obtains prevailing party status in this case if the agency has involuntarily rescinded its action in this case as a result of a Board order entered in a separate case that involves the same agency action. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board &#x0026; Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), the Court noted that prevailing parties are not generally entitled to collect attorney fees from the losing party and courts will not award fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority. 532 U.S. at 602. The Board has the authority to award attorney fees in adverse action cases pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). To establish entitlement to an award of attorney fees, an appellant must show that: (1) He is the prevailing party; (2) he incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship; (3) an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the amount of fees claimed is reasonable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Wightman v.

An appellant who shows that he obtained a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties through <span id="Page_4555"></span>an enforceable final judgment on the merits or a settlement agreement entered into the record for the purposes of enforcement by the Board is a "prevailing party" for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Sacco v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that he is a prevailing party in this case because he received "relief" in this case as a result of the Board's order in the compliance case is unavailing. Quite simply, his appeal was dismissed as moot, and there is nothing that the Board can enforce. Thus, nothing that happened in the adjudication of this appeal resulted in a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties. <span class="Italic">See McKenna</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 2 (prevailing party status requires an enforceable judgment resulting in a material alteration of the legal relationship between the parties) (quoting <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the appellant's argument, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17 (2008), does not support his position. In <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the Board found that a party may establish prevailing party status in a compliance action without obtaining an enforceable order or consent decree in the compliance proceeding "so long as the relief the party achieves carries with it sufficient judicial or, in this case, Board imprimatur." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15. The Board's oversight of the parties' compliance with a final Board order or an enforceable settlement agreement provides sufficient Board imprimatur to allow a party to qualify as a prevailing party under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) in the compliance matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17. However, neither the Board nor its reviewing court has held that a party may use a favorable order in a separate case to establish prevailing party status in a case that has been dismissed as moot. <span class="Italic">See also Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center v. United States Bureau of Land Management</span>, 589 F.3d 1027, 1033-35 (9th Cir. 2009) (finding that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party in a case dismissed as moot where the agency had involuntarily rescinded its action as a result of an unfavorable court decision in a separate case involving the same parties and the same type of agency action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the appellant is not a prevailing party in this appeal and he is not entitled to an award of attorney fees. In light of our disposition in this case, we need not address whether an award of fees is precluded by the earlier settlement agreement, and we need not discuss the parties' remaining arguments concerning the merits of the attorney fees request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> precluded fees in an appeal from an OPM determination when OPM rescinded its decision (and the appellant apparently received the annuity adjustment he desired) without a Board order requiring OPM to act, <span class="Italic">Hurst v. OPM,</span> DC-0831-09-0849-A-1 (NP 11/12/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenged the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)'s decision as to the amount of retroactive disability retirement benefits to which he was entitled, arguing that they should have begun to accrue on an earlier date. During adjudication, based on the appellant's employing agency's correction of his last day in pay status, OPM rescinded its final decision. Based on that rescission, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The initial decision became the Board's final decision when neither party filed a petition for review. The appellant then filed a motion for attorney fees incurred in connection with his appeal. The administrative judge denied the motion, finding that the appellant was not a prevailing party under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598, 604-10 (2001) because his underlying appeal was dismissed following OPM's rescission of the action appealed. The administrative judge reasoned that OPM's rescission constituted a voluntary change in conduct that, while it accomplished what the appellant sought to achieve by filing an appeal with the Board, lacked the necessary judicial imprimatur of an enforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58 (2008), supports his position because it provides that a party may achieve "prevailing party" status for the purposes of qualifying for an award of attorney fees without obtaining an enforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree so long as the relief achieved carries with it sufficient judicial imprimatur. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 15. In <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the appellant sought to be reimbursed for attorney fees incurred in the enforcement phase of his appeal. The Board found that the appellant was not foreclosed from an attorney fees award under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> simply because the administrative judge had not issued an enforceable judgment during the enforcement phase. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10. In so finding, the Board considered that administrative judges, in adjudicating petitions for enforcement, have the authority to oversee the parties' compliance efforts, to determine whether they are acting in compliance with either the Board's final order on the merits or the parties' Board-approved settlement agreement, and to issue a compliance decision recommending that the Board find a party in noncompliance, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183, and that the Board has express authority to order corrective action in a case where it determines that one of the parties has failed to comply with a Board order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17. The Board concluded that its oversight of the parties' compliance efforts provides the petition for enforcement process with sufficient Board imprimatur to allow an appellant to qualify as a "prevailing party" even in the absence of a Board order finding the agency in noncompliance or an agreement executed by the parties to settle compliance matters. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Mynard</span>, the appellant argues that, because OPM initially refused to properly calculate his back annuity payments, he was forced to file a Board appeal to ensure compliance with the original dismissal order. We agree with the administrative judge that <span class="Italic">Mynard</span> is inapposite because the appellant in this case did not file a petition for enforcement and the Board did not issue any enforceable order. Although the appellant suggests that the nature of this case is "similar" to that of a petition for enforcement, the fact remains that the Board has not issued any order to be enforced. It is the Board's authority to enforce its orders that gives the required imprimatur to an appellant's reasonable enforcement efforts. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 17. The instant appeal does not implicate the Board's compliance authority and our holding in <span class="Italic">Mynard</span> does not support holding otherwise.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">When an agency canceled an action, but the AJ went on to adjudicate an EEO claim, found no EEO violation but also found improper the underlying adverse action--an indefinite suspension--the appellant was not a prevailing party after the Board, on the agency's PFR, vacated the portion of the initial decision setting aside the suspension, with the effect that the Board final order directed no change in position of the parties. <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-10-1029-A-1 (NP 1/30/2013).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A statute that modified <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> as to FOIA suits did not impact application of the Supreme Court decision in Board litigation, <span class="Italic">Scoggins v. OPM,</span> SF-844E-11-0191-A-1 (NP 8/3/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that the administrative judge did not address the OPEN Government Act of 2007, which she claims modified <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and provides that a complainant has substantially prevailed in a suit filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) if relief has been obtained through a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency. This argument is unavailing. The provisions of that Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(a)(4)(E), apply to FOIA suits. The appellant has not shown that Congress intended the OPEN Government Act of 2007 to apply to cases arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). In fact, the OPEN Government Act of 2007 shows that Congress knew how to alter the rule in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> when it wished to do so, but presumably did not intend to do so in the context of Board appeals such as this one. <span class="Italic">Cf. Elgin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-45.pdf">132 S. Ct. 2126</a>, 2134-35 (2012) (finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(2) demonstrated that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums for judicial review based on the nature of an employee's claim; that Congress declined to include an exemption from Federal Circuit review for challenges to a statute's constitutionality indicates that Congress intended no such exception).</p>
