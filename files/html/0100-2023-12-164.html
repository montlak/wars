<p class="Body-Text">The "proof of mailing" cases arise when the PFR is mailed to and received by the Board; the question is when it was placed in the mails. What if the petition is mailed but never reaches the Board?</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a claim by appellant or counsel that a PFR was actually timely mailed, although it never reached the Board, the party who mailed the petition should submit an affidavit or sworn statement under penalty of perjury stating that he did file his PFR in a timely fashion. <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 181, 182 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Stromfeld v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 240, 241 (1984)). A general statement, without more, that a PFR was lost in the mail is not sufficient to show timeliness. <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 70, 72 (1993) ("In the absence of any statement from the appellant as to the specific date on which he ostensibly filed his petition for review, or any other evidence tending to show that he timely filed his initial petition, we find that he has not made such a showing."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 163, 164 (1995) ("[T]he appellant has provided no evidence other than his representative's bare statement that he timely filed his petition for review on June 3, 1994.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The sworn statement concerning mailing of the PFR should include specifics concerning date and manner of mailing. With a sufficiently specific explanation concerning mailing, even if the pleading does not reach the Board it is considered timely filed when mailed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Corum v. USPS</span>, 118 MSPR 288, 293 &#x00B6; 11, 2012 MSPB 81 (2012) ("When a party shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, the Board will treat the pleading as filed on the date it was placed in the Postal Service mail stream, regardless of whether the Board receives it. <span class="Italic">Freeze v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 149, 152 (1994). However, the party must present specific details concerning the mailing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">Freeze v. VA</span>, 65 MSPR 149, 152 (1994) ("the party must present specific details concerning the mailing.... Although the sworn statement relates that the petition was addressed to the Board, it gives no specifics concerning the mailing of the petition").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 the Board overruled a decisional line that the presumption of proper mailing does not apply if the mail not get through to the Board, <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 201-03 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A pleading submitted by mail is generally considered filed on the postmark date. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(l). In <span class="Italic">Raphel v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 614 (1991), however, we found that a paper is mailed when it has been placed in an envelope addressed to the last known address of a party and deposited in a United States Post Office or post office box. Thus, we concluded that the date that a pleading is actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream constitutes the filing date. We further stated that we would henceforth allow parties to submit credible evidence--in the form of an affidavit or sworn statement--to establish that, despite a postmark date that appeared to indicate untimely filing, the pleading was actually placed in the mail stream before the deadline passed, and thus was timely filed. 50 MSPR at 618.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kelly v.</span> <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 268, 270 n.2 (1993), we held that the <span class="Italic">Raphel</span> rule applies only to pleadings that are received by the Board. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Kelly</span>, a pleading addressed to the Board and placed in the mail stream on or before the deadline date for filing is not considered timely filed--indeed, it is not considered filed at all--if it is not received by the Board. <span id="Page_1744"></span>We took a similar approach in <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 128 (1992), <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 634, 638 n.4 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Carroll v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 47, 6 MSPR 41 (1981); in all of those cases, we did not consider a pleading that had been mailed to the Board within the filing period, but not received, to have been timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we have also recognized that, as a general matter, evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addressee in due course of the mails<span class="Italic">. See Stracquatanio v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 529, 532 (1992); <span class="Italic">Pfaff v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, 25 MSPR 633, 637 (1985). This presumption is virtually universally recognized by state and federal courts, and is applied in many contexts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31A C.J.S. Evidence &#x00A7; 136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We noted in <span class="Italic">Kelly</span> that we had not hitherto applied the presumption of receipt in due course of the mails to pleadings mailed to the Board. 57 MSPR at 270 n.2. This exception to the general rule generates semantic confusion, however. In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 326, 327 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 5 F.3d 1505 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), and <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 376, 378-79 (1992), for example, the terms "mailing" and "filing" are used interchangeably. Under <span class="Italic">Kelly, Rivers, McKenzie</span>, and <span class="Italic">Carroll</span> by contrast, "filing" requires mailing <span class="Italic">and</span> receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to resolve any confusion on the part of parties who appear before the Board, and in order to adopt what we believe, upon reflection, is the better rule, we hereby OVERRULE <span class="Italic">Kelly v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 268 (1993), <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 128 (1992), <span class="Italic">McKenzie v. EEOC</span>, 42 MSPR 634 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Carroll v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 47, 6 MSPR 41 (1981). Henceforth, when a party shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, it will be treated as filed on the date it was placed in the Postal Service mail stream, regardless of whether the Board receives it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant's mere assertion that he prepared an "appeal for Board review" on November 22, 1992, and mailed it on November 23, 1992, without any specific details concerning such mailing, falls far short of the nature and quality of evidence generally required to establish proof that the petition for review, properly addressed to the Board, was timely placed in the mail stream<span class="Italic">. See Taggio v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 56 MSPR 31, 32 (1992) (where the filer's affidavit stated that the petition for review had been deposited "either at the Post Office or at the Post Office collection box on September 9, 1992," the Board held that this constituted specific and plausible evidence that the petition for review had been placed in the U.S. Postal Service mail stream on time); <span class="Italic">Swinarski v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 513 (1992) (the Board held that an appellant's sworn statement that he had timely mailed his submission from the Pacifica Grove, California post office, in a plain white letter sized envelope properly addressed to the Board, was sufficient to show that he had actually placed his pleading in the Postal Service mail stream in a timely manner); <span class="Italic">Nicoletti v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 610 (1992) (a representative's legal secretary's affidavit representing that she had placed the submission in the mail box on the last day for filing was sufficient to establish that fact); <span class="Italic">Morey v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 22 (1991) (an affidavit was found sufficient because the representative stated that he had placed the petition in a collection box at the Main Post Office, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at approximately 9:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> on Friday, February 10, 1989, and the information on the box stated that the mail was collected every half hour).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, an affidavit does not present specific, credible evidence that a pleading was actually placed in the mail stream, it follows that there is no basis for finding that the pleading was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See Hudgies v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 311 (1992) (a vague, general statement, although sworn, that does not specifically refer to actual mailing on a particular date, is not sufficient to establish that a party's representative actually mailed a pleading before the filing deadline passed); <span class="Italic">accord Robinson v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 325, 327 (1993); <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 376, 378-79 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and his attorney assert that they had received an acknowledgment from the agency but not from the Board, and that they did not question "this state of affairs" because they assumed that all mailings and documents had been received. Also, they aver that it is not unusual for mail to be misplaced or lost in the holiday season, and that there had been a major reorganization of the Postal Service. These vague assertions, which do not address with specificity when and where the petition was mailed, and how it was addressed, do not establish that the appellant mailed a petition for review addressed to the Board on or before the filing deadline.</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 93 MSPR 58, 60 &#x00B6; 5 (2002) ("[W]hen a party shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed in the Postal Service mail stream, it will be treated as filed on the date it was placed in the Postal Service mail stream, regardless of whether the Board receives it."); <span class="Italic">Milner v. DOJ</span>, 77 MSPR 37, 41 n.2 (1997) (PFR was accepted when the agency did not dispute receipt of the service copy of the PFR mailed by counsel to the agency at the same time that the PFR was mailed to the MSPB); <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 420, 422 (1996) (considering the circumstances of mailing a PFR, including receipt by the agency of the pleading, and accepts appellant's somewhat belated assertions that the PFR he sent to the Board was lost in the mails; the Board declined to default the appellant because he failed to respond to the Board's first order to show cause for his apparently untimely PFR); <span class="Italic">Price v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 513, 514 n.* (1985) (probative of a claim that the PFR was lost in mails and that the agency responded to the PFR without objection to its timeliness); <span class="Italic">Lunkin v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 220, 222 n.1 (1984) (accepting the agency's evidence that its PFR was lost in the mails; the other parties timely received their copies). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. USPS</span>, 83 MSPR 500, 503-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (1999) (not crediting an uncorroborated claim that the PFR was filed when no copy was produced and the Board had no record of its receipt; the Board declined to accept as proof of mailing documents constituting the appellant's unsworn statements pertaining to the PFR's mailing when the Board did not receive submissions and the appellant did not allege or prove that the submissions were placed in the "Postal Service mail stream with postage prepaid."); <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 78 MSPR 246, 248-49 (1998) ("inherently incredible" were the appellant's sworn explanations concerning an allegedly undelivered PFR; the appellant offered no documentary support for an assertedly timely mailing; the agency noted that it was not served with a copy of the PFR when it was allegedly filed); <span class="Italic">Dela Cruz v. OPM</span>, 77 MSPR 311, 313 (1998) (discounting the claimed mailing of a PFR by registered mail; the Board had no record of its receipt; the appellant failed to provide a registered mail receipt to support his assertion); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Almond v. FAA</span>, 12 MSPR 670, 671 (1982) (Board checks its records and declines to credit an allegation that the PFR was mistakenly filed in a companion case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In earlier cases, instead of concerning itself with proof of mailing, the Board tended to examine the diligence of the party whose petition never made it to the Board. In <span class="Italic">Kelly v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 268, 261 (1993), <span class="Italic">overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 202 (1994), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board placed on the filing party the burden of either demonstrating timely mailing or, if the mail did not get through, the burden of demonstrating reasonable and timely efforts to correct the situation. <span class="Italic">Gamalog v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 315, 317 (1995), explained <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> to overrule prior Board decisions that a submission is not considered "filed" unless the Board receives it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board changed its approach toward mailings made and not received, the Board still expects that the affidavit or sworn declaration explaining the circumstances of the mailing will be cogent, in the proper form, and made on the basis of personal knowledge. 5 CFR 1201.114(g) (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz-Bonilla v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 137 (1995) (explanation of an untimely filing of a PFR must contain specific evidence of when the submission was filed; the mere assertion that pleading was prepared and mailed in timely fashion without any specific details concerning mailing is insufficient to show that pleading was timely filed); <span class="Italic">Freeze v. VA</span>, 65 MSPR 149, 152 (1994) (explanation concerning the mailing of the PFR was too vague and general to show that the PFR was actually mailed before the filing deadline; a sworn statement gave no specifics concerning the mailing of the petition); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 462, 464 (1994) (in situations involving the timeliness of a filing of a pleading, the Board does not utilize a presumption of delivery of the letter properly addressed and deposited in the mails with the postage prepaid; instead, the Board considers whether the party has shown good cause for the delay between the time it allegedly filed the pleading and the time it submitted a copy of the pleading), <span class="Italic">reconsidered</span>, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 142, 144 (1994) (reconsidered as a result of the <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> decision; the Board still dismissed the <span class="Italic">Ramos</span> PFR because it decided that the evidence of mailing the PFR supplied by the appellant demonstrated "inconsistencies...[that] render doubtful his assertion that he refiled the petition for review in a timely manner" and that the appellant waited for seven months before inquiring about the status of the PFR), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ramos v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3558).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Murphy v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 206, 209-10 (1994), applied <span class="Italic">Gaydon</span> to a PFR lost in the mail:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's counsel avers in his declaration that the petition for review was deposited in the U.S. Mail on October 15, 1992, either by Lori Frodine, his firm's receptionist and billing clerk, or by Rose Stanton, his legal assistant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Stanton avers in her declaration that on October 15, 1992, she prepared the Certificate of Mailing pertaining to the original petition for review, a copy for the agency, and copies for two other parties. She further avers that the firm's expense records indicate that five copies of a 13-page document (corresponding to the number of pages in the petition for review) were made on October 15 and were charged to the Murphy account. She further avers that it is her practice to ensure that a pleading is mailed on the date indicated in the Certificate of Mailing, and that the firm's expense records indicate that she meter-marked 4 envelopes with 75 cents postage in the Murphy matter on October 15, 1992. Stanton also states that although she cannot specifically remember mailing the <span id="Page_1745"></span>petition for review on October 15, it is the firm's usual practice that Frodine take all mail with her when she leaves at 4:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> and deposit it in the U.S. Mail. Stanton places any outgoing mail prepared after 4:30 <span class="small">P.M.</span> in the U.S. Mail. Stanton concludes that either she or Frodine mailed the petition for review to the Board on October 15, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Frodine avers in her declaration that she reviewed the firm's copier and postage expense records for October 15, 1992, and based upon her knowledge of the firm's usual practice, the petition for review was prepared for mailing that day. Frodine reiterates Stanton's representations regarding the firm's procedures for handling outgoing mail, and concludes that either she or Stanton mailed the petition for review on October 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The declarations of Stanton and Frodine, taken together, are competent evidence that the petition for review was mailed to the Board on October 15, 1992. <span class="Italic">Cf. Taggio v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 56 MSPR 31 (1992) (the "specific," "plausible" and unrebutted assertions in a legal secretary's affidavit that she had deposited a petition for review "either at the Post Office or at the Post Office collection box" on a given date established that the petition was mailed on that date). We acknowledge that normally a conclusory statement that a pleading was placed in the mail on a given date is insufficient to establish that fact, if there is nothing to indicate that the statement is based on personal knowledge. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Anderson v. Government Printing Office</span>, 55 MSPR 548, 550 n.1 (1992). Here, although neither Stanton nor Frodine specifically avers that she recalls placing the petition for review in the mail on October 15, 1992, their statements regarding the circumstances surrounding the preparation of the petition for review and standard procedures at their firm are based on personal knowledge. Thus, the affidavits, taken together, provide circumstantial evidence that the petition for review was mailed on October 15, 1992, the last day for filing. The petition is therefore considered timely filed, even though the Board did not receive it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gaydon v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 198, 202 (1994).</p>
