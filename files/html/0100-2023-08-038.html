<h2 class="h2" id="sec1-39"><span class="space">III.</span> JURISDICTIONAL OVERVIEW</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1204 recites the Board's jurisdiction under its enabling statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, chapter 43 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provisions of law, take final action on any such matter[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"Jurisdiction is 'a tribunal's "power to hear a case," a matter that "can never be forfeited or waived."' <span class="Italic">Union Pac. R.R. Co.</span>, 558 U.S. at 81 (quoting Arbaugh, 546 U.S. at 514)." <span class="Italic">May v. McDonough</span>, 61 F.4th 963 (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP) (from dissent of Judge Newman).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Reform Act, its amendatory and supplementary statutes, and its predecessor statutes create procedural and substantive entitlements, and appellate and remedial rights to enforce those entitlements. The Board operates through affirmative grants of jurisdiction through statutes or implementing regulations. Unless there are statutory (or regulatory) restrictions, or benefits or restrictions contained in a collective bargaining contract, the government is generally free to withhold benefits from a variety of federal positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fowler v. United States</span>, 633 F.2d 1258, 1260 (8th Cir. 1980). "The Board does not have jurisdiction over all matters involving a federal employee that are allegedly unfair or incorrect." <span class="Italic">Mendelson v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3061); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sato v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-3443-16-0122-I-1 (NP 7/19/2016) ("The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Thus, it follows that the Board does not have jurisdiction over all matters involving Federal employees that are alleged to be unfair or incorrect. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 573, 577 (1995)."); <span class="Italic">Hipona v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 522, 525 (1989) (5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C) authorizes the Board to overturn agency actions within its jurisdiction that are not in accordance with law, but that section does not provide the Board jurisdiction over all actions alleged to be incorrect); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Van Gilder v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 337, 412 (1982) (the Board lacks authority to create a remedy for an appellant who has exhausted all judicial appeals and courts have found adequate grounds for an agency action). If the Board lacks jurisdiction over a matter, it lacks authority to refer the matter to another forum that has jurisdiction<span class="Italic">.</span> The Board ordinarily looks to the provisions of statutes in force when an action is taken to determine if the employee has appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. DOD</span>, 82 MSPR 649, 654 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-192.html#sec1-190">Department of Defense Education Activity</a>"]; <span class="Italic">cf. Bishop v. USDA</span>, 2022 MSPB 28., &#x00B6; 10 (2022) (defining the scope of "civil service law").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board has jurisdiction--authority to decide--an appeal, it does not easily yield that authority. <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 439, 442 &#x00B6; 7 (2003). <span class="Italic">Jonson v. FDIC</span>, 121 MSPR 56, 61-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2014 MSPB 22 (2014) (dissent by Member Robbins), said of Board jurisdiction, contrary to an argument that the agency's organic statute limited Board review rights in an adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) to replace the prior "patchwork system" of laws that had governed federal employment with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 445 (1988). The Board has jurisdiction under chapter 75 of the CSRA to review agency actions removing federal employees and to examine the reasons on which those actions are based. <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 684, 686 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d); <span class="Italic">see also Elgin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 132 S. Ct. 2126, 2130 (2012) (discussing both an employee's rights and the scope of Board review under the CSRA). As the Supreme Court has explained, "the CSRA makes [Board] jurisdiction over an appeal dependent only on the nature of the employee and the employment action at issue." <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2137 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 448-49 (holding that, given the "comprehensive nature" of the CSRA, the exclusion of certain employees from the protections of chapter 75 was deliberate). Here, neither party disputes that the appellant meets the definition of an employee for purposes of chapter 75 jurisdiction. Instead, the FDIC argues that section 19 of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTCCA), Pub. L. No. 103-204, &#x00A7; 19, 107 Stat. 2369, 2402-04 (1993) (codified as amended at 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f)), limits the Board's authority under the CSRA by empowering the FDIC to "prescribe regulations establishing procedures for ensuring that any individual who is performing, directly or indirectly, any function or service on behalf of the Corporation meets minimum standards of competence, experience, integrity, and fitness," including prohibiting individuals who have engaged in a "pattern or practice of defalcation...from performing any service on behalf of the [FDIC]." 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f)(4)(A), (E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot agree with the FDIC that the Board's jurisdiction is limited by section 19 of the RTCCA. There is nothing in the statute that suggests that Congress intended to circumscribe the reach of the CSRA. 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f). In addition, the FDIC cites to no legislative history that supports its position, and we can locate none. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 10 at 13-14 (failing to <span id="Page_34"></span>provide any such history); H.R. Rep. No. 103-103(I)-(II) (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3040, 3051, 3091-92 (discussing section 1822(f), identified as section 19 of the proposed legislation, without reference to the CSRA); H.R Rep. No. 103-380 (1993) (Conf. Rep.), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1993 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3098, 3101 (same). We are mindful of the mandate that, when possible, statutes should be read to "foster harmony" with each other. <span class="Italic">Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,</span> 511 U.S. 863, 879 (1994) (citing, among other cases, <span class="Italic">Ruckelshaus v.

(citation omitted)). Applying this principle, we read 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f) as empowering the FDIC to regulate the conduct of those providing services on its behalf, while still providing qualified employees with the full review of the Board for adverse employment actions under chapter 75 of the CSRA. We do not view these two principles as mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we decline to follow the regulations at 12 C.F.R. Part 336, Subpart B to the extent that they mandate the appellant's removal and limit Board review of that removal. Instead, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion regarding issue 6, that the Board has jurisdiction over the adverse action and the penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are statutes, and there are circumstances--e.g., national security--that limit or block Board jurisdiction and remedial authority, and they are discussed in portions of this and other chapters of this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>. Bottom line: the Board is the creation of statute, and statutes provide its jurisdiction. If there is no statutory (or in some cases regulatory) authority for the exercise of Board authority, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. The analysis of the Board's jurisdiction is an analysis of the statutes establishing limitations on defined government actions affecting enumerated groups of employees. [Refer to the Board's brief description of its jurisdiction at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/jurisdiction.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/jurisdiction.htm</a> and to its 2007 "Information Sheet No. 1: Jurisdiction" at <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Jurisdiction.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/appeals/infosheets/Jurisdiction.htm</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most actions appealed to the Board present no jurisdictional quandary. Adverse and performance-based actions appeals from OPM's retirement decisions, and reductions in force by tenured employees (those with the type of appointment and sufficient time in the federal service to qualify for appeal rights) move to adjudication, assuming a timely appeal, without complication. In other appeals, including those filed by whistleblowers and individuals seeking to negate resignations and retirements, the Board's jurisdictional analysis is elaborate and abstruse. Instead of accepting those appeals and adjudicating them on the merits, the Board requires that appellants make an initial showing through vaguely-stated pleading standards that the cases are within its jurisdiction. Appellants must then plead their cases with particularity and legal refinement to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of Board jurisdiction. What then ensues is a battle between the parties and the AJ over whether or not the appellant's allegations demonstrate Board jurisdiction to the AJ's satisfaction under subjective pleading standards. If so, the case moves to a hearing; if not, the case is dismissed as beyond the Board's jurisdiction. Heightened pleading requirements for atypical cases equate to the Board's use of summary judgment without application of that appellation to the process. The result is that advocates must, in any but routine appeals, scrutinize the case to determine, and then present to the Board, arguments and evidence demonstrating that the facts alleged in an appeal do or do not make out a case within the Board's jurisdiction. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>"; Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-2">Overview</a>" (describing appeals presenting prohibited personnel practice issues); and Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-112.html#sec17-108">Judicial Relief Outside the Reform Act</a>" (considering judicial remedies outside the appellate processes of the Reform Act).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most Board cases fall within several categories of appeals, each receiving chapter-length treatment in this <span class="Italic">Guide</span>: adverse actions [<a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a>], performance actions [<a href="0100-2023-16-001.html#sec9-1">Chapter 9</a>], reductions in force [<a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 10</a>], disputes over entitlement to retirement and restoration benefits [<a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a>], and Individual Right of Action claims undertaken by whistleblowers who allege reprisal [<a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>] . Other classes of appeals are derived from statute or regulation. These include appeals challenging OPM regulations and agency actions implementing the regulations; appeals challenging employment practices established by OPM; appeals involving suitability determinations; actions against administrative law judges; requests for review of arbitration awards involving actions and employees otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction coupled with allegations of violation of civil rights laws; and appeals under the 1994 Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) and its counterpart, the 1998 Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) (appeals that are increasing in number as servicemen and servicewomen in overseas conflicts return from military service and seek positions or reinstatement in the civil service).

<p class="Body-Text">Board jurisdiction is generally granted and limited by statute, <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 438, 442 (1989), or by OPM regulation, including appeals from reductions in force and limited appeal rights for probationary terminations.

DHHS</span>, 64 MSPR 517, 528 (1994).
