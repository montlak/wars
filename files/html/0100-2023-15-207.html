<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-206"><span class="space">9.</span> Invidious Discrimination; Offensive Remark or Conduct; Preferential Treatment; Reprisal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Discipline may be taken against supervisors or employees for creating an offensive working environment through religious or other discrimination. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Zimmerman</span>, 36 MSPR 274, 294 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Zimmerman</span>, a supervisor was removed for condoning and encouraging discriminatory conduct toward a subordinate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e believe that the major responsibility for providing a nondiscriminatory environment in the work place, free from discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult, rests squarely on the shoulders of supervisors and managers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Mongan</span>, 33 MSPR 392, 398 (1987) (regional director was suspended for 60 days for refusing to approve the promotion of a secretary in reprisal for her disclosures to the Inspector General); <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 95, 97 (1984) (NCO club manager was removed for favoritism, retaliation, and other misconduct). If an agency seeks to discipline a supervisor for discriminating against an employee, it must demonstrate in a disparate treatment case (failure to provide training) that there is a discriminatory intent. If the treatment reflects bad management and affects all similarly situated subordinates, the conduct is not discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Yeabower v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 10 MSPR 386, 388-89 (1982) (noting the absence of other acts tending to show discrimination). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-017.html#sec7-18">Sexual Misconduct</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Racially disparaging remarks may support discipline, but the remarks must be considered as to their setting, frequency, and intent. Removal for isolated racially disparaging remarks was mitigated to a 60-day suspension. Although <span id="Page_2710"></span>the remarks were serious and unacceptable in the workplace environment, the offense was an isolated incident; the appellant had 17 years of service, no prior discipline, and showed remorse by apologizing for his comments. <span class="Italic">Hyche v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 344, 346 (1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VA v. Chiappetta, CB-7521-16-0014-N-1</span> (NP 12/2/2022) (individual in an ALJ-equivalent position was removed for reasons that included his failure to take more active steps to prevent inappropriate use of government email facilities by colleagues of the judge who did not report to him; the judge was in a position of high responsibility and played some part in objectionable email traffic that included racist or otherwise offensive comments); <span class="Italic">Edler v. VA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco2022020">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) (adverse action based in part on inappropriate remarks concerning an ethnic group); <span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 153, 163 (1994) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension: use of racially inflammatory language was mitigated by provocation and harassing comments from others, and "the agency had permitted a work environment to exist where racially abusive language was almost commonplace"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cerros v. Steel Technologies, Inc.</span>, 288 F.3d 1040, 1047-48 (7th Cir. 2002) ("Although Title VII does not guarantee a happy workplace, it does provide protection for employees who suffer from discriminatory terms and conditions of employment through a work environment that is permeated with racial epithets that are tolerated by the employer.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Remarks to subordinates and potential employees by the appellant "expressing his belief that women could not perform the work in his unit because of the heavy lifting involved, and that he would never hire a woman to work for him," violated general statements of agency EEO policy and were sufficient to sustain a demotion. <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 592, 594 (1993), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 31 F.3d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (remarks made by the appellant did not constitute discrimination);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Levinsky v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered discipline tied to offensive remarks in the workplace in <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 281, 283-88 (1997), mitigating to a short suspension the demotion of a manager who made a reference to employees as "slaves" in a fax he sent to another office. Although the language was offensive, it was not racially tainted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The message was received on the Finance Office facsimile machine and was in plain view. It stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This is the report no one knows about. Took most of the day to complete. If you want this broken down into weeks, have Brenda fire up her slaves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several black Finance Office clerks who read the message claimed to be extremely upset about its reference to "slaves" and felt that it was a slur directed at them because of their race; after the matter was reported to agency management officials, the agency demoted the appellant. The appellant stipulated that he had sent the facsimile message with the remarks quoted by the agency and that several black Finance Office clerks had been offended by it; he nonetheless contested the agency's charge and questioned the severity of the penalty imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "Brenda" referred to in the September 1995 message evidently was Brenda Licata, a Finance Office supervisor; the majority of her subordinates in that office were black employees. The administrative judge found that the comments made by the appellant had significant racial overtones and that the demotion penalty thus was reasonable. He described the "traumatic effect" of the comments on the black Finance Office clerks who had learned of them and noted that the deciding official (Ms. Worrell) had cited that effect in explaining her decision to demote the appellant. The administrative judge also found that the appellant had tried to apologize to those employees and that he had expressed at the hearing his "sorrow" for the effect of the message. He determined, however, that the appellant's expressions of remorse were not genuine. In sustaining the demotion penalty, moreover, the administrative judge found that the appellant had a special responsibility as an agency manager to ensure a workplace free of racially derogatory remarks and that he had previously been counseled after two incidents in which he had made such remarks and had belittled a union official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that September 15, 1995, was the last day of the St. Petersburg Post Office's fiscal year and an extremely busy one for agency managers. On that day, the appellant and other agency managers were unexpectedly given the task of preparing a very time-consuming report for submission by the end of the day; this unanticipated assignment, given on an already busy day, frustrated and angered the appellant and his fellow managers. These feelings were exacerbated by the apparently wide-spread perception among the appellant and the majority of his fellow managers that the assignment was an essentially clerical task which could easily have been completed by Ms. Licata's subordinates. Those managers also perceived that Ms. Licata had an increasing number of subordinates assigned to her as "rehabilitative" or light- or limited-duty employees and that their duties were very ill-defined. The common belief among these managers was that these employees appeared to do "little or nothing," and the managers sarcastically referred to them as "slaves" to convey this belief in a facetious manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this relevant background information, the appellant explained that his use of the word "slaves" in the September 15, 1995 message was not intended to refer to either black or disabled agency employees as a class in a derogatory manner. He stated that he only meant to express (in an admittedly ill-advised way) his frustration at having to devote considerable time and effort on a very busy day to completing a report when other agency employees could just as easily have done so and when they otherwise appeared to have very little to do. Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the appellant never stated that he referred to Ms. Licata's limited-duty subordinates in this way because he considered them "stupid and lazy." As noted above, moreover, the administrative judge apparently perceived the practice of other agency managers referring to Ms. Licata's employees as slaves as indicative of a broad "racial divide" at the St. Petersburg Post Office and then discussed supervisory responsibility to ensure a work environment free of racial slurs. The record evidence discussed above, however, simply fails to provide any support for the conclusion that the use of this term was racially motivated or that it expressed any racial animus whatsoever.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge also found that the appellant had previously been counseled about an incident in which he had made "racially derogatory remarks." The incident (which the administrative judge did not describe further) involved a disagreement between the appellant and a black female employee (Ms. Dash) who had filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint against him; during the conversation at issue, the appellant became angry and stated his view that Ms. Dash was "using the fact" that she was a black female to get her way. This remark is not a slur on Ms. Dash's race, nor does it express any general racial animus against blacks; it does convey the appellant's opinion that Ms. Dash's use of the EEO process was not genuine and sincere. The administrative judge's very general reference to the remark as "racially derogatory" thus does not appear correct based on the record before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's conclusion, then, the appellant's September 1995 message was not an expression of his "proclivity to think and act in stereotype" with respect to black or disabled employees, and there is no basis in the record for doubting his remorse at the unintended harmful effect the message may have had on the black Finance Office clerks. The administrative judge nonetheless correctly noted that the message (whether it was meant to do so or not) did offend those clerks. After the incident involving Ms. Dash, moreover, the appellant had been counseled about the need for care in his written and verbal communications so that his remarks could not be "misinterpreted" as racial slurs or anything resembling them. The appellant does not have any formal disciplinary action on his record, however, and that record reflects that he has 28 years of service with the agency characterized by what Ms. Worrell admitted was "impressive" performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given this background, we find that the administrative judge correctly sustained the agency's charge of improper conduct because the appellant's use of the word "slaves" in the September 1995 message implicitly characterized an agency manager, Ms. Licata, as a "slave driver." <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 65 MSPR 46, 51 (1994) (an appellant's disruptive comments may properly be subject to discipline), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 48 F.3d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). With respect to the agency's penalty selection, our role is to ensure that the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). On this question, we acknowledge that the appellant's misconduct was widely known at the St. Petersburg Post Office and that it had a damaging effect on the work environment, particularly since the inappropriate message was sent to a facsimile machine to which many employees had access. These are factors aggravating the seriousness of his misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 305. Other aggravating factors include the appellant's status as an agency manager and his awareness through prior counseling of the need to exercise prudence in his written and verbal communications. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the same time, however, the appellant's long, distinguished record of service with the agency and his lack of any intent to inflict harm upon <span id="Page_2711"></span>his co-workers as a result of the message are valid bases for mitigation. Similarly, the record does not show that the appellant's expressions of remorse were anything but genuine, and they evidence some potential for rehabilitation on his part, which is another mitigating factor. Additional mitigating factors include the absence of any formal disciplinary actions on the appellant's record and undisputed evidence that the appellant sent the message while under unusual job tensions created by a time-consuming assignment given to him on an already extremely busy day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After careful review of the mitigating factors reviewed above, we conclude that demotion is not a reasonable penalty under the circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306. The lack of any malicious intent underlying the misconduct is particularly significant in this case, as are the appellant's apparently genuine expressions of remorse and resolve to avoid any similar misconduct in the future. As noted above, moreover, the appellant's record of service with the agency is very long, characterized by good performance and no prior formal discipline. These factors strongly suggest that a lesser sanction would be adequate to deter similar future misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 306.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion here is also bolstered by an examination of relevant Board precedent. The Board has found in this area that demotion is a reasonable penalty where the appellant has made blatant, frequently repeated racist and/or sexist comments. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sublette v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 89-90 (1995); <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 65 MSPR at 49, 52-54. By contrast, it has mitigated the demotion of a postal supervisor to a 60-day suspension where he made one blatantly racist remark but where the evidence indicated that he had shown remorse for his misconduct and that he had a long service record with no prior disciplinary actions. <span class="Italic">See Hyche v. US Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 344, 346 (1989). Based on the discussion above, the appellant's misconduct falls more readily into the latter category than the former. The agency's action here was based on his one improper use of the word "slaves" and not on frequently repeated use of racial epithets which are far more blatant and offensive. <span class="Italic">Compare Sublette</span>, 68 MSPR at 89; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 65 MSPR at 49. The sole instance of inappropriate language charged by the agency here is also considerably less blatant and offensive than the one involved in <span class="Italic">Hyche</span>, <span class="Italic">compare</span> 42 MSPR at 345. In fact, there is no evidence that the appellant here intended that his message have any racial overtones. Moreover, the appellant has expressed remorse for this misconduct; he also has a long record of "impressive" service with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, then, a suspension rather than a demotion is warranted for the sustained misconduct. We note that a more serious penalty than a suspension would be proper if the appellant had used a word that had obvious and unmistakable derogatory connotations or was intentionally hostile on its face to an individual or group. Here, however, the appellant used a term that has a number of connotations, is not linked exclusively to one group, and was not directed in a hostile manner to the group referred to as "slaves" or to the manager (Ms. Licata) implicitly referred to as a "slave driver" (the message was sent to Mr. Fairbanks and not to Ms. Licata). The facts here thus differ markedly from the situation described in <span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 153, 161-63 (1994) (removal penalty mitigated to sixty-day suspension), where the appellant made an abusive telephone call to a co-worker in which she referred to the co-worker as a "white bitch."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency and the administrative judge have also overstated the seriousness of the misconduct here by relying heavily on the response of several of the Finance Office clerks rather than analyzing the nature of the misconduct itself. Although some of those clerks charged that the appellant's comments were directed at them as black employees, the record does not support that charge (as discussed above). The appellant thus is certainly guilty of inappropriate behavior, but that behavior was not tainted with racial animus; his demotion therefore is not reasonable and does not promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We nonetheless recognize that, although the appellant did not intend his remarks to have any racial content, his use of the word "slaves" did have a disruptive effect (albeit, apparently unintended) on the agency work environment. We conclude, therefore, that a five-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 305-06.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kennedy</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, notwithstanding, conduct may be punished as discriminatory even though the appellant has no specific discriminatory intent, e.g., the action is meant as a jest, if the employee's acts have the effect of creating an improper work environment. The Federal Circuit sustained removal in <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 F.3d 595, 596-600 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Newton worked as an aircraft engine repair supervisor at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma. He had worked at Tinker since April 1976, and as a supervisor since 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, on June 18, 1994, the following occurred: Newton was supervising employees during an overtime shift in Building 3001 at Tinker. Guy Lewis, an African-American, was among the group that Newton was supervising. Following his return from lunch, Newton took two chemical mixing sticks, each approximately two inches tall and one inch wide, and used some wire to form them into the shape of a cross. He then placed the cross on a cart, sprayed the cross with alcohol, and lit it on fire in the work area where Lewis and others were working. As the cross burned, Newton called Lewis' attention to it. Newton then put the fire out and returned to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On Monday, June 20, the incident was reported to supervisor Paul Thomas. Thomas questioned a number of employees about it and, later that day, placed Newton on nonduty pay status. The incident attracted local media coverage, both on television and in local papers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated June 27, Thomas proposed Newton's removal. Specifically, the proposal cited Newton's "deliberate actions on 18 June 1994 that are considered racial toward a subordinate minority employee" and "reckless disregard on 18 June 1994 for the safety of personnel and the work environment." The first charge was based expressly on Item 29 of Attachment 3, AFR 40-750 (July 23, 1982) ("Guide to Disciplinary Actions"). Item 29 proscribes invidiously discriminatory conduct in the workplace as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29a: Discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicapping condition. Includes sexual harassment. Also includes making racial or ethnic slurs, or disseminating literature containing such slurs. Consider circumstances and the effect on the person(s) discriminated against, use of abusive language, violent treatment or insulting demeanor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Penalty for First Offense: Reprimand to 5-day Suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">29b: If the discrimination was deliberate. NOTE: If a supervisor, or manager has engaged in an act of discrimination, a decision should be made as to whether he or she should be reassigned or changed to a lower grade to a position of a different character.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Penalty for First Offense: Reprimand or Removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 8, after considering Newton's response to the proposed removal, Kenneth Breshears, the deciding official, removed Newton effective August 9. The removal decision makes clear that Breshears imposed the penalty of removal only after careful consideration of all the so-called "<span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Item 29b, unlike 29a, by its express terms proscribes only "deliberate" discrimination. Again, Newton contends that his act was not culpably "deliberate" because he intended only to be funny, not to be hostile or discriminatory toward Lewis or others along racial lines. The government responds that "the patently offensive racial nature of the act, combined with the steps [Newton took to burn the cross], clearly reveal that [his] actions were deliberate." Putting it another way, the government asserts that "[t]he Administrative Judge correctly found that Petitioner's conduct was deliberate, not inadvertent, and that although Petitioner may have intended his conduct as a joke, his intentions are not relevant to the charge." The government, like the AJ, equates "deliberate" with "not inadvertent." We discern no error in the AJ's construction given the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The drafters of Item 29b chose to proscribe "deliberate" discrimination, rather than, as Newton would have it, conduct undertaken with specific discriminatory intent. First, there is nothing about the term "deliberate," considered by itself, that suggests that a specific intent element inheres in the prohibition of Item 29b. Second, considering Item 29 as a whole, nothing about the conduct that Item 29a proscribes suggests that the government's construction of the term "deliberate" in Item 29b would make that provision redundant. For example, Item 29a forbids "disseminating literature containing such [racial or ethnic] slurs." One might contend that it is impossible to disseminate such literature inadvertently; the argument, if accepted, would render Item 29b redundant and thus severely undermine the government's equation of "deliberate" with "not inadvertent." But the contention is unavailing, for it is not difficult to imagine an act of inadvertent dissemination. Consider the case where an employee brings magazines to work for placement in a general reading area and, unbeknownst to him, one or more of these magazines contains patently offensive racist editorials or cartoons. This conduct, while inadvertent, would certainly constitute the dissemination of racially charged material into the work environment, thereby violating the prohibition of Item 29a. Federal agencies have it well within their power to seek to prevent such inadvertent injuries to the workplace environment. <span class="Italic">See Carosella v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("An employer is not required to tolerate the disruption and inefficiencies caused by a hostile workplace environment <span id="Page_2712"></span>until the wrongdoer has so clearly violated the law that the victims are sure to prevail in a Title VII action.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's interest in disciplining racially charged conduct is all the greater when, as here, the conduct is deliberate rather than inadvertent. Newton does not suggest that he was ignorant of the racially charged meaning of a burning cross; indeed, such a suggestion would fly directly in the face of his claim to have intended to joke with Lewis in the same manner that Lewis joked with him. Moreover, as the AJ noted, no reasonable person even remotely aware of our nation's history could fail to know the racist terrorism that a burning cross symbolizes. Newton's removal for this patently racial and deliberate act vindicates the Air Force's legitimate interest in maintaining an efficient operation. Any injury that Lewis may or may not have actually suffered is beside the point. The charge against Newton, correctly understood, has been proved beyond doubt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although we are <span class="Italic">not</span> reviewing a Title VII claim, it is worth noting that our construction of the word "deliberate" in Item 29b is fully consistent with the "hostile work environment" case law. In <span class="Italic">Rogers v. EEOC</span>, the earliest circuit case to construe Title VII as covering such claims, the court recognized that "the thrust of Title VII's proscriptions is aimed at the consequences or <span class="Italic">effects</span> of an employment practice and <span class="Italic">not</span> at the employer's <span class="Italic">motivation</span>." 454 F.2d 234, 239 (5th Cir. 1971) (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 406 U.S. 957, 92 S. Ct. 2058, 32 L. Ed.2d 343 (1972). The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that conduct that poisons the workplace is actionable "so long as the environment would reasonably be perceived, and is perceived, as hostile or abusive," <span class="Italic">Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 17, __, 114 S. Ct. 367, 371, 126 L. Ed.2d 295 (1993), whether or not the abuser specifically intends that it should be so. The existence of specific discriminatory intent <span class="Italic">vel non</span> is, in short, not an element of a "hostile work environment" claim. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Frazier</span>, 77 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("[T]he arbitrator should have evaluated whether Mr. Frazier's conduct created a hostile or abusive environment from the perspective of the one being harassed. Instead, it is apparent that he viewed the situation from Mr. Frazier's perspective by introducing intent as an element of the offense. By so requiring, the arbitrator improperly borrowed the <span class="Italic">mens rea</span> requirement from criminal law and interjected it into sexual harassment law."); <span class="Italic">Bolden v. PRC Inc.</span>, 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994) ("[I]t must be shown that...the harassment was racial <span class="Italic">or</span> stemmed from racial animus.") (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 116 S. Ct. 92, 133 L. Ed.2d 48 (1995); <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Brady</span>, 924 F.2d 872, 880 (9th Cir. 1991) ("Well-intentioned compliments by co-workers or supervisors can form the basis of a sexual harassment cause of action if a reasonable victim of the same sex as the plaintiff would consider the comments sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter a condition of employment and create an abusive working environment."); <span class="Italic">Bundy v. Jackson</span>, 641 F.2d 934, 945 (D.C. Cir. 1981) ("Sexual stereotyping through discriminatory dress requirements may be benign in intent...yet it violates Title VII."); <span class="Italic">Vaughn v.</span> <span class="Italic">Pool Offshore Co.</span>, 683 F.2d 922, 925 n.3 (5th Cir. 1982) ("The district court's legal analysis improperly focused on the intent of those who created the environment. We specifically noted in <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> that it is not necessary to show intent in a case challenging a discriminatory working environment."). Thus, where employees can reasonably perceive the conduct in question to be hostile or abusive, the actor's lack of specific discriminatory intent does not prevent his or her deliberate conduct from being actionable under Title VII.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the Air Force's choice of penalty in the instant case, it is well-established that, on appeal, the AJ's "affirmance of the agency's choice of penalty will not be disturbed unless it is so harsh and inappropriate as to exceed the agency's discretionary authority." <span class="Italic">Carosello</span>, 816 F.2d at 643....&#8197;The Air Force's concerns over the severe nature of the offense, its effect on employees at Tinker, and the threat it posed to Tinker's reputation, and thus its ability to operate, in the surrounding community are entirely legitimate.

<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the ways in which the appellant assisted the applicants was by personally hand-delivering their applications to the Human Resources office. The agency established that it was unusual for a selecting official to do this. However, the fact that it was unusual does not mean that it was improper. The agency did not identify any particular law, rule, or regulation that would prohibit the appellant from presenting these applications to Human Resources. Nor did the agency present any evidence that, by hand-carrying these applications to Human Resources, the appellant placed pressure on any agency official to act in a particular way. In fact, the Human Resources Specialist to whom the appellant delivered these applications testified that he did not feel coerced or pressured by the appellant to process the applications. The Supervisory Human Resources Specialist testified that it was improper for the appellant to hand-deliver the applications because they should have gone directly to her to ensure that there was no nepotism involved, the applicants were qualified, and their applications were in order. There is, however, no explanation of why the Human Resources office was unable to fulfill these functions merely because of how the applications were delivered. Furthermore, it is undisputed that the appellant's relationship with the two applicants was strictly professional and was limited to working with them one summer 2 years before the events at issue. We find that this is not the kind of close personal relationship that would give rise to an appearance of nepotism, conflict of interest, or use of public office for private gain. <span class="Italic">Cf. Welch v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 18, 22-23 (1988) (finding that an employee engaged in nepotism by creating a temporary position for his son and filling it without competition); <span class="Italic">Rentz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 35, 38 (1984) (concluding that a supervisor engaged in nepotism by evaluating his wife and recommending her for a promotion); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2635.502(b)(1) (relationships covered for conflict of interest regulations include close personal relationships with household members or relatives, as well as various relationships with financial implications), 2635.702 (an employee shall not use his public office for the private gain of friends).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also assisted the two applicants substantively. He informed them of the possibility of obtaining Police Officer positions under the 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) hiring authority, sent them information on applying under that authority, provided them with sample disability certification letters, and reviewed their r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;s. He also advised K.S. to get a second opinion when K.S.'s doctor declined to certify his disability. However, the <span id="Page_2713"></span>agency did not explain how the assistance that the appellant provided to M.H. and K.S. was any different than the assistance that they would have otherwise received from the Human Resources office. The record shows that the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist is also the "Schedule A Coordinator." She stated that she ordinarily would receive applications from individuals under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u), assist them with the application process, and counsel them about any deficiencies in their applications. Considering that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) applicants could normally expect to receive substantially the same assistance from the agency's Human Resources office that M.H. and K.S. received from the appellant, we find that the agency failed to establish that the appellant abused his authority by rendering that assistance himself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official, the Human Resources Specialist, and the Supervisory Human Resources Specialist all testified that the sum of the appellant's actions appeared to constitute "preselection" of M.H. and K.S. Based on how the agency conducts its 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u) hiring, however, we are not convinced that the appellant's actions constituted preselection. Under the agency's standard procedures, a selecting official will request a noncompetitive certificate, typically for vacancies that need to be filled promptly.[4] Such vacancies are unannounced. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Human Resources office then will assemble, from a repository of applications known as the "applicant supply file," a certificate consisting of individuals who are eligible for noncompetitive appointment to the position in question. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The selecting official then will make his selections from this certificate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;It is undisputed that there was an acute need for Police Officers at the Hampton VAMC during the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant recruited M.H. and K.S. with the intention of filling the vacant Police Officer positions with them, there is no evidence that he intended to select them regardless of what other candidates might appear on the certificate. In fact, the certificate that Human Resources compiled for the appellant contained only three candidates--M.H., K.S., and a third candidate, C.J.--whose name was obtained from the applicant supply file. Although the appellant selected only M.H. and K.S., he testified without rebuttal that he would have selected C.J. as well if she were interested, but when he contacted her about the job, she declined.[5] We therefore find insufficient evidence to agree with the deciding official that "from start to finish, there was no intention to select anyone else." For the same reason, there is no evidence to support the deciding official's conclusion that M.H. and K.S. were hired due to "preferential treatment."[6] <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">cf. Rayfield v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 13 M.S.P.R. 444, 445 (1982) (sustaining an abuse of authority charge where the appellant repeatedly selected one employee for promotion in derogation of another employee's promotion rights, thus affording the first employee preferential treatment and predetermining that he would move ahead in his career while the second employee would not).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The agency points out on review that the appellant offered no documentation to show that C.J. declined consideration for the position. This may be true, but the burden of proof on this charge lies with the agency, and not with the appellant. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii). If the appellant's testimony were untrue, the agency could have rebutted it by calling C.J. as a witness or otherwise obtaining a statement from her, which it failed to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;It could be said that M.H. and K.S. received preferential treatment over other potential applicants because they were hired noncompetitively for unannounced vacancies. However, this could be said of any candidate that the agency hires under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(u), and is therefore not attributable to any abuse of authority by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we disagree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's advice to K.S. not to list him as a reference showed any indication that the appellant believed that the assistance that he rendered to K.S. was improper. The email in question indicates that the appellant thought it would be inappropriate for K.S. to use him as a reference to be hired for a position for which he was the selecting official. It is not probative of whether the appellant believed that the assistance that he was providing K.S. was improper <span class="Italic">per se</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find that the agency failed to prove that the appellant abused his authority as alleged in Charge 1, Specifications 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Beck v. Dept. of Navy,</span> <span class="blue">997 F.3d 1171</span> (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Judge Taranto concurring) (considering preselection under USERRA.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rogers v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 377, 387-88 (1994), considered, but found wanting, a charge of improper favoritism toward a subordinate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the administrative judge erred in finding credible the appellant's testimony that his dealings with the employee primarily concerned professional business, arguing that the faxed letter to the employee shows the personal nature, not only of that fax, but of all of the dealings between the appellant and the employee. Emphasizing the appellant's comparison of his relationship with this employee to that with his wife and daughters, the agency suggests that this indicates the romantic and sexual nature of the appellant's letter. In fact, the appellant stated that he missed the employee's presence (while she was at training) and that, with the exception of his wife and daughters, he did not remember experiencing "any discomfort" from separation before.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While admittedly personal, this is not necessarily romantic or sexual. The appellant admitted that he sent a warm and supportive letter to his employee in an effort to boost her morale in the face of problems at the office. The comparison of his friendship with the employee to his relationship with his daughters equally supports the appellant's contention that he acted in the more nurturing role of a mentor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the contents of the fax, even if clearly personal, would not prove the contents of conversations held over the previous months between the appellant and the employee. The appellant admitted that he overstepped the boundaries of the supervisor-employee relationship with this fax, but such an admission is only marginally relevant to the character of the relationship over the entire period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleges that the administrative judge erred in not sustaining the specification concerning the inflated performance rating given this employee. The employee received an excellent rating in her first year of service and a fully satisfactory in the second year. The appellant admitted that his first assessment of the employee's performance may have been slightly exaggerated, but claimed that he used the performance appraisal as a tool to encourage the appellant. The administrative judge found this a valid exercise of supervisory discretion. The agency contends that an inflated rating was given for an improper motive, favoritism. As support for its position, the agency cites to regulations stating that a supervisor is to prepare an objective evaluation of an employee's performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency had not proven improper supervisory conduct under this specification. The appellant himself admitted a certain lack of objectivity in the rating, and he did not cite to a regulation allowing him the broad discretion to use the rating as a tool of encouragement. Similarly, the administrative judge did not provide support for his finding that the agency had not shown that such considerations were beyond the scope of supervisory discretion, except to note that the agency did not allege that the appellant had a sexual or romantic interest in the employee. Such a consideration is inapposite. The agency charged the appellant with improper supervisory conduct, not sexual harassment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given that the regulations cited by the agency provide that a supervisor must "ensure that ratings are appropriate and properly reflect the performance" of his subordinate employees, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency had not proven improper conduct in this specification. The Board has held that the preferential treatment of a subordinate employee is a serious offense in that it undermines public and employee confidence in the integrity of government officials. <span class="Italic">McIntire v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 578, 588 (1992). Therefore, we reverse the administrative judge's findings concerning this issue and sustain the agency's specification charging that the appellant improperly issued an inflated performance rating to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A finding of reprisal against a subordinate is sufficient to establish a charge that an appellant misused his supervisory position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hoag v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 449, 458 (1993) (sustaining demotion); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 MSPR 161, 179-80 (1996) (imposing a 90-day suspension against a supervisor who retaliated against a subordinate by terminating him after the employee announced he would file a grievance protesting a performance rating); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kamahele v. DHS</span>, 108 MSPR 666, 2008 MSPB 106 (2008) (sustaining the removal of a supervisor who suggested to screening managers that they offer employment applicants for Jack-in-the-Box to screeners who complained or raised issues, along with a charge of use of derogatory remarks during a counseling session with a subordinate); <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 98, 112 (1998) (charge of retaliatory behavior was sustained on a finding of appellant's "stated intention of retaliating against certain employees he considered to be backstabbers by denying them training opportunities").
