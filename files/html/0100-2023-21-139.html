<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-138"><span class="space">4.</span> Evidence Considered</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Sumbi v. DHS</span>, SF-0842-13-0243-I-1 (NP 7/23/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to enhanced retirement coverage. <span class="Italic">Olszak v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 75, &#x00B6; 5 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 475 F. App'x 757 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Eligibility for enhanced retirement coverage is strictly construed because it is more costly to the government than traditional retirement plans and often results in the retirement of important people at a time when they would have otherwise continued to work for a number of years. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">All relevant evidence, including position descriptions, should be considered in making the factual determination of whether an individual's service qualified for LEO of retirement under 5 USC 8336(c). <span class="Italic">Little v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 287, 288 (1984) (relying on <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United States,</span> 610 F.2d 760 (Ct. Cl. 1979)). The Board's analysis and result were affirmed, <span class="Italic">Little v. OPM</span>, 762 F.2d 962, 964-65 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As we discern its ruling, the Board in such cases requires three categories of information. When an employee seeks to contradict a position description, he must present, at a minimum, an assertion of the claim, corroborated by evidence which describes the actual primary duties, which in turn must be substantiated by supporting documentary evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such a requirement is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Ellis,</span> where the court considered the claimant's own assertion as well as a record "replete with affidavits" describing numerous occasions of his direct participation in firefighting. <span class="Italic">Ellis,</span> 610 F.2d at 764 n.7. Furthermore, the court regarded the increased deduction of pay to fund the benefit as evidence of the agency's belief that Ellis was entitled to the benefit. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 763, 765. <span class="Italic">Cf. Obremski v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 699 F.2d 1263 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (current employee seeking ruling of law enforcement officer status prevails based on own assertion and account, supervisor's letter, and position vacancy announcement which necessarily advertised the position as a law enforcement position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board seems to have applied that requirement to this case, Little's own letter was the assertion of a claim, which was corroborated by letters from two former supervisors stating what his actual duties were. The only substantiating documentary evidence was a record of one arrest made by Little for the entire ten year period. By way of contrast, in an analogous case the Board regarded as sufficient substantiating evidence an "Individual Firefighter Experience Record," which the record reveals was a summary log of the fires Cole fought during the period. <span class="Italic">Cole v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> No. DA08318310075, slip op. at 7 (MSPB July 29, 1983). Considering the evidentiary record as a whole, we cannot hold that the Board's evaluation of the weight of the evidence was unreasonable. Thus, the Board's decision that Little's evidence did not satisfy his burden of proof cannot be overturned under our standard of review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 76 MSPR 666, 669-70 (1997), considered the role of a position description, an agency "blanket" determination based on a position description for similarly situated employees, and other evidence in an LEO appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not err in ruling that the appellant had a right to have his retirement rights determined by comparison of <span class="Italic">his own service</span> [emphasis added] with the requirements for an LEO enhancement as set forth by law. We are mindful of the agency's objection that to require it to prepare an individualized determination of LEO coverage for each individual with the same position description would be unnecessarily burdensome and repetitive. That is not, however, what we require through this decision. The critical fact in this case is that the agency denied the appellant an LEO-enhanced annuity <span class="Italic">based on a position description which has never been made available to him.</span> We thus reject the argument that his claim must fail because he did not specify the ways in which his duties differ from those in the 1973 description. For the reasons set forth below, we rule that the agency can evaluate this appellant's LEO eligibility based on his <span class="Italic">current</span> position description and duties and can then dispose of subsequent applications without an individual determination, <span class="Italic">if</span> the agency notifies subsequent applicants of what position description and duties it is relying on, and considers claims that they are performing duties beyond those listed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 3337 (1995) (the regulations allow for blanket determination that a position is a law enforcement officer position). By the same token, however, "[when] an agency determines that the official position description does not show that the position satisfies the definition of law enforcement officer..., <span class="Italic">any individual may request the employing agency to review his or her actual primary duties</span> to determine whether they meet the definition."<span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 3338 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold, in addition, that the administrative judge did not err in ruling that OPM regulations do not support the agency's decision. The "regulatory reform" to which the administrative judge referred was codified by OPM on December 7, 1993, in interim regulations, and on January 17, 1995, in final regulations (with no change, from interim to final regulation, in section 831.911(e)). <span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 64,366 (1993) and 60 Fed. Reg. 3337 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that OPM's requirement of an individualized determination applies only "where the position description is claimed to be inaccurate," <span class="Italic">see</span> PFRF, Tab 3 at 6, citing 60 Fed. Reg. 3338; but that, in essence, is the situation here. The agency never reviewed either the appellant's own position description, or his primary duties, against the LEO definition at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20); and because the 1973 position description which was the basis of the agency's negative determination is not in the record, neither we nor the parties can assume it to be an accurate description of the appellant's current primary duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant seeks to contradict a position description (which is the position of the appellant in this matter when he has no knowledge of the position description against which he has been judged), he must present three categories of information: his current position description; testimony as to his actual primary duties; and supporting documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">See Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 241, 244 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Little v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 762 F.2d 962, 964 (Fed. Cir. 1995)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(a) (the burden is on the employee to provide the employing agency with "all pertinent information"). Upon remand, this is what the appellant will need to show.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to the agency's reliance on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.911(e) (no reopening of CSRS/LEO coverage determinations by the employing agency, in the absence of new and material evidence). We note, first, as did the administrative judge, that coverage determinations were originally made by OPM. We note, in addition, that even under the pre-1993 regulations, an appellant who received an adverse decision from OPM was entitled to an individual reconsideration by OPM, and then an appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.909(d) (1992) and 831.110 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM commentary to the 1995 final rule indicates that, at least in part, the purpose of section 911(e) was to prevent applicants who had failed to timely file an appeal with the Board from filing a renewed request with the agency (in the absence of new and material information) so as to revive the right of further appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed. Reg. 3337 (1995). Of course, this appellant could not have appealed the 1973 CSC decision, since it was not his case; indeed, apparently he did not even begin employment with the agency until November 23, 1975.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to blanket determinations regarding positions, <span class="Italic">Tyrell v. VA</span>, 76 MSPR 671, 674 (1997), added to the discussion in <span class="Italic">Davis</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in promulgating the 1995 final rule, OPM makes clear that although an agency may make a blanket determination that a given position is not a law enforcement position, the same OPM commentary adds that when the position description relied on is inaccurate, the individual appellant has the right to request the employing agency to review <span class="Italic">his or her actual primary duties</span> to determine LEO status. <span class="Italic">See Davis,</span> slip op. at 5 (citing 60 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4314"></span>To establish entitlement to service credit as a law enforcement officer, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1), the appellant had to show that the duties of the positions at issue met the definition set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). That provision defines "law enforcement officer" as an employee whose primary duties involve "the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States...." The appellant had to support his claim of entitlement to service credit with evidence describing the actual primary duties of his positions as well as corroborating documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">See Little v. Office of personnel Management,</span> 762 F.2d 962, 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Relevant evidence on this issue can include not only position descriptions but also the appellant's direct testimony as well as unsworn statements describing the actual primary duties of his positions. <span class="Italic">See Galuppo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 168, 170-71 (1988). In determining whether an employee's duties primarily involved criminal investigations, the Board considers whether the employee's work involved unusual physical hazards; long stretches of overtime; on-call status 24 hours a day; the carrying of weapons; frequent contact with suspected or known criminals; and/or the giving of Miranda warnings to witnesses whom he interviewed in the course of his investigations. <span class="Italic">See Hobbs v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 628, 633 n.5 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant's service as a Customs Inspector and Customs Patrol Officer was creditable, the administrative judge relied heavily on the report of the Customs Service's Special Pay Panel and the recommendation of the Commissioner of Customs. The Special Pay Panel's report describes in detail the general duties of a Customs Inspector but does not set forth the actual primary duties performed by the appellant. The Customs Service's request for law enforcement retirement coverage of Customs Patrol Officers like the appellant contains a one-sentence summary (from his position description) of the duties performed by the appellant; it does not, however, offer any account of actual law enforcement activities engaged in by the appellant. The administrative judge discussed these two items in detail but made only passing, general references to evidence in the record describing the actual primary duties performed by the appellant as a Customs Inspector and Customs Patrol Officer. As noted above, he concluded by finding that the two positions were law enforcement positions and that the appellant was entitled to service credit for serving in them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not correctly apply the applicable legal standard in this area. As noted above, the question presented regarding creditability is whether the appellant primarily performed law enforcement duties in his actual work as a Customs Inspector and a Customs Patrol Officer; it is not whether the two positions in general are law enforcement positions. <span class="Italic">See Little</span>, 762 F.3d at 964<span class="Italic">.</span> The discussion above reveals that the administrative judge's review of record evidence and his findings addressed the latter question but not the former; this was error. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In addition, by failing to analyze in detail the most relevant evidence in the record (the testimony and documents describing the actual primary duties performed by the appellant), <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> the administrative judge erred by not adequately summarizing the material facts in this appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversal of the administrative judge's ultimate finding of creditability, however, is not warranted. The appellant's sworn testimony and supporting documentary evidence in the record provide a detailed description of the actual activities engaged in by the appellant. In his testimony, the appellant explained that his area of operations as a Customs Inspector and Customs Patrol Officer (Nogales, Arizona, along the southwestern border of the United States) is characterized by an especially heavy flow of drug smuggling and the importation of other illegal contraband. As a result, the appellant stated that his actual duties regularly required him to investigate and apprehend those individuals suspected of violating the criminal laws of the United States. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The documentary evidence submitted by the appellant corroborates this testimony. It shows that the appellant actually engaged in surveillance and other intelligence-gathering activities specifically targeted at halting the criminal activities of suspected smugglers. It also shows that the appellant frequently pursued and helped apprehend suspected criminals in situations involving great danger to himself and that he was in fact injured on a few of those occasions. The record further reveals that the appellant has completed advanced tactical firearms instruction as part of his duties and that he is a member of a high-risk Warrant Entry Tactical Team involving the use of special weapons and tactics. The documentary evidence contains letters, incident reports, and commendations from his colleagues and supervisors describing all of these activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's sworn testimony and ample documentary evidence thus demonstrate that his primary duties as a Customs Inspector and Customs Patrol Officer involved criminal investigations and that they were law enforcement duties as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). <span class="Italic">See Hobbs,</span> at 663 n.5; <span class="Italic">Galuppo</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 170-71<span class="Italic">; Little,</span> 762 F.2d at 964.[5] The record thus establishes by preponderant evidence his entitlement to service credit for his tenure in those positions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM correctly points out, that the definition of "law enforcement officer" excludes from its coverage one whose primary duties involve guarding against or inspecting for violations of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. The discussion above establishes, however, that the appellant's primary duties did not constitute mere inspecting for violations of law but involved repeated, ongoing efforts to investigate and apprehend suspected or known criminals; the appellant thus met the definition of a "law enforcement officer." <span class="Italic">See id.; compare Hobbs,</span> at 631, 633 (regarding an employee who investigated unfair competition and unlawful trade practices by the alcohol beverage industry, and whose work rarely if ever resulted in criminal prosecution, the Board found that his primary duties involved guarding against or inspecting for violations of law rather than criminal investigations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence of LEO entitlement need not be entirely documentary, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 518, 520-22 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's uncontradicted testimony was corroborated by the summaries the appellant made of his diaries, the hearing testimony of a former co-worker and the written statements by other former coworkers, and thus "support[ed] a finding that his primary duties during these periods were the investigation, apprehension, or detention" of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against Federal criminal laws. She then found that the appellant nevertheless failed to meet his burden of proof because he failed to "substantiate the description of his duties with supporting documentary evidence" as required by <span class="Italic">Little,</span> 762 F.2d at 964-65. For the reasons discussed below, we agree with the appellant's argument on petition for review that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Little</span> to deny his claim, solely on the basis that he failed to present any "documentary evidence."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Little,</span> 762 F.2d at 964-65<span class="Italic">,</span> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit noted the Board's ruling in that case that "[a]ll relevant evidence, including position descriptions, should be considered in making the factual determination of whether an individual's service is law enforcement service for purposes of retirement under 5 U.S.C. Section 8336(c)."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 963 (quoting <span class="Italic">Little v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 22 MSPR 287, 288 (1984)). The court further noted the Board's finding that the record evidence was insufficient to carry the appellant's burden of proof because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the letters from his supervisors supporting his claim for LEO service credit were "summary and without supporting evidence."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Little,</span> 22 MSPR at 289<span class="Italic">.</span> The court then interpreted the Board's decision in that case to require that, "[W]hen an employee seeks to contradict a position description, he must present, at a minimum, an assertion of the claim, corroborated by evidence which describes the actual primary duties, which in turn must be substantiated by supporting <span class="Italic">documentary evidence,"</span> and noted that such a requirement was "not inconsistent" with existing precedent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 964 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not clear from the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Little</span> what types of evidence would constitute "documentary evidence" in this context, and the initial decision here was similarly unclear as to the meaning of "documentary evidence." We find it unnecessary to further examine this matter, however, because we do not interpret <span class="Italic">Little</span> to absolutely require "documentary" or any other particular type of evidence when an employee seeks to contradict a position description in order to establish his claim for LEO service credit. Although the court noted in <span class="Italic">Little</span> that the "documentary evidence" rule was "not inconsistent" with any existing precedent, 762 F.2d at 964, it did not definitively endorse such a rule. In fact, in affirming the Board's decision in that case, the court did not specifically rely on the lack of "documentary" or any other particular type of evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 965. Rather, the court concluded that, "[C]onsidering the <span class="Italic">evidentiary record as a whole,</span> [it could] not hold that the Board's evaluation of the <span class="Italic">weight of the evidence</span> was unreasonable."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board applied <span class="Italic">Little</span> to a situation similar to the present appeal in the case of <span class="Italic">Galuppo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 168 (1988). There, the Board held that, although the official position descriptions and performance appraisals were insufficient to establish the appellant's claim for LEO service credit, the administrative judge properly relied on the appellant's credible testimony and the corroborating unsworn statements by his colleagues and supervisors to find that the appellant was entitled to the service credit. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 169-71. In doing so, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Little,</span> 22 MSPR at 288<span class="Italic">, and Little,</span> 762 F.2d at 964<span class="Italic">,</span> simply for the proposition that "all relevant evidence" should be considered in determining entitlement to LEO service credit. <span class="Italic">Galuppo,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 170-71<span class="Italic">; see also Burrell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 113, 115 (denying LEO service credit for lack of corroborating evidence and not necessarily for lack of a particular type of corroborating evidence), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 862 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that entitlement to LEO service credit should be determined based on all of the evidence presented and is not necessarily precluded by the lack of "documentary" or any other particular type of <span id="Page_4315"></span>evidence, regardless of whether the employee is seeking to contradict a position description.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that <span class="Italic">Little,</span> 762 F.2d at 964 requires "documentary evidence" when an employee seeks to contradict a position description, we find that such a rule would not apply here. The record evidence established that no position description existed for the appellant's position as a private in the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department and that, therefore, he was not seeking to contradict a position description. Needless to say, more is required to overcome presumptively reliable evidence such as a position description than is required to establish facts in the absence of such contradictory evidence. We therefore disagree with the administrative judge's unsupported finding in her initial decision that the "documentary evidence" rule mentioned in <span class="Italic">Little</span> is applicable here even though the appellant was not seeking to contradict a position description.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 693, 696-700 (1995) (recon. den., 72 MSPR 327 (1996)), provided law enforcement credit for a GS-1801-13 Explosives Enforcement Officer based on testimony and documentary evidence concerning the officer's duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c), an employee is entitled to preferential retirement credit for service as a "law enforcement officer." A "law enforcement officer" is "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20); <span class="Italic">Hobbs v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 628, 631 (1993). In determining whether an employee's duties primarily involve criminal investigation, the Board considers whether the employee's work involves unusual physical hazards, long stretches of overtime, on-call status 24 hours a day, the carrying of weapons, frequent contact with suspected or known criminals, and/or the giving of Miranda warnings to witnesses whom he interviewed in the course of his investigation. <span class="Italic">Sauser v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 489, 492 (1993)....The appellant bears the burden of proof of his entitlement to LEO service credit by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 518, 520 (1993). The appellant must support his claim of entitlement with evidence describing the actual primary duties of his position as well as corroborating evidence. <span class="Italic">See Little v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 762 F.2d 962, 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The duties actually performed and not only the official position description determine LEO retirement credit eligibility. <span class="Italic">See Felzien v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 930 F.2d 898, 903 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record contains documentary evidence in the form of position descriptions, performance appraisals, reports, and commendations that the appellant submitted to the agency in support of his request for LEO status. The appellant also offered testimonial evidence at the hearing in support of his arguments. The documentation and witnesses showed that the appellant's duties include investigating crime scenes, collecting evidence, interviewing witnesses and suspects, preparing and executing search warrants, rendering explosive and incendiary devices safe, and testifying at criminal trials. As the administrative judge noted, the appellant's position description stated that the position involved physical exertion and "extremely hazardous situations." The administrative judge found that the appellant works long hours, including overtime, and is on-call. The record shows that the agency approved the appellant for administratively uncontrollable overtime. The record also indicates that the appellant works at all times of the night and day and has traveled to distant crime sites on short notice. The appellant testified that at times he carries a weapon but that his position is not one where the employee is ordinarily authorized to carry a weapon. Additionally, the appellant testified that he has given suspects their Miranda warnings, but acknowledged that a Special Agent in Charge was always present on those occasions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submitted evidence in the form of testimony that the appellant does not apprehend or detain suspects, that he provides technical assistance to Special Agents in investigations, and he is not authorized to carry a weapon and should not be in a situation where a firearm is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge concluded, and we agree, that the appellant met his burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the duties of his position were primarily the investigation of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. As the administrative judge found, the fact that the appellant did not also apprehend or detain suspects did not disqualify him from LEO status. <span class="Italic">See also Galuppo v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 168, 170-71 (1988) (LEO retirement credit was granted based on the employee's involvement primarily in the investigation of criminal activities). The administrative judge correctly rejected the agency's argument, reiterated on petition for review, that the appellant did not investigate "individuals" as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902, but only criminal acts, finding that there was no distinction between investigating the individual and the acts of individuals. Moreover, while the appellant's investigative work often takes place before a suspect is identified, the record shows that he also participates in the investigation of individuals when he interviews suspects to compare their statements with the physical evidence that he gathered, gives Miranda warnings to individuals, and participates in the execution of search warrants on the property of identified suspects. We find that the record shows that the appellant investigates individuals within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the administrative judge's conclusion is consistent with the Board's analysis of the legislative history of the LEO provisions in previous cases. These preferential retirement provisions were enacted to make the federal law enforcement corps a career service composed of young men and women capable of meeting the stringent physical requirements of law enforcement positions and performing at peak efficiency. <span class="Italic">Ferrier v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 241, 248 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Hobbs,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. at 632-33, the Board considered whether the existence or degree of hazard associated with the position should be a factor in the determination of LEO status. The Board found that stringent physical requirements were an appropriate factor and that the hazardous nature of criminal investigations, because of frequent contact with criminals and suspected criminals attempting to evade capture, required physical stamina and vigor. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Criminal investigations also frequently require working for long periods of time without a break, being on-call 24 hours a day, and carrying weapons. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For these reasons, the Board in <span class="Italic">Hobbs</span> found that employees who performed noncriminal investigations, which generally do not share those characteristics, were not entitled to LEO status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The employee in <span class="Italic">Hobbs,</span> a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Special Inspector, was not required to maintain a particular level of physical fitness, work frequent overtime, be on-call 24 hours a day, carry a weapon, maintain proficiency in the use of a weapon, give Miranda warnings, or have contacts with known or suspected criminals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In contrast, the appellant here often works overtime, is on-call, and interviews suspects. He carries a weapon at times, although he is not generally authorized to do so, and gives Miranda warnings in conjunction with a Special Agent. We find it particularly noteworthy that the appellant participates in interviews with suspects to compare their statements with the physical evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not indicate whether the appellant is required to maintain any particular level of physical fitness or proficiency in using a weapon. The hazardous nature of his position is the result of his responsibility for handling explosives as much as his contact with the criminal element. <span class="Italic">See Ferrier,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 244 (factors that distinguish criminal investigation from non-criminal investigation include unusual physical hazards for the investigator arising from frequent contacts with criminals and suspected criminals). In this regard, however, the criminal aspect of his contact with explosives adds to the inherent dangers of working with explosives. On balance, we find that the appellant's position shares more characteristics in common with the Fish and Wildlife Service Police Officer position at issue in <span class="Italic">Ferrier</span> and the Customs Inspector and Customs Patrol Officer positions at issue in <span class="Italic">Sauser,</span> in which the Board found that the employees were entitled to LEO status, than with the Special Inspector position at issue in <span class="Italic">Hobbs</span> in which the Board affirmed the agency's denial of LEO service credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues on petition for review that, to the extent that the appellant performs duties of an LEO, they are not his primary duties. Primary duties are defined as those that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)(i) Are paramount in influence or weight; that is, constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii) Occupy a substantial portion of the individuals working time over a typical work cycle; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii) Are assigned on a regular and recurring basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902. Duties of an emergency, incidental, or temporary nature are not primary even if they consume a substantial amount of time. Generally, if an employee spends an average of at least 50 percent of his time performing a duty or group of duties, they are his primary duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's position includes duties that are not LEO duties. He conducts training in explosives, prepares and reviews responses to requests for classification of explosives, incendiary devices or materials, and propellant and explosive industrial tools and devices, and provides technical support for the agency's regulatory activities. However, nothing in the record suggests that these non-LEO duties are paramount and constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position rather than his criminal investigative duties. Likewise, the record shows that the appellant's criminal investigative duties are not emergency, incidental, or temporary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency on petition for review argues that the appellant's primary work is the preparation of determination statements, in which he reports <span id="Page_4316"></span>his conclusion as to whether a particular device is illegal. According to the agency, this is not criminal investigative work. However, on reviewing the documents that the appellant submitted below regarding these determinations and the work they entail, we conclude that they are in many instances part of criminal investigations. The determination that the Agency cites as supporting its argument shows, rather, that the appellant took part in a criminal investigation. In that incident, an individual found what appeared to be an explosive device in a rental storage facility and called the local police who contacted the agency. An Assistant United States Attorney advised the agency's Special Agent Boland that the suspect, the tenant of the storage facility, should only be arrested if the items in question constituted a destructive device. The appellant and a co-worker were called to the scene where they photographed, x-rayed, and remotely disassembled the items. After transporting them to Salt Lake City, they examined the device and determined that it had the characteristics of a warning or intimidation device but contained no explosives and was not a destructive device. They further determined that the other items were explosives and noted that storing them within 350 feet of a daycare facility was illegal. In a caption under one of the photographs accompanying their report was the opinion that the warning device was used in marijuana fields to intimidate intruders. Marijuana seeds were also found with the explosives and warning device. In our view, the report indicates that the appellant's work exhibits a number of the characteristics of a criminal investigation, i.e., collecting and examining evidence to determine whether a crime was committed and the identity of the suspect. A review of the documents and the testimony support a finding that the appellant performs similar duties a substantial portion of his working time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant has established his entitlement to LEO service credit.</p>
