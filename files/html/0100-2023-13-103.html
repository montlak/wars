<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-102"><span class="space">e.</span> Termination of Light Duty</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may terminate light duty, possibly for lack of work. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 679, 685-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15, 2009 MSPB 50 (2009) (overruled as to the constructive adverse action analysis, <span class="Italic">Bean v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BEAN_KEVIN_CORTEZ_AT_3443_12_0159_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_942807.pdf">120 MSPR 397</a>, 2013 MSPB 96 (2013)), explained that the termination of light duty is not necessarily an action within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination of a light-duty assignment is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an adverse action appealable to the Board, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, and an allegation that an agency failed to afford an appellant minimal due process does not confer upon the Board an independent basis to review matters outside its statutory jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Riddick v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 369, 372 (1989). Although, under certain circumstances, an agency's termination of an employee's light-duty assignment may constitute a constructive suspension, these circumstances are not present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 637 (1997), the appellant alleged that the agency terminated her light-duty assignment, and that the agency denied her subsequent requests to return to work in her regular duties. The Board found that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence from work after she requested to return to her regular duties, and that she had therefore made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency subjected her to an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 639. In <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419 (1994), the Board found that, though the agency terminated the appellant's light-duty assignment, the letter terminating the assignment did not prevent the appellant from returning to work in her regular capacity. The Board found, therefore, that the agency's termination of the appellant's light-duty assignment presented her with the choice of requesting leave, applying for workers' compensation benefits, or attempting to perform the assigned duties of her regular position. <span class="Italic">Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419. It found that, though the appellant's choice was unpleasant, and though her ultimate decision to request leave may have been medically justifiable, "it was entirely voluntary and not at the behest, or under the control, of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 419-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in the instant appeal are more akin to <span class="Italic">Moon</span> than they are to <span class="Italic">Dize</span>. We find that, though the agency terminated the appellant's light-duty assignment, it did not prevent him from returning to work in his regular duties. Although Mr. Reid testified that he was instructed not to let the appellant work on June 2, 2008, and he barred the appellant from the workplace on that date, the evidence shows that Mr. Reid's objective was merely to prevent the appellant from performing further work in his then-terminated light-duty assignment, HT 2, Side B (testimony of Mr. Alvarado); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Reed</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 10 (although the appellant was escorted from the agency's premises and instructed not to return until the matter was resolved, the Board found that the agency did not prevent the appellant from working because the appellant had already made clear that he was unwilling or unable to accept the only available work within his physical limitations). Mr. Alvarado testified that, if the appellant had requested at that time to return to work in his regular duties, or even to return to work in his October 2007 light-duty capacity, he would have immediately granted the appellant's request. The appellant did not allege that he requested to return to work in either of these available positions. <span class="Italic">Compare Reed</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 10 (the appellant initiated his own absence because, after the agency terminated his light-duty assignment, he did not request to return to work in another available position) with <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 639 (the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence when she alleged that, after the agency terminated her light-duty assignment, she requested to return to work in her regular duties and the agency denied her request).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was faced with the unpleasant alternatives of returning to work with duties outside his medical restrictions, or requesting leave. <span class="Italic">See Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419-20. The appellant's decision not to return to his regular duties or to his October 2007 light-duty work, however unpleasant, was nonetheless voluntary. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 420. Therefore, the appellant did not suffer an appealable constructive suspension when the agency terminated his temporary light-duty assignment due to the absence of productive work within his medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Reed</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419-20. Because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension claim, the Board also lacks jurisdiction over his affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">See Reed</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 420.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's general revision of jurisdictional analysis in <span class="Italic">Bean v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BEAN_KEVIN_CORTEZ_AT_3443_12_0159_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_942807.pdf">120 MSPR 397</a> (2013), involving constructive adverse action appeals was applied to the termination of a light duty assignment, leaving the employee unable to perform a regular workload because of medical restrictions, <span class="Italic">Ramsay v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-14-0013-I-1 (NP 3/26/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> for the proposition that the termination of a light duty assignment is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an appealable adverse action. He found that in the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the agency terminated the appellant's light duty assignment but did not prevent her from returning to her regular duties. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, the administrative judge found that, although the appellant faced an unpleasant choice of taking leave or returning to the regular duties that exceeded her medical limitations, she was not subjected to an appealable adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, shortly after the administrative judge issued the initial decision in the present case, the Board issued an Opinion and Order in <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397 (2013), in which it expressly overruled <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Bean</span> that jurisdiction in constructive adverse action appeals is established by showing: (1) the appellant lacked a meaningful choice, and (2) this was because of the agency's improper actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The Board overruled <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> to the extent it treated the issue of voluntariness as the only one at issue. <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 12. The Board held that the constructive suspension claim in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, but that the dismissal should have been based on the absence of any improper agency action, rather than on a finding that the appellant's absence was voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13. Specifically, the Board noted that the agency in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was under no obligation to provide the light duty work the appellant requested. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Bean</span>, we find that the appellant lacked a meaningful choice when the agency terminated her light duty assignment, but that she failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency acted improperly in terminating the assignment. The agency provided the appellant with light duty work on her request, in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement, which called for reassignments that were "temporary, generally not exceeding 90 days." The appellant's light duty assignment lasted from late April 2013 until August 29, 2013, a period of more than 120 days. Accordingly, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive suspension appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer to <span class="Italic">Bean</span> earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-312.html#sec1-305">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board said of termination of light duty, <span class="Italic">Rutherford v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 570, 574-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10, 13-15, 2009 MSPB 214 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination of a light duty assignment is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an adverse action that is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). However, the termination of a light duty assignment resulting in an employee's absence for more than 14 days and a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987);<span class="Italic"> see Johnson,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 12. As identified by the administrative judge, constructive suspension claims may arise in two situations: when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform, or when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">McFadden v. Department of Defense,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 9 (1999). If an employee absent due to medical restrictions requests work within those restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation or contract to offer available light duty work, the employee's continued absence due to the agency's failure to offer available light duty work constitutes a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dispositive issue in determining whether a constructive suspension occurred is who initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">Alston v. Social Security Administration,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 11 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 134 Fed. Appx. 440 (Fed. Cir. 2005). If the appellant initiated the absence, then it is not a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An appellant who asserts a constructive suspension claim bears the burden of establishing that her absence was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We note further that "[t]he issue of whether the appellant was ready, willing and able [to work] during the entire period of his absence is relevant to the question of back pay or compliance; it is not relevant to a determination of jurisdiction, i.e., whether a constructive suspension occurred." <span class="Italic">Sherrod v. Department of the Navy,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 23 (2001); <span class="Italic">see Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 121, 128 n.7 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 383 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jurisdictional determinations in enforced leave cases are fact-specific. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 639 (1997), the agency advised the appellant that light duty work was no longer available. The Board concluded that the appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing because she nonfrivolously alleged that the agency initiated her absence, having stated that "she was fully able to work during the entire period of the alleged constructive suspension" and that "she returned to work and requested that she be placed on duty but the agency told her there was no work available."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> It was unclear, however, whether Dize asked to return to her regular position, or her former light duty position, and the Board instructed the administrative judge to decide that point on remand. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 639-40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conversely, in <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419 (1994), the agency's enforced leave letter told the appellant that "she would no longer be given light duty and that she could apply for leave or [Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP)] benefits." The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that the agency did not bar her from reporting to work or performing her assigned duties because it "offered her the choice of returning to her regular position or requesting leave and/or applying for OWCP benefits," and noting that a choice of unpleasant alternatives did not make her decision not to return to her regular position involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 419-20; <span class="Italic">see Johnson,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 15 ("The appellant was faced with the unpleasant alternatives of returning to work with duties outside his medical restrictions, or requesting leave.... The appellant's decision not to return to his regular duties or to his October 2007 light-duty work, however unpleasant, was nonetheless voluntary.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's response to the administrative judge's jurisdictional order constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence on December 5, 2008. In particular, the appellant alleged that, on this date, she informed management that she was able to perform the functions of her position, she wanted to work, and she did not want to take leave. At the same time, the agency's letter did not present the appellant with any alternatives, like in <span class="Italic">Moon</span>, and she was essentially at the agency's mercy regarding whether her medical documentation sufficiently demonstrated that she could perform the duties of her position. Because the agency appeared to be the sole decisionmaker regarding her return to work, she has nonfrivolously alleged that her initial placement on enforced leave was involuntary, and because we regard the facts of this appeal as similar to <span class="Italic">Dize,</span> they warrant a similar jurisdictional finding. As was the case in <span class="Italic">Dize,</span> it is unclear in this matter whether the appellant has asserted that she could perform her position of record, as opposed to her light duty position. Therefore, like <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, remand for a determination on that issue and to provide the appellant an opportunity to prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Dize,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 639-40. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was followed in <span class="Italic">Morrison v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-12-0016-I-1 (NP 11/1/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency had provided the appellant, a Mail Processing Clerk, with a light duty assignment, which entailed the performance of less than all of the duties of his position. On September 20, 2011, the agency informed the appellant that due to low mail volume, it could no longer offer him light duty. The agency offered him the options of returning to full duty as a Mail Processing Clerk, taking leave, or applying for optional or disability retirement. The appellant informed the agency that he could not return to performing the full duties of his position because of his medical restrictions, and expressed that he would seek disability retirement under duress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently filed a Board appeal alleging, in part, that the agency had constructively suspended him. Based upon the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction finding that the appellant did not suffer an appealable constructive suspension when the agency terminated his light duty assignment because of an absence of productive work within his medical limitations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recognized that two general situations may give rise to a constructive suspension claim. The first situation is when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an "inquiry" into his ability to perform. In such a case, the issue is whether the agency or the employee initiated an absence lasting more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 184, &#x00B6; 5 (2000); <span class="Italic">McIver-Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 464, 467 (1997). The second situation is when an employee is absent from work for medical reasons and requests to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies that request, even though it is obligated to offer the employee available light-duty work. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 539, &#x00B6; 12 (2003); <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 680, 692 (1996). There is no suggestion in this appeal that the appellant's absence was affected by either of these situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although an agency's termination of an employee's light duty assignment may, under certain circumstances, constitute a constructive suspension, the termination of a light duty assignment is not, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 679, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). For example, in <span class="Italic">Dize v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 635, 637 (1997), the appellant alleged that the agency terminated her light duty assignment, and that the agency denied her subsequent requests to return to work in her regular duties. The Board found that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency initiated her absence from work after she requested to return to her regular duties, and that she had therefore made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency subjected her to an appealable constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">Dize</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 639. On the other hand, in <span class="Italic">Moon v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 412, 419 (1994), the Board found that, though the agency terminated the appellant's light duty assignment, the letter terminating the assignment did not prevent the appellant from returning to work in her regular capacity. The Board found, therefore, that the agency's termination of the appellant's light duty assignment presented her with the choice of requesting leave, applying for workers' compensation benefits, or attempting to perform the assigned duties of her regular position. <span class="Italic">Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419. It found that, though the appellant's choice was unpleasant, and though her ultimate decision to request leave may have been medically justifiable, "it was entirely voluntary and not at the behest, or under the control, of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 419-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in the instant appeal are more akin to <span class="Italic">Moon</span> than they are to <span class="Italic">Dize</span>. When the agency terminated the appellant's light duty assignment, it offered him the opportunity of returning to work in his regular duties. Further, although the appellant was escorted from the agency's premises and instructed not to return until the matter was resolved, the agency did not prevent the appellant from working because the appellant made it clear that he was unwilling or unable to accept work then available. Thus, the appellant was faced with the unpleasant alternatives of returning to work with duties outside of his medical restrictions, requesting leave, or applying for retirement. His decision not to return to work to the duties of his permanent position, however unpleasant, was not involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Moon</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 419-20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argued that the elimination of his light duty assignment constituted a Reduction in Force (RIF) and the agency improperly failed to invoke RIF procedures. Although the appellant, through counsel, raised this argument below, the administrative judge did not address it. However, to the extent that the administrative judge's failure to address this argument was in error, her error did not affect the appellant's substantive rights and thus was harmless. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision). In this case, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated RIF procedures when it terminated his light duty assignment. While an agency must invoke RIF procedures when it releases employees from their competitive levels due to lack of work, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2), here the agency did not reduce the number of Mail Processing Clerk positions. Indeed, there is not even a nonfrivolous allegation that there was a lack of work for these positions. In addition, it is undisputed that the appellant could have returned to his Mail Processing Clerk position, but he declined to do so because he was unable to perform the duties of the position. The agency further determined that it could not carry the appellant in an unclassified light duty assignment because work volume had decreased for that assignment; therefore, it offered the appellant the options to <span id="Page_2106"></span>return to his official position, a position where there was no lack of work. Therefore, based on the undisputed facts in the record, the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See D'Leo v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 44, 48 (1992).</p>
