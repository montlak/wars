<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-125"><span class="space">B.</span> AWARD FAILS TO DRAW ITS ESSENCE FROM THE AGREEMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions may argue that an award is contrary to or unsupported by the negotiated agreement. The exception essentially argues that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority under the contract. FLRA does not conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the arbitrator's contract analysis. FLRA instead essentially restricts its review to ensure that the award is not an irrational contract interpretation. Under the "essence" exception the review criteria are whether the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. In contrast, FLRA conducts a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the award when the error charged <span id="page_1872"></span>is that the award is contrary to law, a topic subsequently discussed. Exceptions should specify the parts of the agreement that the arbitrator interpreted in a manner that was irrational, unfounded, implausible, or in manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and VA Pershing VAMC</span>, 71 FLRA 371, 372 &#x0026; n.4 (2019), <span class="Italic">recon. den</span>., <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and VA Pershing VAMC, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-121.html">71 FLRA 644</a> (2020).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the objection that an award does not draw its essence from the agreement, review is limited, <span class="Italic">DCAA, Central Region and AFGE Local 3529</span>, 60 FLRA 28, 30 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]ith respect to the Agency's essence argument, when reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the Statute provides that the Authority apply the deferential standard of review that Federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Labor (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators in this context "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 576.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "essence" exception is not met by a nonfact argument. <span class="Italic">DHHS and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-22.html">73 FLRA 95</a>, 97 (2020) ("When the Authority rejects a nonfact exception, the Authority will also reject an essence exception premised on that nonfact exception," citing <span class="Italic">HHS, FDA, San Diego, Cal.,</span> 67 FLRA 255, 256 (2014) (denying essence exception premised on denied nonfact exception); <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 72 FLRA 518, 520 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (denying a nonfact exception that was premised on a previously denied essence exception)).</p>
<p class="noindent">"[W]here an arbitrator's interpretation of contract language is one of several possible interpretations, it will not find that the arbitrator's interpretation fails to draw its essence from the agreement." <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FMC Lexington and AFGE Local 817</span>, 69 FLRA 10, 12 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting). The "essence" exception was interpreted, in the context of a disciplinary case, to require a showing that the arbitrator's interpretation of a negotiated agreement conflicts with the express provisions of the agreement, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 2369,</span> 63 FLRA 691, 692-93 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's role when addressing exceptions claiming that an arbitrator's award does not draw its essence from the parties' agreement has been narrowly defined by Congress. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-1272, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 153 (1978). Consistent with this narrow definition, the Authority has consistently reviewed arbitral awards under the deferential standards adopted by the Federal courts. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 220,</span> 54 FLRA 156, 159 (1998) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>); <span class="Italic">OSHA, United States Dep't of Labor (OSHA),</span> 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA,</span> 34 FLRA at 575. The above standard and the private sector cases from which it is derived make it clear that an arbitrator's award will not be found to fail to draw its essence from the agreement merely because a party believes that the arbitrator misinterpreted the agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA,</span> 34 FLRA at 575-76. The Authority and the courts defer to arbitrators interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement "because it is the arbitrator's construction of the agreement for which the parties have bargained." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 576; <span class="Italic">Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.,</span> 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Misco</span>) (as long as an arbitrator is even arguably construing the collective bargaining agreement, that a court is convinced that the arbitrator committed serious error does not suffice to find the award deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue here, is the interpretation and application of Article 23 of the parties' agreement, which sets forth the types of discipline that the Agency may impose with respect to employees in the bargaining unit. Article 23 also defines actions that the Agency can take short of discipline, such as counseling and oral warnings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement because the Arbitrator's mitigation of the penalty to counseling and oral warning, despite having found a serious offense, manifests a blatant disregard for Article 23 of the parties' agreement. In support of its argument, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">SSA, Lansing,</span> 58 FLRA 93, and <span class="Italic">SSA, St. Paul,</span> 61 FLRA 92, two cases in which arbitration awards were found deficient on essence grounds because the arbitrators did not administer disciplinary action consistent with the parties' agreements. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Lansing,</span> 58 FLRA at 95 (Member Pope dissenting) (award failed to represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement because, even though the arbitrator found that the agency had just cause to discipline the grievants, he did not administer any form of disciplinary action provided under the parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">see also SSA, St. Paul,</span> 61 FLRA at 94 (Member Pope dissenting) (award exhibited a manifest disregard for the agreement where it imposed the least serious form of discipline possible under the parties' agreement in the case of a serious infraction and the agreement allowed management to bypass its progressive discipline policy in favor of more stringent discipline in cases of serious infractions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that there was no just cause for the grievant's suspension and that, given the circumstances of this case, no discipline was warranted. The Arbitrator's conclusion--that the grievant's suspension be vacated and that the grievant receive counseling and oral warning--constitutes his interpretation and application of Article 23 of parties' agreement, and reflects his conclusion that this was an offense for which no discipline was warranted. Given the Arbitrator's factual findings that the offense--though technically serious--was inadvertent and was reported by the offender herself as soon as she realized her mistake, we cannot say this was an unreasonable conclusion. Unlike the awards which the Authority has found deficient because they failed to draw their essence from the collective bargaining agreement, the Agency fails to establish that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 23 conflicts with express provisions of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Okla. City Air Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.,</span> 48 FLRA 342, 348 (1993) (award deficient because arbitrator's interpretation of agreement was incompatible with its plain wording); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah,</span> 39 FLRA 103,108 (1991) (award deficient because arbitrator's reliance on collective bargaining agreement could not in any rational way be derived from that agreement and manifestly disregarded its terms). In this connection, we note that, as counseling and oral warning are within the scope of Article 23, the Arbitrator's remedy does not deviate from the confines of the parties' agreement. Consequently, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator's award cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See OSHA,</span> 34 FLRA at 575.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">SSA, St. Paul and SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Lansing</span> is misplaced. In each of those cases, the arbitrator found that some form of discipline was warranted (and the majority and then-Member Pope disagreed as to whether that particular form of discipline was permitted by Article 23 of the parties' agreement). Here, in contrast, by directing that the proper Agency response to the grievant's technical violation should have been counseling and oral warning, the Arbitrator found that no discipline--as expressly defined by Article 23 of the parties' agreement--was warranted. While Article 23 sets forth (and limits) the types of discipline that are available when discipline is warranted, nothing in Article 23 precludes an Arbitrator from finding that no discipline is warranted in certain circumstances.[2] Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Chairman Pope agrees that the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">St Paul </span>and <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">Lansing</span> are distinguishable based on the fact that, in those cases, the arbitrators found that some form of discipline was warranted.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the plain wording of Section 2 describes each party's responsibility for Union travel and per diem expenses for the period from FY 2013 through FY 2015. In particular, Section 2 obligates the Agency to pay the Union bargaining team's expenses through FY 2015. However, nothing in Section 2 requires the Agency to pay those expenses after FY 2015. We agree with the Agency that, by interpreting that silence as requiring the Agency to continue paying those expenses beyond FY 2015, the Arbitrator impermissibly created a new contract term.[10] When the parties asked the Arbitrator to interpret the GRA, they did not authorize him to fabricate a new contractual obligation out of whole cloth.[11] As we recently clarified, an "erroneous arbitral award[&#8197;] that run[s] counter to the plain language" of a contractual provision is not a carefully reasoned award that deserves, or will be accorded, deference.[12] Moreover, <span id="page_1873"></span>because Section 2 is unambiguous, and clearly does not require the Agency to pay the Union's travel and per diem expenses beyond FY 2015, the Arbitrator erred by considering extraneous evidence to find a meaning that is incompatible with the plain wording of that section.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">..."In the absence of any established burden of proof, [an] [a]rbitrator [is] free to determine which party [is] required to bear the burden of proof" regarding a specific issue.[26] As the Union does not identify any contract provision requiring the Agency to bear the burden of proving that an employee like the grievant did not properly inform her supervisor that she still was able to work on the weekend following a Thursday sick-leave absence, the Union fails to demonstrate that the award is irrational, unfounded, implausible, or in manifest disregard of the parties' agreement in this regard. Accordingly, we deny this essence exception.</p>

<p class="noindent">With all the discussion of the highly deferential nature of the "essence" exception, FLRA vacated an award involving a grievance over the denial of permission for outside employment when the contract disapproval standard was that the agency reason not be "arbitrary and capricious" and FLRA disagreed with whether the reasons offered by agency were arbitrary--as the arbitrator determined. The dissent argued that the arbitrator's analysis was rational, not subject to being vacated under the "essence" exception, and that the FLRA majority was substituting itself for the arbitrator as interpreter of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">DHHS, C&#x0026;BP and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2455</span>, 71 FLRA 106 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
