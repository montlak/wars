<p class="Body-Text">The Board's most recent decisions discount comparison of penalties based on past settlements, <span class="Italic">Portner v. DOJ</span>, 119 MSPR 365, 374 n.4, 2013 MSPB 28 (2013) (Member Robbins dissenting) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Singh v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 15 (2022), to the extent that the disparate penalty analysis should extend beyond the same or similar offenses)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two additional alleged comparator employees identified by the appellant apparently had proposed removals reduced to suspensions as part of last chance settlement agreements. The Board has held that, where another employee receives a lesser penalty, despite apparent similarities in circumstances, as the result of a settlement agreement, the agency will not be required to explain the difference in treatment. <span class="Italic">Blake v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 42 (1999); <span class="Italic">Dick v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 322, 325, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 975 F.2d 869 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). <span class="Italic">But see Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 24 (2003) (finding that, where an individual claims unlawful discrimination, she must be allowed to prove that the settlement agreement offered to other employees, but not offered to her, was a pretext for discrimination). Thus, under the circumstances of this case, the employees who entered into settlement agreements with the agency are not valid comparators.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Hara v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-13-4800-I-1 (NP 10/10/2014), confirmed the <span class="Italic">Portner</span> approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted evidence of 36 alleged comparators. However, eleven of the alleged comparators are not valid because their penalties were reduced as part of a settlement agreement, most commonly a last chance settlement agreement (LCSA). IAF, Tab 17 at 15-28 (LCSA), Tab 18 at 4-13 (LCSA), 14-22 (abeyance agreement), 48-58 (LCSA), Tab 19 at 9-15 (LCSA, same case as Tab 21 at 46-56), 16-36 (LCSA), 37-51 (LCSA), 63-76 (LCSA), 86-96 (settlement agreement), Tab 21 at 23-32 (LCSA), 44-45 (LCSA), 46-56 (LCSA, same case as Tab 19 at 9-15); <span class="Italic">see Portner v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 20 n.4 (2013) (holding that, where another employee receives a lesser penalty, despite apparent similarities in circumstances, as a result of a settlement agreement, the agency will not be required to explain the difference in treatment)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See O'Hara v. DHS,</span> 612 Fed. Appx. 593, 595 (Fed. Cir. 2015 NP) ("As we have explained, '[d]isparate treatment is not shown by comparing a penalty imposed by an agency with one emanating from a settlement agreement.' <span class="Italic">Dick v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 975 F.2d 869 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table)."); <span class="Italic">accord Moore v. DHS</span>, 779 Fed. Appx. 723, 726 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP) (citing <span class="Italic">Dick</span> while reviewing an arbitrator's award).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Board was not so straightforward in <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-14-0515-I-1 (NP 11/7/2014), considering but not finding probative value in the comparators offered by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the amendment to her petition for review, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that removal was a reasonable penalty, and she recites the Board's standard for disparate penalty analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). To the extent that the appellant is attempting to <span id="Page_2396"></span>raise a claim of disparate penalties, we find that she failed to prove it. To establish disparate penalties, the appellant must show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the misconduct and other factors, such as whether the appellant and the comparator were in the same work unit, had the same supervisor and/or deciding official, and whether the events occurred relatively close in time, to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. <span class="Italic">Boucher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 20 (2012); <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 15. The appellant's disparate penalties claim consists solely of her allegation that other employees at her worksite were offered LCAs for attendance issues. This allegation is insufficient to show that there is enough similarity between both the nature of the conduct and other factors to lead a reasonable person to conclude that the agency treated similarly-situated employees differently. Recognizing that the Board must accord proper deference to the agency's primary discretion in managing its workforce, we see no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that removal is a reasonable penalty in this case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board muddied its disparity analysis in two 1984 decisions bearing seemingly inconsistent outcomes. An employee was fired for falsifying a job application by failing to list a conviction. Another employee received a lesser penalty, apparently for the same offense, as a result of a grievance settlement. Although the agency offered no direct evidence to establish a legitimate basis for treating the employees differently, to require an explanation from the agency in order to discount the disparate treatment claim would have a "chilling effect" on settlement agreements favored by the courts and the Board. <span class="Italic">Nevels v.

<p class="Body-Text">A few days after the issuance of <span class="Italic">Nevels</span>, the Board decided another appeal, <span class="Italic">Jamison v. USPS</span>, 24 MSPR 327, 331 (1984). A black employee was fired for fighting. He submitted new evidence with his PFR, demonstrating that the employer retained a white employee who assaulted a private citizen on postal premises. The employer had proposed the removal of the white employee, but through a grievance settlement, the penalty administered was only a seven-day suspension. There was some other evidence of disparate treatment of employees. The Board set aside the removal, mitigating the penalty to a 30-day suspension for the black employee, concluding that the disparity in penalties should have been, but was not, justified by the agency. It was immaterial that the penalties were imposed by different postmasters when there was no evidence of a change in policy as to that specific conduct. <span class="Italic">Jamison</span> declined to find that the black employee demonstrated a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination; the penalty reduction was based only on disparity analyzed under a mitigation theory.

<p class="Body-Text">Occasional inconsistent decisions aside, <span class="Italic">Herbert v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 62, 70 (1983), expressed the Board's disinclination to review information pertaining to settlements to show disparity of penalties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board notes further that public policy strongly favors compromise and the settlement of disputes. <span class="Italic">In re King,</span> 3 MSPB 29 (1980). The courts have held that evidence of offers to settle and the terms of a settlement are inadmissible to demonstrate liability on the part of the party making the offer. <span class="Italic">Overseas Motors, Inc. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, appellants attempt to probe the facts and circumstances of the settlement agreements between the agency and other controllers in an effort to reverse their removals. The Board finds that the chilling effect such a probe would have on settlement agreements outweighs appellants' need for disclosure.</p>

Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 20 n.4 (2013).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board is not inclined to examine settlements with other employees on the basis of an appellant's argument concerning disparate imposition of discipline, evidence of settlements may find its way into the record, the agency may attempt to justify the difference in approach, and the Board may evaluate the circumstances. That occurred in a complaint brought against an ALJ, <span class="Italic">DHHS v. Canter</span>, CB-7521-12-0018-T-1 (NP 11/13/2014), involving alleged irregular attendance and one defense involving the agency's treatment of a couple other judges with alleged attendance issues who entered into settlements permitting suspensions, while the agency pursued a removal case against Judge Canter. The Board recited its precedent disclaiming an interest in reviewing settlements of cases involving alleged comparators, but the Board went ahead to acknowledge the settlements and then to determine that Judge Canter was not comparably situated because her absences exceeded the absences of the other judges and the other judges cooperated in the agency inquiry into the attendance problems, acknowledged their wrongdoing, and made an effort to explain their lapses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The relation between settlements and mitigation of penalties arose during the air traffic controller strike litigation in <span class="Italic">Bergh v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 794 F.2d 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The government settled some appeals by reinstating some controllers, but the government did not explain the reasons for failing to enter into like settlements with the petitioner and other controllers. Apparently the government explained in its brief to the court that it settled based on the likely outcome of individual cases. The court determined that the agency was not required to give detailed reasons in each particular case concerning the facts that led it to settle rather than litigate. The court concluded that the government was to be commended and not criticized for its settlement efforts. The removals were affirmed. The court reiterated that claims of disparate penalties will not prevail if the basis of comparison is a group of settlements in other cases, for these, the court said, are "different in their nature from actual decisions," <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-1374). <span class="Italic">Dick v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3272):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Disparate treatment is not shown by comparing a penalty imposed by an agency with one emanating from a settlement agreement.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 794 F.2d 1575, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The government may settle cases upon whatever terms it deems suitable when it determines that continued litigation is unwise. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An examination of EEOC decisions confirms that its reluctance to consider employees whose disputes were resolved by settlement as similarly situated is not inflexible; it is a general policy that may be and has been overridden by other considerations. Two distinct lines of EEOC cases emerge from this review. In one line of cases (<span class="Italic">Williams/Petty</span>), the Commission has recognized as a cognizable claim of discrimination the precise kind of disparate treatment claim the appellant has raised in this proceeding--that she was treated less favorably than similarly situated employees in that those employees, unlike the appellant, were offered settlement agreements or were permitted to resign. In a second line of cases (<span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, <span class="Italic">et al.</span>), the Commission has recognized a "bad faith" exception to the general rule where the discrimination claims of the similarly situated employees were resolved by consent decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Frank</span>, EEOC No. 05880836, 1989 WL 1006524 (Jan. 24, 1989), the Commission remanded to the agency the appellant's claim that a comparative employee who committed the same misconduct received a better settlement offer than was extended to her. The Commission found that "[a]lthough the agency explanation for the difference in treatment between the appellant and the comparative male employee would seem valid, this is a merits determination which can only be made after the complaint is accepted for processing." In <span class="Italic">Elifritz v. Garrett</span>, EEOC No. 01910963, 1991 WL 1186122 (July 12, 1991), the Commission considered the appellant's claim that she was not offered the same settlement opportunity as another employee who was not selected for the same vacancy. While it found that the appellant had failed to establish that the agency's failure to offer her a similar settlement was discriminatory because she "presented no persuasive evidence demonstrating that the agency's actions in this matter were improper or based on a discriminatory animus," the Commission recognized that such claims stated a cause of action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 6; <span class="Italic">see also Carter v. Frank</span>, EEOC No. 01872206, 1989 WL 609540 (July 26, 1989) (appellant alleged that she was disparately treated compared to another employee who committed the same misconduct but whose discipline was reduced in a pre-arbitration settlement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the Commission has recognized as a cause of action claims of discrimination based on an agency's action of allowing similarly situated employees an opportunity to resign, but not extending the same treatment to the appellant<span class="Italic">. Petty v. Runyon</span>, EEOC No. 01911697 (Aug. 22, 1991) (considering the appellant's allegation that employees who committed same misconduct were allowed to resign); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Henderson</span>, EEOC No. 01980846, 1998 WL 774576 (Oct. 23, 1998) (considering the appellant's allegation that another employee who failed to qualify on her scheme was permitted to resign and was then reinstated). On the basis of this controlling precedent, the Board will consider the appellant's claim that she was subjected to disparate treatment because employees whose conduct was comparable to hers (or arguably worse), were not removed, but were instead offered settlement agreements or were allowed to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a second line of decisions, the Commission has recognized a "bad faith" exception to the general rule that employees whose disputes were resolved by settlement cannot be considered as similarly situated-where those employees' claims of discrimination were resolved by consent decree:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The comparative employee's] proposed removal was reduced pursuant to a settlement. Generally, differences between MSPB, grievance, and EEO settlements terms do not provide probative <span id="Page_2398"></span>evidence of employment discrimination.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In setting forth the "bad faith" exception, all of the Commission decisions rely on <span class="Italic">EEOC v. McCall Printing Corp.</span>, 633 F.2d 1232 (6th Cir. 1980). There, the EEOC had brought an action on behalf of a group of black male employees who contended that they were denied back seniority benefits because of discrimination while such benefits had been awarded to a group of female employees. The employer in <span class="Italic">McCall</span> defended the action on the ground that its actions were consistent with a prior conciliation agreement that resolved a discrimination suit filed by the female employees and resulted in a consent decree. The court observed that when one employee is given increased seniority rights, this may adversely affect the economic rights of another employee. 633 F.2d at 1237. The court held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">conciliation agreements resulting in consent decrees may not be considered independent acts of discrimination, as a matter of law, <span class="Italic">unless there are allegations of bad faith in making the agreement, that is, allegations that the agreement was not a bona fide attempt to conciliate a claim but rather an attempt to bestow unequal employment benefits under the guise of remedying discrimination</span>.</p>

Although there are differences between the case before us and the <span class="Italic">McCall</span> cases, the major difference--the type of personnel action being challenged--strengthens, rather than undercuts, the conclusion that the Board is required to adjudicate the appellant's allegation that the agency discriminated against her because of her gender when it refused to settle her removal action (or allow her to resign) on the same terms as similarly situated male employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in nearly all of the EEOC cases cited above, the personnel action in question was a disciplinary action, and the allegation of discrimination was that similarly situated employees were treated more leniently<span class="Italic">.

When an agency fills a vacancy, selecting one applicant necessarily means that other applicants will not be selected. However, a disciplinary action against one employee has no necessary effect on any other employee. The concern that looking behind a settlement agreement will lead to the reopening of previously settled claims is not present in an adverse action case such as this one, where the litigant is seeking to show that similarly situated employees were punished less severely. The absence of this concern in disciplinary cases, such as <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, <span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, and the instant case, strengthens the conclusion that the agency's action of settling with some employees, but not the appellant, is not a bar to considering whether the agency's actions with respect to the settlement process were discriminatory.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In the <span class="Italic">McCall</span> line of cases, the courts relied on the "zero sum game" that is inherently a part of most hiring and promotion decisions, i.e., when there is only one position available, the selection of one employee forecloses the selection of another employee. The courts emphasized this factor in explaining the narrowness of the "bad faith" exception they were recognizing<span class="Italic">. See Marcantel</span>, 37 F.3d at 200-01 (any attempt by an employer to redress valid claims of discrimination would expose the employer to liability to other employees necessarily impacted by the remedy); <span class="Italic">Carey</span>, 812 F.2d at 625 (an employer could face suit by one group of employees if it fails to correct past discrimination, while facing suit by another group of employees if it does correct the past discrimination); <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 633 F.2d at 1238 (considering the consent decree as an independent act of discrimination could lead to reopening the claims which that decree resolved). This factor is not present in disciplinary actions such as this one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is a second distinguishing feature between the <span class="Italic">McCall</span> cases and this case that strengthens the conclusion that the Board is required to consider whether there was discrimination in the settlement process. Specifically, an agency's decision to settle with one employee on particular terms cannot easily be viewed as being part of a decision to discriminate against another employee when the settlement was brokered by an impartial third party<span class="Italic">. See Carter v. Frank</span>, EEOC No. 01872206 (July 26, 1989) ("it is unclear whether the settlement of the comparative employee's case resulted from an arbitrator's intervention in efforts to bring the parties into agreement"); <span class="Italic">Bowie v. Frank</span>, EEOC No. 01910968, 1991 WL 1186127 (July 17, 1991) ("appellant has alleged that he was discriminated against by the agency, and any settlement agreement reached through the grievance procedure involves the agency and the union").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Here, in contrast, there is no evidence that the agency's settlements with the male employees resolved any discrimination complaints, nor is there any evidence that there was any third-party involvement in the settlement agreements. Rather, the agency's decision to settle the disciplinary actions of five male employees appears to have been a unilateral one, not affected by any third-party involvement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the fact that disciplinary actions against similarly situated male students were reduced by settlement does not preclude the appellant from establishing that she was discriminated against on account of gender. Although the public policy favoring settlement is strong, the public policy against discrimination is stronger, and the Board cannot allow the settlement process itself to be used to commit prohibited discrimination. The appellant must be allowed the opportunity to prove that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of gender by treating her more harshly than similarly situated male employees, including an opportunity to prove that the agency's settlements were "simply a pretext to hide discriminatory treatment" of the appellant<span class="Italic">. See Marcantel</span>, 37 F.3d at 202.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hulett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 120 MSPR 54, 61-62 &#x00B6; 7, 2013 MSPB 48 (2013) (Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), interprets <span class="Italic">Spahn</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge found that the appellant proffered comparators who received decisions of removal for illegal drug use, but were subsequently offered LCSAs mitigating the penalty, and that the Board has held that an agency is not required to explain lesser penalties imposed against employees whose charges were resolved by settlements, despite apparent similarities in circumstances. <span class="Italic">See also Blake v. Department of Justice</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 42 (1999); <span class="Italic">Dick v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 322, 325, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 975 F.2d 869 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). The Board's precedent declining to compare a penalty to other actions resolved through settlement is grounded in its longstanding policy in favor of settlement. However, the Board has carved out a significant exception to that policy where an appellant alleges that the agency unlawfully discriminated in its settlement practice. <span class="Italic">See Spahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 195, 203-07 (2003). In <span class="Italic">Spahn</span>, the appellant claimed that the agency unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of gender by inflicting a harsher penalty on her than on seven male colleagues who committed similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Noting the "strong" public policy favoring settlements, the Board found the public policy against unlawful discrimination to be stronger and concluded that the fact that the disciplinary actions against the seven men had been resolved through settlement agreements did not preclude the appellant from establishing them as comparators. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 207.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Mickens v. Dept. of Transp</span>., CH-0752-14-0094-I-1 n.5 (NP 2/6/2015) ("The appellant has not alleged that the agency unlawfully discriminated in its settlement practice, and thus the agency is not required to justify its settlement with S.P. in response to the appellant's disparate penalty claim. <span class="Italic">See Hulett v. Navy</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 7 (2013).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A "last chance" agreement is treated as a contract, not as a penalty. This means that its use will not likely be set aside if there is neither fraud nor duress. In <span class="Italic">Burrell v. DLA</span>, 58 MSPR 372, 377 (1993), the Board noted that the mitigation analysis of <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span> "does not extend to the appropriateness of an agency's decision whether to offer an employee a last-chance settlement agreement, which is a contract and not a penalty."</p>
