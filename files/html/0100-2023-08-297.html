<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-290"><span class="space">6.</span> Recovery Period</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lee v. DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 256, 262-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-27 (2005), determined that USERRA claims are not limited to retroactive recovery by either the six-year period of the Barring Act or by the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Barring Act of 1940 does not limit the appellants' potential recovery in these appeals</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agencies state in response to the appeals, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that they apply the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> in harmony with the Barring Act of 1940, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, which set the statute of limitations for leave claims against the Government at six years after the claim accrues. The agencies contend and submit evidence indicating that they are currently accepting and processing such claims but that, to date, the appellants have not filed such claims. Thus, the agencies appear to assert that they intend to make the appellants whole with respect to their leave entitlements by offering them all relief to which they are entitled under the law. The agencies' argument rests on the assumption that the Board is bound by 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702 and the statute of limitations set forth therein, and cannot provide more relief than the statute allows. We disagree with this assumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Barring Act of 1940, codified at 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, the General Accounting Office (GAO) originally settled claims concerning federal employees' compensation and leave, compensation of deceased employees, and proceeds of canceled checks for veterans' benefits payable to deceased beneficiaries. Effective June 30, 1996, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act of 1996 transferred the authority to settle these claims from the GAO to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Pub. L. No. 104-53, &#x00A7; 211(a), 109 Stat. 514, 535. On June 28, 1996, the Acting Director of OMB issued a determination order redelegating to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) authority to settle claims against the United States involving federal employees' compensation and leave, deceased employees' compensation, and proceeds of canceled checks for veterans' benefits payable to deceased beneficiaries. <span class="Italic">See</span> Procedures for Settling Claims, 65 Fed. Reg. 40,967 (July 3, 2000) (now codified at 5 C.F.R. part 178). Congress subsequently codified these changes through additional legislation. General Accounting Office Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-316, 110 Stat. 3826.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702 ("Authority to settle claims") now provides, in pertinent part: "(a) <span class="Italic">Except as provided in this chapter or another law</span>, all claims of or against the United States Government shall be settled as follows:...(2) The Director of [OPM] shall settle claims involving Federal civilian employees' compensation and leave....(b)(1)...The claim must be received...within 6 years after the claim accrues <span class="Italic">except--(A) as provided in this chapter or another law</span>...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations pertaining to this claims settlement function specifically exclude from coverage "claims that are under the exclusive jurisdiction of administrative agencies pursuant to specific statutory authority...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.101(b). With regard to the statute of limitations on claims, OPM's regulations provide that, "[e]xcept as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section <span class="Italic">or as otherwise provided by law</span>, all <span id="Page_493"></span>claims against the United States Government are subject to the 6-year statute of limitations contained in 31 U.S.C. 3702(b)." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.104(a) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 13, 2004, the Director of OPM issued a Compensation Policy Memorandum (CPM) that "provides guidance to assist agencies in processing employees' administrative claims for annual leave as a result of the [court's] decision in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span>...." Citing the six-year statute of limitations in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, the CPM concludes that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">agencies may accept claims filed after July 24, 2003 (the date the [court's] <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> decision was issued), for crediting additional leave for military leave charged on nonworkdays between the date 6 years prior to the claim filing date (the beginning of the 6-year claims period) and December 21, 2000 (the date of the change in the military leave law).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no statutory time limit for filing an appeal to the Board under USERRA. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12; <span class="Italic">Tierney v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 354 &#x00B6; 6 (2001). The Board has the authority to hear and adjudicate claims arising under both USERRA and its predecessor statute, the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, without regard to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994, the date USERRA was enacted. However, the substantive provisions of USERRA are not retroactive, and the Board can enforce an employee's rights only as they existed at the time the claim accrued. Thus, the Board cannot adjudicate claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 based on actions that were not prohibited prior to the passage of USERRA. <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of the Army</span>, 234 F.3d 553, 556-57 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 109 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (1999). Although the Board has jurisdiction over such claims, they must be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 234 F.3d at 557-58; <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 109 &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) or (b)] ....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or [OPM] has not complied with the provisions of [USERRA] relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or [OPM] to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board is specifically authorized by statute, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2), to order compensation for "any loss of wages or benefits" resulting from any USERRA violation that occurred on or after October 13, 1994. This is true regardless of the six-year limitation provided in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, which is expressly made applicable only where it does not conflict with "another law." <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702(b)(1). Likewise, OPM's procedures for settling claims set forth at 5 C.F.R. part 178, subpart A, and the six-year limitation period set forth therein at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.104(a), do not apply to USERRA claims because such claims are within the Board's "exclusive jurisdiction...pursuant to specific statutory authority...." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 178.101(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This result is consistent with the Board's precedent regarding awards of back pay in adverse action appeals arising under 5 U.S.C. ch. 75. Relying on the predecessor statute to 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702 (former 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 71), the Board initially held that it lacked the authority to order back pay, even where it reversed an adverse action, or to determine the amount of back pay owed in the course of enforcement proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Blanchard v. Department of the Navy</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 393, 394 (1982); <span class="Italic">Ritchey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 27 (1982). However, the Board overruled these holdings in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 270, 272-73 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205, <span class="Italic">Powers and Functions of the Merit Systems Protection Board and Special Counsel,</span> the Board is empowered, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> to adjudicate any matter within its specified jurisdiction, "tak[ing] final action on any such matter," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1), and "order[ing] ...and enforc[ing] compliance with such order." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205(a)(2).[7] Further, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), of the Back Pay Act, as amended, after the finding of an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" by an "appropriate authority," such as the Board, an employee is entitled to an award of back pay. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[7]&#x2003;The above-quoted provisions of former 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1205(a) are now codified unchanged in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a), "Powers and functions of the Merit Systems Protection Board[.] " <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holtgrewe v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 14, 17, <span class="Italic">amended on other grounds</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 291 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In light of these statutory provisions, the Board will exercise authority to order back pay as appropriate in its review of the personnel actions subject to its jurisdiction. To the extent that prior Board decisions imply or hold that the Board lacks authority to order the award of back pay and benefits, they are hereby expressly overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">see Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that the guidance provided by OPM in its October 13, 2004 CPM, and the statute of limitations under 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, are applicable to agencies' settling claims for leave under OPM's procedures at 5 C.F.R. part 178, subpart A. These provisions do not, however, govern the Board's specific statutory authority to award compensation for lost wages and benefits under USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;The Back Pay Act does not limit the appellants' potential recovery in these appeals.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, these appeals fall within the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). As further explained above, USERRA expressly empowers the Board to "enter an order" requiring an agency or OPM "to compensate [the appellant] for any loss of wages or benefits" caused by the agency's or OPM's violation of a substantive provision of USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). The AJ ruled that any relief ordered under section 4324(c)(2) is controlled by the Back Pay Act, the relevant portions of which provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee of an agency who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination (including a decision relating to an unfair labor practice or a grievance) is found by appropriate authority under applicable law, rule, regulation, or collective bargaining agreement, to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay, allowances, or differentials of the employee-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive for the period for which the personnel action was in effect--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The pay, allowances, or differentials granted under this section for the period for which an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action was in effect shall not exceed that authorized by the applicable law, rule, regulations, or collective bargaining agreement under which the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action is found, except that in no case may pay, allowances, or differentials be granted under this section for a period beginning more than 6 years before the date of the filing of a timely appeal or, absent such filing, the date of the administrative determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In ruling that the above provisions control the relief that the Board may order under USERRA, the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Department of Energy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 48 (1999). <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> was an IRA appeal brought under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). Although the current version of the WPA provides that the Board may order "back pay" as corrective action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), the version under which <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> was decided, the WPA of 1989, did not. 81 M.S.P.R. 48 &#x00B6; 7. The Board nevertheless held that it could look beyond the WPA of 1989 and order back pay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Morgan</span> is consistent with the seminal decision in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Army</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 270 (1984), where the Board overruled earlier decisions, <span class="Italic">e.g., Barry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 561 (1983); <span class="Italic">Blanchard v. Department of the Navy</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 393 (1982), which had held that the Board lacks authority to order an agency to provide back pay upon reversing an adverse action. The Board's jurisdiction and scope of review in an adverse action appeal are governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513 and 7701, but those provisions do not grant the Board the authority to order back pay as a remedy. In <span class="Italic">Robinson</span>, the Board held that it could look beyond sections 7513 and 7701 and order back pay under the Back Pay Act in an adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> and <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> have in common is that the particular statutes that gave the Board jurisdiction and governed the scope of review in those cases did not authorize the Board to order back pay. The Board therefore looked outside of those statutes for authority to order appropriate relief. These appeals differ from <span class="Italic">Morgan</span> and <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> in that the statute that gives the Board jurisdiction and governs the scope of review also expressly provides for the relief that the appellants seek, <span id="Page_494"></span>namely, compensation for lost wages and benefits. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311, 4324. There is no need to look beyond USERRA for authority to grant the relief sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the appellants argue that they seek compensation for "loss of wages [and] benefits" under USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2), not recovery of "pay, allowances, and differentials" under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). They point out that the temporal limitation on back pay and leave restoration applies by its own terms to "pay, allowances, or differentials granted <span class="Italic">under this section</span>," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(4) (emphasis supplied), and assert that they do not seek recovery under that section. Whereas an appellant in an adverse action appeal who seeks back pay must rely on authority outside of the statutes that confer Board jurisdiction and govern the scope of the appeal, the appellants in these USERRA appeals need not, and do not, rely on any authority outside of the statute that gives the Board jurisdiction and governs the scope of review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language. <span class="Italic">See Hastie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 64, 75 (1984) (based on accepted principles of statutory construction, the Board declined to apply "broad" and "general" statutory provisions where there was "specific statutory language that bears on the particular issue under consideration"); <span class="Italic">see also Carney v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 394, 396 (1994) (statutory provisions dealing with a "narrow, precise, and specific subject" were applied instead of "general" provisions enacted at a different time). The relevant portion of USERRA, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2), is specifically tailored to provide a remedy for a person who suffered a loss of wages or benefits caused by a federal agency's failure to comply with a substantive provision of USERRA. The Back Pay Act, by contrast, applies generally to someone who was affected by an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" taken by a federal agency. We therefore hold that the general provisions of the Back Pay Act do not control the remedy that the appellants may receive should they succeed on the merits of their USERRA claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding that the Back Pay Act does not control the remedy in a USERRA case should not be read to mean that the Board can never grant a remedy under a statute of general application when the statute under which an appeal is brought contains a specific remedial provision. For example, in <span class="Italic">Auker v. Department of Defense</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 468 (2000), the Board held that it has authority to award attorney fees in an IRA appeal under the Board's general fee-shifting statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), even though the WPA contains its own fee-shifting provision specifically tailored to IRA appeals, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(B). The appellant in that case expressly argued for fees under section 7701(g)(1), however, and conceded that he did not meet the criteria for recovering fees under section 1221(g)(1)(B). 86 M.S.P.R. 468 &#x00B6; 3. Here, the appellants do not seek relief under the more general statute, nor do they concede that they fail to meet the terms of the specific remedial provision of the statute under which these appeals are brought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, our decision that the 6-year limitation on recovery under the Back Pay Act is inapplicable does not mean that there is no limit on the extent of the appellants' potential recovery. As explained above, in <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 109 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15, the Board held that it cannot adjudicate claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311 based on actions that were not prohibited prior to the passage of USERRA. We express no opinion on how <span class="Italic">Williams</span> specifically applies in these appeals because that would go beyond the question briefed by the parties and certified for interlocutory review. The AJ should, if necessary, consider this issue when he resumes adjudication of these appeals.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 498 F.3d 1328, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (six-year limitation of the Back Pay Act did not limit the recovery period in a military leave case under USERRA; the period for recovery is governed solely by 38 USC 4324(c)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harper v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 101 MSPR 166, 169-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2006 MSPB 30 (2006), rejected an agency's assertion that 28 USC 1658 placed a four year limitation on USERRA cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued before the AJ that the "residual" statute of limitations in 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658 applies to this USERRA appeal. The statute is entitled "Time limitations on the commencement of civil actions arising under Acts of Congress." It states that, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, a civil action arising under an Act of Congress enacted after the date of the enactment of this section may not be commenced later than 4 years after the cause of action accrues." The agency contends that 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658 controls because USERRA was enacted subsequent to section 1658 and USERRA is silent on the issue of any limitations period. It argues that the Board must apply section 1658 to dismiss the appellant's claim because he did not state a claim for relief falling within the limitations period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Tierney v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 354, &#x00B6; 6 (2001), the Board held that there is no statutory time limit for filing an appeal to the Board under USERRA. The Board's regulations also reflect this interpretation of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12. In addition, in <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256 (2005), the Board held that the Barring Act, 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3702, and the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, both of which limit recovery on certain kinds of claims to a period of not more than 6 years preceding the filing of the claim, do not apply in USERRA appeals; the Board reasoned that USERRA contains its own specific remedial provision, and that Congress did not intend for the Board to look beyond USERRA to other, more generally applicable statutes, in awarding relief to a successful USERRA claimant. All of this suggests that 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658 does not apply in a USERRA appeal, but the Board has never directly addressed the issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jones v. R.R. Donnelley &#x0026; Sons Co.</span>, 541 U.S. 369 (2004), relied upon by the agency, the court held that an employment discrimination claim brought under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1981, as amended in 1991, was governed by the 4-year "catch-all" limitations period at 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658. According to the court, although section 1981 was originally enacted in 1964, the particular claim asserted in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was not viable until section 1981 was amended in 1991. The court concluded that where a claim is "made possible" by a "post-1990 enactment," it is governed by section 1658's 4-year limitations period. <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 541 U.S. at 382-83. In <span class="Italic">Chugh v. Western Inventory Services, Inc.</span>, 333 F. Supp.2d 285 (D.N.J. 2004), also relied upon by the agency, the court reached a similar result in an employment discrimination case, with similar reasoning. The agency contends that the appellant's claim for improper charging of military leave was made possible by USERRA, a post-1990 enactment, and thus, his claim is governed by 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the agency's argument because a 1998 amendment to USERRA clearly indicates that Congress did not intend for USERRA claims brought against federal agencies to be covered by a 4-year limitations period. As originally enacted in 1994, USERRA did not specify whether the Board could consider an appeal challenging actions taken by a federal employer before USERRA's enactment that were prohibited under USERRA's predecessor statutes, such as the VRRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 103-353, &#x00A7; 2(a), 108 Stat. 3166 (October 13, 1994) (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 (Supp. II 1996)). Later, as part of the Veterans' Programs Enhancement Act (VPEA), Congress amended USERRA to provide that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b), without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub.&#x2003;L. No. 105-368, &#x00A7; 213(a) (1998) (codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(1)). This amendment became effective November 10, 1998, <span class="Italic">see</span> 112 Stat. 3331, <span class="Italic">more than 4 years</span> after October 13, 1994. The only reasonable inference is that Congress did not intend that the Board subject a USERRA claim to the general 4-year statute of limitations at 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658. Congress would not have amended USERRA to expressly authorize the Board to hear claims that accrued more than 4 years prior to the amendment, only to have such claims dismissed as time-barred under a 4-year limitations period found outside USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision in<span class="Italic"> Rogers v. City of San Antonio</span>, No. Civ.A. SA-99-CA-1110, 2003 WL 1566502 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 4, 2003), relied upon by the agency, does not lead to a different result. In <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, a magistrate judge accepted <span class="Italic">the plaintiffs'</span> argument that the 4-year limitations period at 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658 governed the damages that they could recover against a municipal employer for a USERRA violation, rather than a 2-year limitations period argued for by the employer. The magistrate judge's opinion is not binding on the Board, <span class="Italic">see Cook v. Department of the Interior</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 454, 459, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 132 F.3d 50 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table), and in light of our discussion above concerning the 1998 amendment to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324, we do not find <span class="Italic">Rogers</span> persuasive. Indeed, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324, which governs USERRA claims against federal employers, does not apply to municipal employers such as the defendant in <span class="Italic">Rogers</span>, and as a result the magistrate judge did not even discuss section 4324. It also bears noting that on appeal, the court in <span class="Italic">Rogers v. City of San Antonio</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 392 F.3d 758, 773 (5th Cir. 2004), expressly declined to rule on whether the 4-year residual limitations period applied in a USERRA case, emphasizing that the plaintiffs had waived any claim to relief beyond 4 years prior to the date on which their complaint was filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on all of the above, we conclude that the 4-year limitations period at 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1658 does not apply to a USERRA claim asserted against a federal agency under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324.</p>
