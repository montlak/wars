<h6 class="h6" id="sec5-183"><span class="space">(i)</span> Responsibility to Notify Board of Physical or Email Address Change</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">Parties need to inform the Board of address changes, electronic (for e-filers) and physical, during the pendency of Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 CFR 1201.14(b)(7), (e)(6); 1201.26(b)(2)(2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is not inclined to excuse a late PFR because an initial decision was not received on time when the nonreceipt is due to the appellant's error. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 102 MSPR 198, 200-01 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 158 (2006), involving an initial decision that was transmitted by electronic filing, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's unsworn statement on PFR had been sufficient to satisfy the Board's regulations at 5 C.F.R. 1201.114(f), he has failed to show good cause for his delay. The appellant claims that he did not find out until February 23, 2006, that a decision had been made on his appeal. However, he did not at that time request an extension to file a PFR. The appellant also asserts that the ID had "erroneously been sent to the wrong file" in his e-mail account. However, it is the appellant's responsibility to ensure that the Board has his correct e-mail information. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2004) (5 C.F.R. 1201.114(d) was not intended to postpone the deadline for filing a PFR where the delay in receipt of the ID was due to the appellant's own negligence). Moreover, he offers no evidence in support of his assertion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant informs the AJ that he wishes to convert from electronic to mailed filings and service of materials from the Board, the Board excuses a delayed PFR when the initial decision is mistakenly electronically delivered to the appellant and the appellant acts quickly to file his PFR after receiving a mailed copy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blatt v. Dept. of Army</span>, 121 MSPR 473, 475-76 &#x00B6; 5, 2014 MSPB 65 (2014). If the employee, previously represented by another, represents himself in an adverse action hearing, the AJ ought to secure the employee's current address rather than send the initial decision to the former representative. A delay in filing a PFR caused by the inability of the employee to obtain the initial decision permits the filing of an otherwise untimely PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lester v. VA</span>, 10 MSPR 359, 361 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the necessity for an appellant to ensure proper forwarding of his mail, <span class="Italic">May v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 557, 560 &#x00B6; 10, 2008 MSPB 89 (2008), declined to waive the filing period for a PFR delayed by years:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has failed to show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence that shows good cause for his untimely filing. <span class="Italic">See McPherson,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 547, &#x00B6; 5. Although the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span> on review, his nearly 8-year delay in filing his petition for review is lengthy and militates against waiving the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Uson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 Fed. Appx. 326 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Further, in asking the Board to waive the time deadline, the appellant asserts that he changed his address and did not receive the initial decision, but he does not claim that he acted with due diligence by forwarding his mail through the Postal Service or by contacting the Board to update his mailing address. <span class="Italic">See Lima v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 4 (2006). We find that the appellant's reasons supporting his request to extend the filing deadline are not persuasive because the Board has long established that an appellant is responsible for ensuring the receiving and forwarding of his mail. <span class="Italic">See Lima,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2004). The appellant's claimed failure to receive the initial decision notifying him of the dates for re-filing his appeal and filing his petition for review was the direct result of his failure to provide the Board with a current address.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Belandres v. DOD,</span> SF-315H-07-0430-I-1 (NP 12/6/2011) ("In asking the Board to waive the filing deadline, the appellant asserts that she changed her address and did not receive the initial decision, but she does not claim that she forwarded her mail through the Postal Service or contacted the Board to update her mailing address. The appellant's failure to fulfill these responsibilities does not constitute excusable negligence but, rather, indicates a lack of due diligence on her part.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need for the appellant to keep the Board informed of his or her current address was again emphasized, <span class="Italic">Moore v. OPM</span>, 112 MSPR 512, 514-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8, 2009 MSPB 209 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulatory deadline for filing a petition for review is not intended to postpone the deadline for filing a petition for review where delayed receipt of the initial decision is due to a party's own negligence. <span class="Italic">Laboy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 5 (2006); <span class="Italic">Lima v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 4 (2006). The certificate of service reflects that the initial decision was mailed to the appellant's address of record in Washington, D.C. The Board has held that service on an appellant at the last address of record is proper. <span class="Italic">D'Aquin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 499, 503 (1994). We find that the appellant's delayed receipt of the initial decision was the product of his failure to provide the Board with a current address. It is well established that an appellant is responsible for ensuring the receipt and forwarding of his mail. <span class="Italic">Lima</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 431, 433 (1997). Thus, we find that the deadline for filing the petition for review in this case was July 31, 2009, 35 days after the initial decision was issued. The appellant's petition for review was therefore untimely filed by 18 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the filing delay of 18 days is not minimal. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 396, 398 (1996). In his motion to waive the deadline for filing his petition, the appellant states that because the initial decision was sent to a prior address, he was unaware of the time limit for filing a petition for review. That explanation does not show that the appellant exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence. As stated above, the appellant does not dispute that the initial decision was sent to the address of record that he provided to the regional office, and he does not contend that he advised the Board of any change of address. Even though the appellant is acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, his failure to ensure that his mail was sent or forwarded to the proper address indicates that he has failed to act with due diligence under the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"It is well settled that an appellant is responsible for notifying the Board of any change of address and is also responsible for ensuring the timely forwarding of his own mail." <span class="Italic">Hairston v.

The rule on notice to the Board concerning changes of physical mailing addresses applies as well to changes in email addresses for those using MSPB e-filing procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v.

A brief delay will likely be excused if the appellant notified the Board of a new address and if the delay is caused by a mailing delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Santiago v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 179, 183 &#x00B6; 7 (2005). An untimely PFR is not excused because the appellant or his counsel fails to provide the Board with a change in address, causing a delay in the arrival of the initial decision. The Board has no duty to determine the current address of the appellant or counsel. <span class="Italic">Corbett v. MSPB</span> (Fed.

That changed with the Board's 2012 regulatory revisions at 5 CFR 1201.22(b)(3) requiring, in part, that "An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee." But under the law that follows, the appellant in Board proceedings is required to inform the Board of changes in address during the pendency of those proceedings.

MSPB</span>, 482 Fed. Appx. 540, 542 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before 1997, the Board's regulations required that petitions for review be filed within 35 days of the issuance of the initial decision. In that year, the Board amended its regulations to provide that petitions for review would be deemed timely if filed within 30 days of when the petitioner received the initial decision if the initial decision was received more than five days after it was issued. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 59,991 (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d)). In subsequent cases, the Board has interpreted that regulation to require the petitioner to notify the Board of changes of address and take other reasonable measures to ensure the receipt of mail from the Board. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 1, 3 (2004); <span class="Italic">McDonagh</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. at 682.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a letter to the Board, we asked for the Board's view on an issue that had not been discussed either in the Board's opinion or in the briefs to this court. Specifically, we noted that timeliness regulations regarding appeals to the Board from an agency's decision, which are similarly worded to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d), have not been interpreted to require the employee to show that he has taken reasonable measures to ensure that he will receive notice of the decision to be appealed. <span class="Italic">See Saddler v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1), which addresses the timeliness of appeals to the Board alleging that a personnel action was based, in whole or in part, on prohibited discrimination); <span class="Italic">Bradshaw v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 650, 655 (2010) (interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b), which addresses the timeliness of appeals to the Board challenging an adverse agency action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to our letter, the Board requested that we vacate and remand this case to give the Board an opportunity to "consider more closely the legal issues surrounding the Board's jurisdiction, as well as the evidence that implicates the Board's jurisdiction, and issue a decision accordingly." Because the Board, in its decision under review, did not address the similarly worded regulations cited above, we agree that it is appropriate for the Board to have an opportunity to consider whether it should interpret the timeliness regulation for petitions for review in a manner consistent with the interpretation given to the regulations for review of agency action. Accordingly, we vacate the Board's order dismissing Mr. Gomez's petition for review and remand this case for further proceedings before the Board.</p>
