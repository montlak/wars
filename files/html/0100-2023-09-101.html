<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-100"><span class="space">c.</span> OPM</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Retirement appeals add a wrinkle to Board jurisdiction. OPM often processes retirement applications through an initial determination and a reconsideration decision. The appellant ordinarily appeals to MSPB from the reconsideration decision. Under 5 CFR 1201.22(b) (2022), the appellant must appeal a reconsideration decision denying retirement benefits to the Board within the regulatory time from the date of the issuance of the OPM decision. The time limit, as in other appeals, is subject to waiver for good cause. <span class="Italic">Alo v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 571, 574 (1990). The reconsideration process and its relation to MSPB appellate jurisdiction is also described, with some criticism of the ambiguous nature of OPM's written advice to claimants concerning the process, in <span class="Italic">Toquero v. MSPB</span>, 982 F.2d 520 (Fed. Cir. 1993). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-042.html#sec2-41">Appeal Misdirected Within MSPB, to OPM, or to OSC</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-09-020.html#sec2-21">Negative OPM Reconsideration Decision Appeal</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-021.html#sec2-22">Failure to Seek Timely Reconsideration; Requests to Extend Time to Request Reconsideration</a>"; the process is considered at length in <a href="0100-2023-21-001.html#sec14-1">Chapter 14</a> on retirement cases.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulatory time limit for appeals to MSPB from OPM reconsideration decisions has changed over time. Through 1994, 25 days were allowed to file with the Board, clocked from the date of issuance of the reconsideration decision. The time was lengthened in 1995 to 35 days from the issuance of the reconsideration decision. In 1997 the Board again modified its regulatory guidance governing the time limits for appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed. Reg. 59991-92 (11/6/97). Current practice, under 5 CFR 1201.22(b)(1) (2022), calculates the time for filing from "no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If OPM does not advise the appellant of the right to request a reconsideration decision, but instead issues a decision denying the claim for a benefit, that decision is an OPM final decision appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Perske v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 678, 680 (1991) (MSPB had jurisdiction to review an OPM ruling denying the appellant's request for an enhancement of his annuity). <span class="Italic">Gosse v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 566, 569-70 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), examined the appellant's intent to pursue a Board appeal and avoided defaulting him when he directed his arguments to OPM despite having been advised by OPM to appeal to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, in his July 14, 1999 letter, sent to OPM well within the time limit for appealing the final decision to the Board, sought review of OPM's finding that he did not serve in a position subject to the Civil Service Retirement Act. Since OPM's June 21 final decision did not provide for requesting reconsideration of its decision, we will consider that letter as the appellant's intent to appeal OPM's final decision to the Board and consider it a timely but misdirected appeal. Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as untimely with no good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the issuance and timely receipt of a reconsideration decision on the merits, the appellant must then file a timely appeal with the Board. However, if the appellant fails to follow instructions in OPM's reconsideration decision and requests further consideration from OPM within the deadline for filing an appeal, and if OPM in turn fails to forward the otherwise timely appeal to the Board, then good cause exists for an untimely appeal. <span class="Italic">House v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 161, 165 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Patterson v. OPM</span>, 51 MSPR 408, 411 (1991) (excusing a late appeal despite the attempt by counsel to obtain additional consideration from OPM rather than filing an immediate MSPB appeal); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Frederick v. OPM</span>, 13 MSPR 141 (1982) (copy of a letter received by the Board regional office, apparently addressed to OPM, requesting appeal of an OPM reconsideration decision, should have alerted the Board to treat the letter as an appeal). [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-024.html#sec2-25">Failure of OPM to Act on Reconsideration Request; Failure of OPM to Advise of Reconsideration Right</a>."]</p>

A filing delay may also be excused if the OPM reconsideration decision fails to explain to the appellant that the filing date for a Board appeal is calculated from the date of the OPM decision, rather than from the date of receipt of that decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boulware v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board generally holds that an appellant's failure to follow explicit filing instructions does not constitute good cause for any ensuing delay. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 376, 379 (1992). However, the Board has recognized an exception to this rule in cases where appellants have timely but mistakenly sent appeals of OPM final decisions to OPM rather than to the Board. In such cases, the Board has found good cause for the untimely filing when the following conditions have been met: (1) The delay was caused in part by the appellant's failure to follow the directions set forth in OPM's decision and in part by OPM's failure to redirect an otherwise timely appeal to the Board; (2) the appellant clearly intended to seek further review of OPM's decision; (3) the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>; and (4) there was no showing of prejudice to the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., House v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Karker v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 235, 240 &#x00B6; 9 (1998), emphasized the statutory preference for adjudicating claims to vested retirement benefits.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Even if the letter arrived one or two days late, we would find good cause to waive the filing deadline because the Board has placed a high priority on resolving retirement benefit cases on the merits. <span class="Italic">Hemphill</span>, 77 MSPR at 512. As we explained in <span class="Italic">Edney v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 79 MSPR 60, 61-63 (1998), the whole purpose of the retirement application and appeal process is to determine whether the applicant is entitled to a retirement benefit. Unlike discipline or adverse action cases where an expedient response to an appeal enables the agency to move forward with the management of its programs, there is no such need for finality to compete with the right of an appellant to a decision on the merits<span class="Italic">.
