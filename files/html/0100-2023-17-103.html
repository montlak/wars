<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-104"><span class="space">1.</span> Substantive Rights, Harmful Error</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Losure, supra</span>, with the exception of notice provisions in Subpart H, proper application of 5 CFR Part 351 (2022) is a substantive right rather than a procedural requirement; accordingly, entitlements are not subject to the harmful error standard. The law, however, injects something approaching a harmful error test as to RIF determinations to avoid RIF actions being set aside for procedural irregularities. The "distinction between procedure and substance is not always crisp." <span class="Italic">DOD, AAFES v. FLRA</span>, 659 F.2d 1140, 1151 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (federal sector labor relations case outlining approaches to bargaining). What can be difficult to discern under current law from the Board is the dividing line between an action that should have been conducted as a RIF, was not conducted in that manner, and is challenged on appeal, and the action that is conducted as a RIF but with some degree of procedural impropriety. The question becomes how far the Board is willing to allow an agency to retroactively reconstruct the RIF during the Board appeal process to demonstrate that the lack of procedural regularity should not cause the agency action to be set aside. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-065.html#sec10-66">Impact of Error</a>"; refer to <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 11</a> for harmful error.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of a retention standing error, <span class="Italic">Garay v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0351-13-0043-I-1 (NP 7/11/2014), reversed a RIF outright rather than applying a harmful error analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held that the proper determination of an employee's entitlement under the RIF regulations is a substantive right of the employee, which is not subject to the harmful error standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">E.g., Wright v. Department of Commerce</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 36, 38 (1984); <span class="Italic">Ray v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 445, 447 (1980); <span class="Italic">Losure</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 201 n.5. Moreover, like here, when an agency discovers an error in the determination of an employee's retention standing, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.306(c) requires that the agency correct the error and adjust any erroneous RIF action to accord with the employee's proper retention standing as of the date that the agency released the employee from his competitive level. Our review of the hearing testimony confirms the administrative judge's finding that the agency was on notice that the appellant's preference status had changed, and the record indicates that the change occurred on August 27, 2012, before the September 30, 2012 effective date of the RIF. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burciaga v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.506(c) requires agencies to correct an employee's retention standing to reflect any changes to that employee's veterans' preference status, which occurred before the effective date of the RIF). Thus, in accordance with the regulation, the agency must cancel the RIF action and restore the appellant. <span class="Italic">E.g., Wright</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 38.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 307, 331-32 (1994), one of many postal reorganization challenges, declined to apply a harmful error approach when an agency should have but failed to apply RIF regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has long recognized that employees' RIF assignment rights are substantive. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hill v. Department of Commerce,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 205, 208-09 (1984) (in determining whether employee's substantive rights had been adversely affected, Board reviewed evidence concerning employee's RIF assignment rights). For this reason, and for the other reasons stated above, we find that the appellants' demotions cannot be sustained unless the agency establishes that its failure to apply the RIF regulations had no adverse effect on the appellants' assignment rights. Not only has the agency failed to make such a showing, but it concedes that it is not even alleging that such a showing could be made. We agree with the administrative judge that, in light of the agency's complete failure to follow RIF procedures, including its failure to establish competitive areas and competitive levels, the appellants' demotions cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Cramton v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 558, 560-61 (1985) (because the agency failed to make any determinations whatsoever under 5 C.F.R. part 351, it would be inappropriate for the Board to determine how the agency might have acted under those regulations); <span class="Italic">see also McClure v. Federal Emergency Management Agency,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 672, 676 (1987) (RIF actions not sustained where agency failed to apply RIF regulations); <span class="Italic">compare Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 684 F.2d 155, 157--59 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (because the agency had not exercised its discretion under the RIF regulations, neither the Board nor the court could properly evaluate the agency's discretionary acts, and the RIF actions therefore could not be sustained), <span class="Italic">with Mayo v. Hodel,</span> 741 F.2d 441, 443-44 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (although speculation about what the agency might have done had it applied the RIF rules ordinarily is foreclosed, the failure to apply those rules may be found harmless when there is no room for the agency's exercise of discretion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered the problem of retroactive application of RIF procedures in <span class="Italic">Cramton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 27 MSPR 558, 560-61 (1985), referenced in <span class="Italic">Robinson, supra,</span> reversing (under then-controlling regulations) an improper downgrading resulting from reclassification due to a change in duties but without the protection of RIF procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the Board's remand order, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit invoked a rule long established by the U.S. Supreme Court that the Board's retrospective determination of an appellant's RIF rights was an improper procedure. <span class="Italic">Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 684 F.2d 155, 157 (1982), citing <span class="Italic">Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery</span>, 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947). The court held that the Board's proper role as an independent administrative adjudicator is to evaluate agency discretion as it has been exercised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Hodel</span>, 741 F.2d 441, 443 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the court held that <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> application of the RIF regulations, in order to determine whether such application might alter the outcome of the agency action, is permissible where the Board is "plainly right" in application of RIF procedures. The Circuit Court distinguished <span class="Italic">Horne</span> wherein the agency had some discretionary leeway to reach more than <span id="Page_3110"></span>one proper outcome in applying RIF procedures, whereas the agency had no such discretionary leeway under the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Mayo</span>.[1] The agency in this case had, as in <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, "substantial discretion to decide when to invoke a RIF," discretion to define the scope of competition in establishing competitive areas and levels, and various options in determining assignment rights. It would be inappropriate for the Board now to decide this case on how the agency "might have acted if it had followed the proper procedures."...&#8197;This rationale becomes even more compelling when no determinations whatsoever under Part 351 were initially provided appellant, thus precluding his opportunity to contest the propriety of the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note, in addition, the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Horne</span> can be distinguished from our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Certain Former Community Services Administration Employees v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 21 MSPR 379 (1984), where we held that retroactive application of RIF procedures was proper when the affected employee had been afforded procedural protections under 5 CFR Part 351, and there was no resulting infringement of substantive rights. However, in <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, as in the instant appeal, no attempt was made to afford the employee any protections under 5 CFR Part 351.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also referenced in <span class="Italic">Robinson</span> was <span class="Italic">McClure v. FEMA</span>, 32 MSPR 672, 676 (1987), disavowing an interest in reconstructing a RIF when management circumvented RIF procedures in one reassignment that led to another job action taken pursuant to RIF processes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n view of the agency's failure to afford the appellant any substantive procedures, we need not specifically review the propriety of the appellant's assignment rights. <span class="Italic">Cramton</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 560-61. We conclude that the agency impermissibly circumvented the RIF regulations and violated the appellant's substantive and procedural RIF rights. <span class="Italic">Cf. Peters v. Department of Energy,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 253, 254-55 (1985) (the agency engaged in impermissible circumvention of RIF regulations, and violated the appellant's RIF rights, by promoting another employee to avoid his being "bumped" by the appellant in the course of a reorganization).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's subsequent RIF action assigning the appellant to the position of Education Program Specialist, GS-12, is tainted by the prior improper agency action. The second RIF action cannot serve to correct the agency's procedural lapse in the initial action and must also be reversed because the Board is unable to determine whether the proper application of RIF procedures in the first action might alter the outcome of the second RIF action. <span class="Italic">See Cramton,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. at 560-61.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cramton</span> referenced the <span class="Italic">Mayo</span> decision in the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Hodel</span>, 741 F.2d 441, 443-44 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">affirming</span> <span class="Italic">Mayo v. Edwards</span>, 562 F. Supp. 907 (D.D.C. 1983), discerned no reason to reverse a procedurally irregular termination that should have been structured as a RIF. Had the RIF occurred, the court had no doubt that the appellant would have been separated. The conclusion led the circuit court in <span class="Italic">Mayo</span> to find no harmful error in the appellant's separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, speculation in this court about what the Department might have done had it applied the RIF rules is foreclosed. <span class="Italic">Horne v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 684 F.2d 155 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, two career attorney-advisors in the Interstate Commerce Commission were demoted from grade GS 15 to grade GS 14 when the Commissioners for whom they had last worked departed. The RIF procedures had not been applied. The MSPB found the error harmless, for the lawyers' competitive areas might have been defined as the offices of the departing Commissioners. It was far from clear, however, that that was the definition which would have been applied had the Commission proceeded under the RIF rules. The two lawyers were longtime career employees who had worked for different Commissioners of both political parties, and there were vacancies for lawyers in grade GS 15 in the same Bureau. This court held that the discretion lodged in the Commission should be exercised by it and not by the Board or this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there were no obvious alternatives. The Board and the district court seem plainly right in concluding that the plaintiff was alone in his competitive area and competitive level. It is not a case calling for an exercise of the Department's discretion under a proper application of the RIF rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With good sense, counsel for the plaintiff disclaims any interest in a remand to the Department for a determination of the plaintiff's retention standing under the RIF rules. He wants a declaration that the procedural error made the plaintiff's release a nullity from the outset, so that he would be entitled to reinstatement and back pay without any further determination under the RIF rules. That is not the direction of <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, and the plaintiff has no right to avoid an exercise of departmental discretion if an exercise of that discretion would have been appropriate initially.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since, in this case, there was no room for the exercise of departmental discretion to come to a different conclusion under the RIF rules, we agree with the Board and the district court that the plaintiff has failed to show that the procedural error was harmful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But in<span class="Italic"> Horne v. MSPB</span>, 684 F.2d 155, 157-59 (D.C. Cir. 1982), involving demotions of two attorneys who were not subjected to RIF procedures when they should have been applied, the court to accept the agency's explanation that demotion would have occurred if RIF procedures were followed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board upheld the ICC action based on the agency's contention that a proper RIF could have achieved the same result as was achieved in this case. The central issue in this case is whether the Board could properly accept this rationale as justification for the ICC action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery,</span> 332 U.S. 194, 67 S. Ct. 1575, 91 L. Ed. 1995 (1947), the Supreme Court set forth a "simple but fundamental rule of administrative law." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 196, 67 S. Ct. at 1577.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">That rule is to the effect that a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency. If those grounds are inadequate or improper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). The rationale of this rule is clear. "If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment....&#8197;[a]n appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency." The same rationale applies when the reviewing body is an administrative tribunal rather than a court. Simply put, the Board should not be in the business of affirming administrative decisions based upon how an agency might have acted if it had followed proper procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The role of review is to evaluate agency discretion as it has been exercised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the ICC had substantial discretion to decide when to invoke a RIF and how to define a competitive area. When clearly exercised, such discretion and expertise should receive deference in review by the Board and the courts. In this case, however, the ICC never exercised its discretion. The Board adopted the <span class="Italic">de facto</span> RIF rationale after the fact, so there was nothing to which the Board could properly have deferred. The only clearly exercised act of discretion by the agency was its decision not to conduct a formal RIF--a decision that the Board found to be an error. When the Board decided that the demotions required a RIF, the Board should have remanded the case for disposition pursuant to proper procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hence, petitioners in this case had several rights that require protection through proper RIF procedures. In reviewing the ICC's action, the Board and this court must determine whether the agency deprived petitioners of those rights. But neither the Board nor this court can properly evaluate the agency's discretionary acts in conducting a RIF until that discretion has been clearly exercised. "(A) court (cannot) be expected to chisel that which must be precise from what the agency has left vague and indecisive." This rule is particularly applicable to this case where first amendment concerns are potentially involved. The petitioners should be demoted for valid reasons, or not at all. <span class="Italic">See Mt. Healthy Board of Educ. v. Doyle,</span> 429 U.S. 274, 279, 97 S. Ct. 568, 572, 50 L. Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is therefore vacated, and the case remanded to the ICC for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It is difficult to fully harmonize the cases that consider what should be done, or what should have been done, when an agency completely fails to use RIF processes when the facts called for the application of those procedures. The law is more developed when the agency uses the RIF process, but a procedural error is made. Reconstruction of the process is then the likely result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to errors in the RIF process, early RIF appeals produced mixed results. <span class="Italic">Foster v. Coast Guard</span>, 8 MSPR 240, 245 (1981), said of a competitive level determination error:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where it is possible for the Board to ascertain from the record just which positions should have been included in what it finds to have been an incorrectly defined competitive level, and, further, where its review of those positions reveals that the agency's correct definition of the competitive level would have made no difference affecting the employee's substantive rights, the agency's action in such a case will not be reversed on the basis of such an error. However, the instant case does not present that situation. On the record in this case, the Board cannot find that appellant's position was so unique as to justify a one-position competitive level. However, the record does not reveal what the proper definition of appellant's competitive level should have been. For this reason, the Board is unable to determine whether the agency would have arrived at the same decision had it correctly defined appellant's competitive level. Accordingly, the Board finds that the agency failed to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that it afforded appellant all of the rights to which she was substantively entitled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other appeals, decided in the course of compliance litigation, determined that if a competitive level was improperly constructed and an individual was <span id="Page_3111"></span>retained when the appellant, who ranked higher on a properly-constructed retention register, was separated, the RIF was reversed and the agency could not deny the appellant reinstatement on the argument that a properly run RIF would leave the appellant without a job. Because a substantive right was involved, it was immaterial that on reconstruction of the retention register for the appellant's competitive level, the agency determined that the appellant was not entitled to reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 630, 631-32 (1985); <span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> 20 MSPR 36 (1984) (same RIF; same result and reasoning as in <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question concerning the ability of the agency to defend an improper RIF action through reconstruction of the action during the appellate process may depend on what is characterized as a substantive right, <span class="Italic">Hill v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 205, 207-09 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361, 366 (1980), we held that the nature of an employee's entitlement to continued employment under 5 U.S.C. 3502(a) is determined by application of the regulations set out in the 5 C.F.R. Part 351 and that with the exception of the notice provision in Subpart H. proper application of those regulations is a substantive right, rather than a procedural requirement. Thus, these substantive rights are not subject to the harmful error standard of 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(1)(B), and the presiding official erred in utilizing a harmful error analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While in <span class="Italic">Losure,</span> the Board made clear that RIF entitlements were substantive rights and that it is the agency's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it afforded the appellant those rights, the Board subsequently explained that RIFs would not be reversed in those cases where it is shown that the agency's error in not precisely complying with the RIF regulations had no adverse effect on the employee's substantive entitlements. <span class="Italic">Foster v. Department of Transportation,</span> 7 MSPB 707 (1981). The reason for such holding is that there is a difference between technical compliance with the rules governing RIF procedures and substantive entitlements of employees. An error in application of the procedures may affect the employee's rights but in many cases, because of the presence of particular facts and circumstances, there may be no effect on substantive entitlements. Reversals in the latter cases would lead to illogical and inequitable results which would work an injustice on the federal workforce and mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Foster, supra,</span> and several cases which followed the <span class="Italic">Foster</span> analysis, were decided on the basis of whether the Board could ascertain the effect on substantive entitlements from "the record." Questions have therefore arisen with regard to the burden of proof on this issue and we therefore find it desirable to further clarify the <span class="Italic">Foster</span> holding. Because the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it afforded all rights to which an employee is substantively entitled, in cases where an issue is raised regarding an error in RIF procedures from which substantive rights are derived, the burden is on the agency to prove by preponderant evidence that such error had no adverse effect on the employee's substantive entitlements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, appellant contends that the agency's error in assigning her to a position which lasted for only two months adversely affected her substantive rights. Because the appellant has shown that an error in the RIF procedures occurred, utilizing the above analysis, we must determine whether the agency proved by preponderant evidence that such error did not adversely affect appellant's substantive entitlements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency established in the unrebutted testimony of Ms. Sandra Turner Dickett that at the time of the first RIF, there were no positions, other than the one to which appellant was assigned, which were higher than the GS-9 level. Thus, had the agency known that the GS-11 position would not last for 3 months and therefore immediately assigned appellant to a position which would last 3 months, appellant would have been assigned to a GS-9 position initially. Therefore, we find that the agency has established by preponderant evidence that appellant's substantive RIF rights were not adversely affected by the technical error in the application of 5 C.F.R. Section 351.603(a). The presiding official's change in the effective date of the first RIF was thus in error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Foster</span>, <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, and <span class="Italic">Wright</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, It is also possible that the question of whether the agency can reconstruct an action to the satisfaction of the Board depends on whether the agency offers its proof in the underlying appeal or defers that proof until compliance proceedings. The law is unclear and cases must be explored individually in an effort to find a fact pattern analogous to the case being litigated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained the relation between substantive rights and error sufficient to overturn a RIF, <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 577 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper application of the RIF regulations is a substantive right, rather than a procedural requirement. However, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 205, 207-08 (1984), that RIFs will not be reversed in those cases where it is shown that the agency's error in not precisely complying with the RIF regulations had no adverse effect on the employee's substantive entitlements. There is a difference between technical compliance with the RIF regulations and the substantive entitlements of employees. If the agency's error has no effect on the employee's substantive entitlements, the Board found, reversal of the action "would lead to illogical and inequitable results which would work an injustice on the federal workforce and mission." The burden is on the agency to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its error had no adverse effect on the employee's substantive entitlements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schroeder</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Bateman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 464, 466 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 256, 261 (1994). Although as a general principle an action may be sustained only on the basis of the grounds set forth by the agency, if separation would have been permissible if conducted as a termination action providing the employees no appeal rights, and it was improperly conducted as a RIF, the action will be sustained. <span class="Italic">Blalock v. USDA</span>, 28 MSPR 17, 24-25 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd on other grounds sub nom</span>., <span class="Italic">Huber v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986);<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 131 (1989) (no actual RIF occurred because duties before and after the reorganization were identical, but the appellant had no appeal right, other than to OPM, from a downgrading with retained pay resulting from reclassification). In the decisions that follow, reference will occasionally be made to provisions of the (now defunct) Federal Personnel Manual. Although OPM establishes RIF rules, the Board's treatment of the FPM in RIF cases is not consistent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 571 (1994) (RIF: "The FPM consists of precatory guidance to agencies by OPM on the basis of its interpretation of statutes and regulations and, while often instructive, it is not binding on agencies or the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A RIF will not be reversed if it is shown that the error by an agency in not complying precisely with RIF regulations had no adverse effect on an employee's substantive entitlements. If the error had no effect on entitlement, reversal would lead to illogical and inequitable results working an injustice on the federal workplace and mission<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Pezdek v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 554, 565 &#x00B6; 30 (1999) ("[e]ven assuming these errors were committed, the appellant has failed to show that he was harmed thereby."), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Pezdek v.

The burden of demonstrating the lack of adverse effect is on the employer. <span class="Italic">Hill v.

In <span class="Italic">Pezdek</span>, the employee was incorrectly placed into a competitive level with other individuals of different competitive levels; however, the other employees had superior assignment rights, and each competitor met specialized requirements imposed by the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA), so the appellant suffered no harm from the misconstruction of the competitive level. <span class="Italic">Pezdek, supra</span>, 80 MSPR at 560, <span class="Italic">reaff'd following court remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Pezdek v.
