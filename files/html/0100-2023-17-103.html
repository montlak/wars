<p class="noindent">5 CFR 2425.4 (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">What is prohibited. </span>Consistent with 5 CFR 2429.5, an exception may not rely on any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 CFR 2429.5 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Matters not previously presented; official notice.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will not consider any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the Regional Director, Hearing Officer, Administrative Law Judge, or arbitrator. The Authority may, however, take official notice of such matters as would be proper.</p>
<p class="noindent">A party filing an exception to an arbitration award should understand that Section 2429.5 of FLRA's regulations establish what amounts to an administrative exhaustion rule: FLRA will not consider any evidence or any issue that was not presented in the proceedings before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1637 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Seagoville</span>, 49 FLRA 125, 129 (1994) (relying on <span class="Italic">VA Nat'l Memorial Cemetery of Pac. and IAM Hawaii Fed. Lodge 1998</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1169 (1992)). Issues or arguments are expected to be developed and presented by a party so they can be recognized as such by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">VA Boston Healthcare Sys. and AFGE Local 221</span>, 68 FLRA 116, 117 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency posits that it raised this argument below by submitting both the Handbook and the VA Boston Healthcare Medical Bylaws and Rules "in its entirety" and by mentioning in its post-hearing brief that "the authority to grant clinical privileges rests with the Under Secretary of Health." However, merely submitting rules and regulations as part of the record without further explanation is not an argument. Furthermore, the Agency's post-hearing brief only mentions these submitted rules and regulations as containing "the appeal process" of a denial of privileges, which does not address either the argument raised here or how the rules and regulations specifically relate to the Arbitrator's remedial powers. Because the Agency could have made this argument to the Arbitrator but did not, it may not do so now....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Bennettsville and AFGE Local 2585</span>, 70 FLRA 342, 343 (2017) ("We find it odd that the Agency would make these arguments to the Authority, but not to the Arbitrator. The filing of exceptions is not the time to suddenly realize the rights and the duties at stake or to recognize the consequence of inaction.").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's contention that the Authority in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> should not have applied &#x00A7; 2429.5 absent a Union request to do so, the Authority's action was consistent with the above-cited precedent. <span class="Italic">See IRS</span>, 66 FLRA at 121; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 507</span>, 58 FLRA at 579. As for the Agency's reliance on its closing brief to argue that the Authority barred certain arguments that the Agency <span class="Italic">did</span> raise at arbitration, the Agency could have, but did not, submit the closing brief with its exceptions in order to demonstrate that it presented these arguments to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.4(a)(2) (stating that exceptions must "includ[e] specific references to the record...and <span class="Italic">any other relevant documentation</span>" (emphasis added)). Consequently, the Agency may not rely on the closing brief to support the motion, and, as such, the Agency provides no basis for the Authority to reconsider the dismissal of these arguments in <span class="Italic">CBP</span>. <span class="Italic">See SATCO</span>, 64 FLRA at 1143; <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency asserts that &#x00A7; 2429.5 permitted it to argue for the first time on exceptions that Section 4.F. was not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), this assertion is contrary to Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See DOJ</span>, 63 FLRA at 179-80. In <span class="Italic">CBP</span>, the Authority expressly relied on existing precedent--in particular, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>--for the proposition that, where an agency should have known to argue to an arbitrator that a contract provision was not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and the agency did not do so, the Authority will not consider that argument for the first time on exceptions to the arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">CBP</span>, 66 FLRA at 338 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 63 FLRA at 17980). In addition, since deciding <span class="Italic">CBP</span>, the Authority has continued to follow <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> holding. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Louisville Dist., Louisville, Ky.</span>, 66 FLRA 426, 428 &#x0026; n.5 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">CBP</span> and <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>). In other words, both before and after <span class="Italic">CBP</span>, the Authority has barred agency exceptions claiming that contract provisions were not enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b), where those claims were not made at arbitration. The Agency does not address <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> or claim that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> by following <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> holding. Consequently, the Agency does not provide a basis for finding that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> by barring the Agency's &#x00A7; 7106(b) argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the Authority's precedent prior to <span class="Italic">CBP</span> consistently placed a burden on unions to establish the enforceability of contract provisions under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and that the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> because it did not place a similar burden on the Union. But Authority precedent prior to <span class="Italic">CBP</span> required, as relevant here, that <span class="Italic">agencies</span> argue that an award did not enforce a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision in order to establish that the award was contrary to management rights. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wage &#x0026; Inv. Div.</span>, 66 FLRA 235, 242 (2011) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>) (where agency did not assert that award enforced provisions "not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)," agency "implicitly concede[d]" enforceability). In fact, the Authority has denied agencies' management rights exceptions even when unions filed untimely oppositions or no oppositions at all--i.e., even in cases where unions did not properly raise <span class="Italic">any</span> arguments, including &#x00A7; 7106(b) arguments, before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The decisions cited in the motion do not support a contrary conclusion.&#x2003;In this regard, the motion relies on several negotiability decisions, as well as a decision resolving exceptions to an arbitrator's finding that a proposal was within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> Motion at 11 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA at 191); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 12 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

In doing so, the motion confuses the burden that a union bears to establish that <span class="Italic">a proposal is within the duty to bargain</span> under &#x00A7; 7106(b), with the burden that an excepting party bears to establish that <span class="Italic">an arbitration award is contrary to management's rights. E.g.,</span> Motion at 12 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA II</span>, 550 F.3d at 1150 (reviewing court's application of <span class="Italic">KANG</span> in a negotiability dispute)). Negotiability decisions do not establish which party bears the burden of demonstrating that an arbitration <span id="page_1847"></span>award enforces, or does not enforce, a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116 n.9 (Authority does not apply the "tailoring" analysis from negotiability disputes when reviewing exceptions to arbitration awards). Rather, the Authority applies the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> and <span class="Italic">EPA</span> to evaluate management rights exceptions. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115; <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 106-07.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the motion's reliance on <span class="Italic">Naval Shipyard</span>, 35 FLRA at 995, the Authority did state in that decision that it would not consider a union's contention that a contract provision was enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b) because the union did not advance such an argument at arbitration. But a subsequent decision "specifically overrule[d]" that holding, and, as such, the Authority no longer follows it. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 314-15 (1990). As for the remaining decisions cited in the motion, although they do involve exceptions to arbitration awards, none states that it is a union's burden in an arbitration case to demonstrate that an award enforces a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision. <span class="Italic">See BOP II</span>, 62 FLRA at 101-02 (both parties presented arguments regarding whether award enforced a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision); <span class="Italic">SSA Birmingham</span>, 55 FLRA at 322 (despite union's failure to file opposition, Authority assessed whether it had previously found a similar provision to be a &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or (b)(3) provision); <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 53 FLRA at 170-71 (while noting that there was no claim that award enforced a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision, Authority went on to find that it was not "apparent" that provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)). Thus, these decisions do not establish that <span class="Italic">CBP</span> erroneously failed to place a burden on the Union to demonstrate that the award enforced a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the Authority in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> failed to apply &#x00A7; 2429.5 equally to both parties and that, if it had: (1) the Union would have been barred from arguing that the award enforced a &#x00A7; 7106(b) provision; and (2) the Agency's arguments that the award violated management rights would have been unrebutted. But even if the Authority in <span class="Italic">CBP</span> had barred the Union's &#x00A7; 7106(b) argument, the Authority still would have denied the Agency's management rights exceptions. Under <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, in order to show that an award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106(a), an agency must allege, as relevant here, that the award does not enforce a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 107 &#x0026; n.6. Without such an allegation, management rights exceptions fail as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See id. Accord IRS</span>, 66 FLRA at 242 (given the absence of an allegation that provisions enforced by arbitrator were "not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)," Authority denied management rights exceptions). For the reasons discussed above, the Authority correctly barred the Agency's &#x00A7; 7106(b) argument in <span class="Italic">CBP</span>. Because the Agency did not properly allege that the award enforced a contract provision that was not negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), the management rights exceptions in <span class="Italic">CBP </span>failed as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA at 107 &#x0026; n.6; <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 66 FLRA at 242. In other words, <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> required the Authority to deny the management rights exceptions in <span class="Italic">CBP</span>, regardless of whether the Union made a &#x00A7; 7106(b) argument, and regardless of whether the Authority barred such an argument under &#x00A7; 2429.5.</p>

However, the Agency failed to respond to the Union's argument or make a clear argument for a two-year statute of limitations prior to filing its exception.

<p class="noindent">To preserve FLRA's ability to adjudicate exceptions should the arbitrator improperly accept the opposing party's argument or claim, the argument presented to FLRA on exceptions to the award accepting that argument or granting the claim must first be presented to the arbitrator.

When the agency did not protect its position by raising arguments to the arbitrator, it could not then raise them with FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several of the Agency's exceptions (specified below) are premised on one claim: that the Union waited until its brief to the Arbitrator to argue that the implementation of the bonus decisions violated the Agency's obligation to bargain, and, as a result, this Union argument was not properly before the Arbitrator. However, Authority precedent supports a conclusion to the contrary. Specifically, the Authority has held that where a party does not raise an argument before the arbitrator in response to an argument first raised in an opposing party's brief to the arbitrator, and there is no basis for finding that the party was precluded from doing so, the party is barred from raising it (for the first time) before the Authority.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the Union claimed--for the first time in its brief to the Arbitrator--that the Agency violated its obligation to bargain by implementing the bonus decisions. In particular, the Union claimed that: (1) "[t]his case involves management implementing a policy that conflicts with provisions of the collective[-]bargaining agreement without allowing any negotiations over it to take place"; and (2) "[n]o opportunity to bargain over [the decisions] was afforded to the [U]nion." There also is no dispute that the Union's brief was filed with the Arbitrator over two weeks prior to issuance of the award. The Agency does not claim, and the record provides no basis for concluding, that it made any attempt during this period to rebut the Union's claim or request from the Arbitrator an opportunity to do so.</p>

In particular, we find that &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 bar the Agency's exceptions alleging that: (1) the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement because the Union's duty-to-bargain claim was not raised in accordance with the procedural requirements of the agreement; (2) the award is based on a nonfact because the Arbitrator's finding that the Union did not have an opportunity to bargain is not true; (3) the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by resolving the impact-and-implementation claim because that issue was not before the Arbitrator; (4) the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator found a bargaining obligation when the Union had waived its right to bargain by failing to request bargaining after receiving notice of the bonus decisions; and (5) the Arbitrator denied the Agency a fair hearing by considering the Union's duty-to-bargain claim without providing the Agency an opportunity to respond to that claim.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Upon review of the record in this case, it appears that Article 16 was raised for the first time in the Union's post-hearing brief to the Arbitrator, which was submitted to the Arbitrator at the same time the Agency submitted its own post-hearing brief. In this connection, there is no evidence in either the grievance or the hearing transcript that Article 16 was ever raised in the grievance or at the hearing. Specifically, the grievance alleges a violation of "Articles 3, 20, 43, and Appendix A of the labor agreement" and not Article 16. Similarly, the hearing transcript reveals that Article 16 was never mentioned by the parties, the Arbitrator, or any of the witnesses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, while the Agency may have had the opportunity to present arguments regarding the applicability of Article 16 to the Arbitrator, it had no reason to do so because Article 16 had not been raised either in the grievance or at the hearing. Having no reason to raise Article 16 prior to the issuance of the Arbitrator's award, the Agency properly raised the issue for the first time in its exceptions to the Authority. Accordingly, the Authority's factual finding that Article 16 should have been raised below was in error. In this regard, the issue of whether Article 16 applied in the present dispute arose from the issuance of the Arbitrator's award and, as such, it is not precluded by &#x00A7; 2429.5. Consequently, we grant the Agency's motion for reconsideration. Further, we consider the merits of the Agency's Article 16 claims that were not considered in <span class="Italic">DOL</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an argument raised by the agency in its exceptions is inconsistent with the arguments advanced by the agency to the arbitrator, the result may be that FLRA will not consider the argument raised in exceptions because it was not first raised with the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Broadcasting Bd. of Gov. and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 65 FLRA 830, 832 (2011); <span class="Italic">see NLRB and NLRBU</span>, 72 FLRA 334, 336 (2021) ("Under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider an argument that could have been, but was not, presented to the arbitrator. This includes arguments that differ from, or are inconsistent with, a party's arguments to the arbitrator."). If a party takes a position before the arbitrator and the arbitrator adopts that position, that party may not argue the contrary on exceptions--a kind of judicial estoppel. Of inconsistent arguments to the arbitrator and to FLRA, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 26 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 650, 652 (2012), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award fails to draw its essence from Article 11, Section 15 B of the parties' agreement. According to the Union, because that provision "explicitly states that action plans [used] in the process of modifying or <span class="Italic">occupying </span>space is a proper subject for bargaining," the Arbitrator erred in finding that Agency space is a "corporate asset" and that assigning such space is a "reserved management right." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider issues that "could have been, but were not, presented" to the arbitrator. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Trident Refit Facility, Kings Bay Ga.</span>, 65 FLRA 672, 675 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>). Where a party makes an argument before the Authority that is inconsistent with its position before the arbitrator, the Authority applies &#x00A7; 2429.5 to bar the argument. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Navy</span>, 65 FLRA at 675 (dismissing agency's contention that arbitrator exceeded his authority by failing to issue award within time required by the parties' agreement because the agency, while before the arbitrator, tacitly agreed to extend the time permitted for issuing the award);<span class="Italic"> U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Detroit, Mich.</span>, 64 FLRA 325, 328 (2009) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>) (dismissing agency's argument that parties' agreement did not incorporate certain Office of Personnel Management regulations because agency conceded before arbitrator that agreement incorporated the regulations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although, in its grievance, the Union raised violations of both Articles 11 and 15 of the parties' agreement, at the arbitration hearing, the Union expressly stated that it was only "pursuing the Article 15 issue, [and] not the Article 11 issue[.]" In addition, the parties stipulated that the only contractual issue before the Arbitrator was whether the Agency violated Article 15 of the parties' agreement. In its exceptions, the Union now challenges the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 11, including his conclusion that the provision does not apply in this case. The Union's argument is inconsistent with the position that it took before the Arbitrator--i.e., that Article 11 was not before the Arbitrator and, hence, was not involved in the resolution of this matter. Consequently, the Union's exception is not properly before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Navy</span>, 65 FLRA at 675; <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 328.</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA is demanding that issues be specifically addressed to the arbitrator to warrant review through exceptions. In a case involving cancelation of overtime assignments with less than seven days of notice, in alleged violation of a contract article, the agency argued to the arbitrator that interpretation and application of the contract article violated the management right to assign work. Before FLRA, the agency made the same argument but added that the award violated the management right to assign and direct employees and to take actions necessary to carry out the agency mission during emergencies. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 65 FLRA 171, 172 (2010), declined to entertain the latter exceptions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations that were in effect when the Agency filed its exceptions provided that "[t]he Authority will not consider...any issue, which was not presented in the proceedings before the...arbitrator." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5. Before the Arbitrator, the Agency argued that to interpret Section 8 to allow cancellation of overtime with less than seven days' notice only when employees return from scheduled leave would excessively interfere with management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). There is no indication in the record that the Agency argued to the Arbitrator that such an interpretation of Section 8 would also conflict with &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (D) and &#x00A7; 7101. As these issues could have been, but were not, presented to the Arbitrator, &#x00A7; 2429.5 precludes the Agency from raising them for the first time in exceptions. Accordingly, we dismiss these exceptions.</p>

There is no indication in the record that the Union advised the Arbitrator of the requirements of Article 32, Section g. or that the Union raised objections to the Arbitrator with respect to the time limit provided in Article 32. Furthermore, the documents submitted by the Union with the exceptions demonstrate that it was aware of, and acquiesced to, the Arbitrator's request for additional time to prepare and issue her decision. Because the Union could have raised these arguments before the Arbitrator, but failed to do so, we dismiss the Union's exceeds-authority exception under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5.</p>

<p class="noindent">The exhaustion rule applies when FLRA remands a case for consideration of a remedy, the arbitrator fashions a remedy based on submissions by the union, but the agency offers no submission during the remand to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Nat'l Council of HUD Locals 222</span>, 66 FLRA 867, 868-69 (2012) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 69 FLRA 60 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), <span class="Italic">Local 222 decisions vacated</span>, <span class="Italic">HUD and AFGE Local 222</span>, 70 FLRA 605 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., <span class="Italic">DHUD and HUD Local 222</span>, 71 FLRA 17 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting))); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 66 FLRA 913, 915 (2012) (remedial claim for compensatory damages asserted with FLRA was barred because it was not presented to arbitrator).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations that were in effect when the Agency filed its exceptions provided that "[t]he Authority will not consider...any issue, which was not presented in the proceedings before the...arbitrator." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Arbitrator framed the issue as whether the Agency violated the parties' agreement by selecting employee A for the senior position. The Union raised this allegation in its grievance. Moreover, in its grievance, the Union requested that the Agency vacate the selection if the selection was made in violation of the parties' agreement. The Union requested similar relief at the hearing. Thus, the Agency was aware that the Union was: (1) challenging the Agency's selection of employee A; and (2) seeking to vacate this selection. The Agency, therefore, had the opportunity to argue to the Arbitrator that the award could violate management's right to select by "affect[ing] the determination of whether applicants possess the requisite qualifications, skills and abilities[.]" However, the record contains no indication that this argument was presented below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Agency had an opportunity to argue to the Arbitrator that, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute, the Arbitrator was required to defer to the specialist's examination of employee A's qualifications and her interpretation of the announcement. The specialist was the Agency's witness. The record contains no indication, however, that the Agency argued at the hearing that the Arbitrator should defer to the specialist's testimony. Likewise, although the parties' filed post-hearing briefs, the record contains no indication that the Agency argued that a failure to defer to the specialist's testimony would excessively interfere with management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the foregoing issues could have been, but were not, presented to the Arbitrator, we find that &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations precludes the Agency from raising them for the first time in its exceptions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, Newark, N.J., </span>64 FLRA 259, 260-61 (2009) (citations omitted) (Authority dismissed agency's argument that award violated management's right to select because agency failed to present argument below).

<p class="noindent">Arguments to an arbitrator by an agency were deemed insufficiently specific to preserve for exceptions a management rights objection, <span class="Italic">SSA Fredericksburg and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 65 FLRA 946, 948 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case law interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5 makes clear that the Authority will not consider a contention that could have been, but was not, presented to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Robins Air Force Base, Ga., </span>59 FLRA 542, 544 (2003). Here, the Agency's argument before the Arbitrator, that it followed all the rules, laws and regulations regarding the grievant's performance rating, is too general to sufficiently preserve its claims that its rating of the grievant was (1) an exercise of its management rights to direct employees and assign work under the Statute and (2) consistent with Article 3's requirement that employees be treated fairly and equitably in personnel management matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Minot Air Force Base, N.D., </span>61 FLRA 366, 369 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting as to another matter) (internal quotations and citation omitted) (management rights exception dismissed under &#x00A7; 2429.5 because Agency assertion before the arbitrator that the action it took was to "ensure the safety of the crews and the protection of Air Force equipment" was insufficient to preserve ability to raise management rights claims before the Authority).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 164 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP Oroville</span>, 65 FLRA 901, 904 (2011), provides another example of close scrutiny of what a party should have, but did not, raise with the arbitrator, resulting in denial of exceptions involving a question of statutory application:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the supplemental award, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency's collective day shift proposal was in compliance with the initial award, the agreement, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3). In reaching this conclusion, the Arbitrator found that the statutory exception to the scheduling requirements applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's primary exception to the supplemental award is that the Arbitrator misconstrued &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)'s statutory exception when he applied it in this case. However, there is no indication in the record that the Union argued before the Arbitrator, as it does here, that the single statutory exception set forth in &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) does not apply, even though the Union had the opportunity to do so. The Union cited &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) in the clarification petition. Specifically, the Union cited subparts (A) and (C) of &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) as support for its position that the Agency's collective day shift proposal violates both &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and the initial award. Therefore, the Union was sufficiently aware of &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)'s provisions to have been able to make the corollary argument that &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)'s single statutory exception is inapplicable to the facts of this case. Because the Union did not present an argument to the Arbitrator that the statutory exception does not apply, we find that &#x00A7; 2429.5 bars the Union from raising it before the Authority. Consequently, we dismiss the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union that failed to properly brief or argue to the arbitrator issues pertaining to counsel fee entitlement would not be heard by FLRA as to the arguments that could earlier have been made, <span class="Italic">FOP Pentagon Police Labor Comm. and DOD, Pentagon Force Protection Agency</span>, 65 FLRA 781, 783-84 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5, the Authority will not consider "any evidence, factual assertions, arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the...arbitrator." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., JFK Airport, Queens, N.Y., </span>62 FLRA 416, 417 (2008) (exception dismissed under &#x00A7; 2429.5, where record established agency could have made argument before arbitrator but did not); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.4(c) (expressly prohibits <span id="page_1850"></span>exceptions from including "arguments (including affirmative defenses), requested remedies, or challenges to an awarded remedy that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication in the record that the Union argued to the Arbitrator, as it does in its exceptions, that fees were warranted in the interest of justice because <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criteria 2, 4, and 5 were satisfied. To the contrary, the Arbitrator found that, although the Union requested attorney fees, it failed to "point to any specific criterion" that it believed was satisfied and "ma[de] no argument" regarding why fees should be awarded.<span class="Italic"> </span>Because the Union could have, but did not, raise such arguments before the Arbitrator, it may not do so now.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because it is contrary to Executive Order 12,564, which shields employees from disciplinary action for drug use only if they admit to such misconduct before being identified through other means. However, there is no evidence that the Agency advanced this argument before the Arbitrator. The Agency asserts that, at arbitration, it entered into evidence Handbook 5383, which contains "citations to Executive Order 12,564 and its implementing legislation." However, merely citing a law or regulation before an arbitrator does not thereby raise related arguments.[9] Accordingly, we find that the Agency failed to sufficiently raise its argument regarding Executive Order 12,564 before the Arbitrator, and we dismiss this exception under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.4(c) and 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations.</p>

<p class="noindent">With exceptions concerning arguments that could not have been presented to an arbitrator prior to an award and concerning limited jurisdictional, sovereign immunity, and constitutional issues, discussed below, FLRA enforces the rule that if an issue was not placed before the arbitrator, FLRA is not going to consider the issue on exceptions.

<p class="noindent">Most significantly and most frequently, the rule that issues must be raised with the arbitrator if they are to be considered on exceptions by FLRA relates to claims that an award, on matters of substantive interpretation and application of the contract, as well as the remedy ordered by an award, violates management rights. <span class="Italic">See SSA Newark and AFGE Local 2369,</span> 64 FLRA 259, 260 (2009); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 68</span>, 63 FLRA 202, 205 (2009) ("Therefore, as the issue concerning management rights could have been, but was not, raised or presented to the Arbitrator, the issue is not properly before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See CBP,</span> 62 FLRA at 417.

The Agency argues that the award, by requiring it 'to permit employees to engage in fitness activities rather than other duties' violates its right to assign work. However, there is no indication in the award or the Agency's post-hearing brief that this argument was made before the Arbitrator. The record establishes that the Agency could have made this argument below, as the Union specifically requested as a remedy that the Arbitrator direct the Agency 'to make the HIP program available to the Union's CBPOE's to include up to three hours a week for exercise and facilities in which to perform that exercise.' As the issue concerning management rights could have been, but was not, raised below, the issue is not properly before the Authority.

<p class="noindent">It matters not that the arguments are legal rather than factual, e.g., that they involve substantive entitlement to compensation under the Back Pay Act. If they are not raised with the arbitrator, they will not be considered by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 64 FLRA 810, 811-12 (2010) (agency failed to argue to the arbitrator applicability of statute of limitations in FLSA case), <span class="Italic">recons. den.,</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 65 FLRA 256 (2010); <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3509,</span> 63 FLRA 661, 662 (2009) (agency could not raise first with FLRA issue of whether grievant was entitled to reasonable accommodation under Rehabilitation Act when arbitrator framed issue as contract violation involving clause calling for accommodations for qualified employees with disabilities); <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oakdale and AFGE Local 3957</span>, 63 FLRA 178, 179-80 (2009) (agency failed to raise with arbitrator issue of whether implementation of contract provision violated management rights under 5 USC 7106(a)); <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric.

<p class="noindent">An argument that a monetary remedy is contrary to the doctrine of sovereign immunity is not going to result in reconsideration if the argument really goes to the extent of a remedy that was within the arbitrator's authority to grant, the situation in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Atwater and AFGE Local 1242</span>, 65 FLRA 256, 257-58 (2010), involving a dispute over whether a two or three-year limitation period governed an award of FLSA backpay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we deny the Agency's motion for reconsideration based on the doctrine of sovereign immunity. A claim of federal sovereign immunity can be raised at any time. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 61 FLRA 146, 151 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army v.

Cir. 2005) (sovereign immunity is a matter of "jurisdiction and may properly be raised at any time")). It is clear that a federal agency is subject to a monetary claim only if the statute on which the claim is based unambiguously establishes a waiver of sovereign immunity permitting such claim. <span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency concedes that the FLSA constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity, but argues that the requirements warranting a three-year statute of limitations under the FLSA were not met. Thus, the Agency's claim that the award contravenes the doctrine of sovereign immunity is merely a restatement of its claim that the Arbitrator erroneously applied the three-year statute of limitations under the FLSA--an issue that the Authority found untimely raised in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Atwater</span>. The Agency has not provided any reason for us to reconsider the dismissal of the Agency's claim regarding the three-year statute of limitations issue. Moreover, the award is based on the FLSA and the FLSA provides a valid waiver of sovereign immunity. We therefore reject the Agency's contention that reconsideration is warranted because the award violates the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an issue is raised in a post-hearing brief, and if the argument is clearly related to the issue before the arbitrator, FLRA will consider that issue through exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODEA and FEA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-057.html">60 FLRA 254</a> (2004) (issue of extent of backpay award raised in the agency's posthearing brief); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Atlanta and NTEU Chap. 26</span>, 44 FLRA 622, 625 (1992) (argument properly before FLRA that was made in union's posthearing brief); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the Union's assertion, there is no indication in the award or elsewhere in the record that the Agency argued before the Arbitrator, as it does in its exceptions, that the position description relied on by the Arbitrator was not in existence during the time frames the grievants claimed to have performed GS-11 work. In fact, as the Union points out, the Agency specifically relied in its post-hearing brief to the Arbitrator on the GS-11 position description it now claims was abolished. The Agency's argument could, and should, have been presented to the Arbitrator and, as a result, we refuse to consider the Agency's argument for the first time on exception<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 55 FLRA 366 (1999). The Agency's arguments that the award is contrary to the Back Pay Act and &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute are based on its contention that the Arbitrator improperly <span id="page_1851"></span>relied on an abolished position description. Accordingly, we also do not consider these exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA allows exceptions to be raised if arguments were not first raised with the arbitrator because, essentially, the arbitrator created the difficulty addressed by the exception, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oakdale and AFGE Local 1007</span>, 65 FLRA 35, 38 (2010):</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that the Agency was on notice that the Union raised the temporary promotion issue before the Arbitrator.&#x2003;The grievance clearly alleged a violation of the 2004 settlement agreement and requested backpay, thereby putting the Agency on notice that it should have made the argument that it now makes in its exceptions. Despite this notice, the record contains no indication that the Agency ever argued to the Arbitrator that the settlement agreement does not establish an Agency policy mandating compensation for the temporary performance of higher-graded duties; rather, the Agency claimed only that: (1) the requested remedy of temporary promotion would exceed 120 days, in violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(1)(i); (2) the work assigned to the Counselors was not, in fact, higher-graded; and (3) the extent of the extra duties performed by Counselors was <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency did not present to the Arbitrator its argument regarding the lack of a nondiscretionary Agency policy regarding compensation for the temporary performance of higher-graded duties, it may not do so now.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency contends that this issue was not raised at any time before the Arbitrator and that, therefore, the Authority should not consider the issue as a basis for finding the award deficient. We will consider the Union's contention that the award is contrary to law and regulation. In our view, this claim presents the issue of whether the award is deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute. Such an issue is not precluded under section 2429.5 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations because it is an issue that arose only after the Arbitrator issued his award and could not have been presented to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Polk, Louisiana and National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-168,</span> 44 FLRA 1548, 1566 (1992).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Before the Arbitrator, the Union argued that the Agency violated the MOU by allowing individuals other than the Deciding Official to take various actions, including approving awards. Thus, the Agency could have argued to the Arbitrator that interpreting the MOU in this manner would be contrary to management's right to assign work. However, there is no evidence in the record that the Agency did so. Accordingly, under &#x00A7; 2429.5, we dismiss the Agency's exception alleging that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the MOU is contrary to management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By contrast, it is unclear whether the Agency could have raised, before the Arbitrator, its management-rights challenge to the Arbitrator's chosen remedy. In this connection, the Arbitrator expressly declined to award the remedy requested by the Union and, instead, awarded a different remedy. As there is no basis in the record for finding that the Agency could have raised to the Arbitrator its management-rights argument regarding the awarded remedy, we do not apply &#x00A7; 2429.5 to bar that argument. <span class="Italic">Cf.

We, therefore, grant the Union's motion to strike, and we have not considered the opinion of the Agency's personnel staffing specialist. However, we will consider the Agency's arguments that the grievant was not qualified for promotion under the applicable civil service qualification standards. In our view, these arguments present the issue of whether the award is deficient on any grounds set forth in section 7122(a) of the Statute. Such an issue is not precluded under section 2429.5 because it is an issue that arose only after the Arbitrator issued his award and could not have been presented to the Arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 406.

<p class="noindent">Continuing to trace the lineage of the exception to the rule that arguments must first be presented to an arbitrator if they are to be consider on exceptions, <span class="Italic">SBA and AFGE Council 228, Local 2532</span>, 38 FLRA 386, 405-06 (1990), stated as to a settlement agreement challenged on the basis of its validity as a matter of law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's claim that the Agency's arguments on the validity of the settlement agreement cannot be considered by the Authority because they were never presented to the Arbitrator. The Union has misconstrued the meaning of the term "issue" in section 2429.5, as it applies to exceptions to arbitration awards under section 7122(a) of the Statute. In our view, the issue presented by the Agency in its exceptions is whether the arbitration award is deficient on any of the grounds set forth in section 7122(a) of the Statute. This issue cannot be precluded under section 2429.5 because it is not an issue that could have been presented to the Arbitrator. Instead, it is an issue that arose only after the Arbitrator issued his award. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force, Kirtland Air Force Base and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2263, AFL-CIO,</span> 19 FLRA 260, 260 n.1 (1985) (the Authority rejected the union's contention that the Agency's exceptions should be dismissed because they raise new issues not raised before the Arbitrator; the Authority concluded that the Agency appropriately raised for resolution by the Authority the issue of whether the award is deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute). Accordingly, we will consider the Agency's arguments that the award is deficient because the settlement agreement was void.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Kirtland AFB and AFGE Local 2263</span>, 19 FLRA 260, 260 n.1 (1985), referenced in <span class="Italic">SBA, supra</span>, involving an agency's challenge under the Back Pay Act to the arbitrator's direction to restore some leave, noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1852"></span>In its opposition the Union contends that the Agency's exceptions should be dismissed because they raise new issues not raised before the Arbitrator. However, the Authority finds no basis for dismissing the exceptions. The Agency has appropriately and timely raised for resolution by the Authority the issue of whether the award is deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some additional insight into FLRA's line of decisions is provided by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, SUPSHIP and NAGE Local R5-125</span>, 57 FLRA 744, 745 (2002), noting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider issues that could have been, but were "not presented in the proceedings before the...arbitrator." However, where an issue arises from the issuance of the award and could not have been presented to the arbitrator, it is not precluded by &#x00A7; 2429.5. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Agric., Animal &#x0026; Plant Health Inspection Serv., Plant Prot. &#x0026; Quarantine</span>, 57 FLRA 4, 5 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's essence arguments are based on the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement. These arguments arise from the award itself and, thus, the Agency would have had no basis for raising these arguments prior to issuance of the award. Accordingly,<span class="Italic"> </span>&#x00A7; 2429.5 does not preclude the Agency from raising its essence arguments here, and we will address those arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and LIUNA Local 1376</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-045.html">60 FLRA 202</a>, 209 (2004), provides a fragment more of indirect guidance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Authority should not consider the Agency's arguments regarding the Fifth Amendment because those arguments were not raised before the Arbitrator. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5, the Authority will not consider any argument that could have been, but was not, raised before the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Pascagoula, Miss.,</span> 57 FLRA 744, 745 (2002). However, where an issue arises from the issuance of the award and could not have been presented to the arbitrator, it is not precluded by &#x00A7; 2429.5. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency made arguments regarding a Fifth Amendment property interest--but not a liberty interest--before the Arbitrator. However, in the circumstances of this case, there is no basis for concluding that the Agency should have known that the Union was making a liberty argument, separate from a property argument. In this connection, the stipulated issues involved "the Fifth Amendment[&#8197;]," without further specification. Further, the Union's opening statement at the hearing did not specify whether the vested interest was a liberty or property interest. Although the Union's post-hearing brief included separate arguments regarding liberty and property, that brief was submitted after the Agency submitted its post-hearing brief. Moreover, the Arbitrator stated during the hearing that he would not permit reply briefs, so the Agency had no opportunity to respond to the Union's liberty argument. In these circumstances, we address the merits of the Agency's Fifth Amendment exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters Local F-89 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Sam Houston</span>, 50 FLRA
327, 328-29 (1995), declined to consider exceptions raising the
failure of an arbitrator to consider an award of compensatory damages and counsel fees. Those matters were not first presented to the arbitrator. FLRA noted that the union could still submit a counsel fee request to the arbitrator, since a party may file a request for counsel fees within a reasonable time following the award (and FLRA's decision on the exceptions).
