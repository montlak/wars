<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-146"><span class="space">c.</span> Grievance Proceeding</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Lacking gross insubordination or threats of physical harm, an employee generally may not be discharged for rude or impertinent behavior in the course of a grievance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 194 n.3 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Leveritt v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 5 MSPR 168, 172, 5 MSPB 224 (1981)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 607, 616 (1996) (issue was raised but not decided of whether a whistleblower loses protection when his methods of conveying protected information are unduly confrontational). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Perkins v. United States</span>, 174 Ct. Cl. 124 (1966) (sustaining removal for disrespectful language used to a supervisor in a letter that was related to but "not a necessary part of a grievance proceeding."); <span class="Italic">Keyton v. Anderson</span>, 229 F.2d 519, 520 (D.C. Cir. 1956) ("[T]he right to file a grievance does not carry with it the privilege of including false and unfounded charges, defamatory in nature."); <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, 111 MSPR 5, 9-10 &#x00B6; 10, 2008 MSPB 249 (2008) ("higher threshold" exception to insubordination rule did not apply to appellant, whose failure to follow instructions did not occur over the course of presenting a grievance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The protection provided to statements made in grievance proceedings was summarized, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 673, 679 &#x00B6; 11, 2011 MSPB 35 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's first contention, he is correct that certain intemperate employee comments, that would otherwise support disciplinary action, will not support disciplinary action if made in certain emotional, confrontational contexts, such as the grievance process or the equal employment opportunity counseling process. <span class="Italic">See Daigle v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 625, 628 (1999) (EEO counseling); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 161, 175-76 (1996) (grievance process). In the absence of gross insubordination or threats of physical harm, an employee generally cannot be discharged for rude or impertinent conduct in the course of presenting grievances. <span class="Italic">See Nielson</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 161, 175-76.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no protection for a knowingly false and malicious statement made in the course of union representation. <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Dept. of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 243, 245-47 (1984). Belligerent and offensive conduct at a grievance meeting by an employee (the grievant) toward his supervisor is unprotected under the labor relations laws and constitutes insubordination. Although employees generally may not be discharged for rude or impertinent conduct in the course of presenting grievances, the protections do not extend to gross insubordination or threats of physical harm. <span class="Italic">Farris v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 568, 574, 13 MSPB 200 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hanner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 677, 687 (1994) (sustaining the dismissal of a union representative for failing to follow leave-requesting procedures, being AWOL, and causing a disturbance outside his assigned work site; the "flagrant misconduct" rule, <span class="Italic">post</span>, was not discussed in the MSPB decision). <span class="Italic">Farris</span> reduced a removal to a 45-day suspension for an employee fired for both behaving belligerently at a grievance meeting and handing out a flyer critical of management. The distribution of the pamphlet was protected speech. The grievance meeting would not have occurred had the agency not imposed disciplinary action for the protected speech. Given <span id="Page_2617"></span>the absence of a table of penalties and the failure of the agency to specify whether it would have removed the appellant for one charge rather than the combination of charges, the Board mitigated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the use or abuse of the grievance process <span class="Italic">SSA v. Burris</span>, 39 MSPR 51, 57-59 (1988), involving removal of an ALJ, stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Count Two, the agency charged the respondent with "malicious use of the HHS grievance procedures." It charged that the respondent filed an inordinate number of ill-founded grievances which harassed the agency, and that he did so in order to make outrageously vituperative attacks against his supervisors and other management officials....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that only in the most extraordinary case will statements made in grievances, or the filing of grievances, be found to constitute a proper basis for disciplining an employee. In fact, we have previously observed that "[t]he case law in this area is clear that, in [the] absence of gross insubordination or threats of physical harm, an employee may generally not be discharged for rude or impertinent conduct in the course of presenting grievances." <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. Department of Army</span>, 22 MSPR 190, 194 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The law in this area is protective of the grievant's rights because, under 5 USC 2302(b)(9), a section of which has consistently been interpreted to apply to the filing of grievances, it is a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee for the exercise of an appeal right....&#8197;In addition, the law is protective of those rights in order to insure the efficacy of appeals processes created in furtherance of the public interest....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the protections afforded to the filing of grievances and to statements made within them are not absolute. We have found that where there has been abusive behavior during grievance hearings and where actions have been taken in bad faith, an employee may be disciplined for grievance-related conduct under the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">Farris v. US Postal Service</span>, 13 MSPB 200, 14 MSPR 568 (1983)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the 26 months following respondent's replacement as acting ALJIC, he filed approximately 100 grievances, totaling more than 2,000 pages. These massive filings placed a heavy burden on those responsible for processing his grievances. This burden was unreasonable because the respondent filed frivolous grievances and grievances on matters for which, even if valid, he sought no personal relief. Rather than seeking to obtain redress, the respondent used the grievance system as an additional route for "getting even" with those people he held responsible for removing him from the acting ALJIC position he temporarily occupied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the respondent repeatedly insulted the integrity, intelligence and character of his supervisors and management officials in those grievances. In fact, we are persuaded that the respondent filed these grievances in order to obtain a forum in which to cast aspersions and make derogatory comments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The multitude of ill-founded grievances and the excesses contained in them reflect that the appellant's motives were to insult and harass others. Under the circumstances presented here, we find that the agency has established that respondent committed outrageous and sufficiently flagrant abuses of the grievance process to warrant the imposition of discipline under the good cause standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent contends that discipline cannot be imposed upon him for what he said in the grievances because the agency did not establish, or even attempt to establish, that his insulting comments were untrue. In making this argument, however, the respondent misunderstands the nature of that portion of the charge which relates to his use of abusive language. The truth or falsity of his outlandish characterizations was not at issue. The agency did not ask permission to discipline the respondent for lying, and thus did not need to establish that he was.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, the agency sought permission to discipline respondent for misusing the grievance system. And, in that regard, the agency had to, and did, establish that the respondent improperly used the system as a forum for hurling invectives rather than, as the regulations intended, a forum for obtaining personal relief in the form of specific remedies which would directly benefit him. 5 CFR 771.202.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Less impertinent behavior did not strip the employee of the right to avoid reprisal while filing a grievance, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Nielson</span>, 71 MSPR 161, 175-76 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In ruling that the SC had not met its burden of proving that Cruse's protected conduct was a significant factor that led to his termination, the ALJ also relied on Nielson's testimony that one of the reasons that he fired Cruse was the confrontational attitude Cruse displayed when he told Nielson that he was going to consult with the personnel office about his performance evaluation and his action of challenging Nielson to fire him. We agree that Cruse exhibited a confrontational attitude towards Nielson immediately before he was fired. Specifically, Cruse rejected his immediate supervisor's offer to inform Nielson that he was going to the personnel office to file a complaint about his rating. He insisted on informing Nielson of this fact himself, and during the confrontation that followed, he essentially dared Nielson to fire him. As a matter of law, however, we cannot agree with the ALJ's implicit legal conclusion that the confrontational attitude that Cruse displayed when he exercised his rights under section 2302(b)(9) was a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason that justified Nielson's action of firing him and stripped Cruse of protection under 2302(b)(9). The Board has previously recognized that:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Cruse's conduct was confrontational, it was not the type of abusive or disruptive behavior that falls outside the protection of section 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See Burris,</span> 39 MSPR at 59 (agency had good cause to remove administrative law judge who used the grievance system as a forum for hurling invectives at his supervisors and management officials, repeatedly insulting their integrity, intelligence, and character); <span class="Italic">Farris v. United States Postal Service</span>, 13 MSPB 200, 14 MSPR 568, 571 (1983) (finding unprotected the following conduct which occurred during a grievance meeting: appellant's actions of calling a management official a "pompous ass"; telling a management official he would "ruin" him and that he could knock him to the ground and stomp his teeth out, but would not do so). Thus, we find that Cruse's confrontational behavior towards the respondent, which occurred when Cruse announced his intent to grieve the handling of his performance evaluation, did not strip him of protection under section 2302(b)(9) or constitute a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for Nielson's action of firing him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Guidance on conduct during grievance sessions may also be taken from the unfair labor practice case law of the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the National Labor Relations Board. Consider a few holdings of the FLRA and its administrative law judges. An employee's right to engage in protected activity permits leeway for impulsive behavior, to be balanced against the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the job site. To remove the conduct from the ambit of protected activity, the employee must be found to have engaged in flagrant misconduct. The same protection extends to union representatives and employees who participate in grievance proceedings. The statement "take the job and shove it" was not considered flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 6 FLRA 96, 97 (1981) (ALJ Decision). The reason is that an employee who is also a union official acting in an official capacity as a union official is entitled to greater latitude in speech and action. The protection extends to strong, vigorous representation and robust debate on behalf of the union. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Bath, New York and AFGE Local 491</span>, 12 FLRA 552 (1983). A steward who called her supervisor a fool in the course of representing another employee was not guilty of flagrant misconduct. There was no disruption to the job site. A degree of disrespect for the supervisor was balanced against the supervisor's somewhat foolish actions in treating the employee who was being represented. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 16 FLRA 687 (1984) (ALJ Decision). [Refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Labor Relations Authority Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/flraguide">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2022).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Flagrant misconduct by an employee, though occurring during the course of protected activity, may justify disciplinary action by an employer. But the use of vulgarity by a union official during a meeting with management over a grievance was not flagrant misconduct; management representatives used equally vulgar language in the presence of their employees. The references during the grievance meeting by the union official to the management representative as a racist, sexist, and ageist, although inherently inflammatory, were related to the grievant's concerns that her supervisor had been discriminating against her. Although indelicate and intemperate language in the conduct of labor-management relations is not condoned, the statements, representing views concerning the merits of a grievance, were not flagrant misconduct. A letter of reprimand based on those statements was an unfair labor practice. It interfered with protected rights in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">DHUD, San Francisco Area Office and NFFE Local 1450</span>, 4 FLRA 460 (1980) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The factors to be considered in determining what constitutes protected speech during grievance meetings include: (1) the place and the subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's outburst was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the outburst was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language and conduct. Telling a supervisor to get screwed was unprotected speech when there was no provocation, the employee was earlier warned against use of that type of language, and the language was not pertinent to the subject of discussion. There is leeway for emotional speech during a grievance proceeding, but the employee went too far. <span class="Italic">DMA Aerospace Ctr. and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 17 FLRA 71 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Meehan v. Macy</span>, 392 F.2d 822, 837 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (status as a union official was not a license to engage in unbridled speech critical of the agency and potentially disruptive to it; however, "Government officials seeking to inhibit freedom <span id="Page_2618"></span>of speech of Government employees have a responsibility to be reasonably specific if they intend that freedom to be inhibited by an order"), <span class="Italic">remanded for further analysis under Pickering v. Bd. of Educ.</span>, 425 F.2d 469 (1968) and 425 F.2d 472 (1969) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a grievance proceeding is not an audience conditionally granted by a master to his servants but is instead a meeting of equals, discipline was warranted when, at a group grievance session, a union steward refused to obey ground rules calling for people to allow each other to speak without demeaning one another. The steward was not attempting to voice his convictions about a particular grievance or problem; rather, he voiced unfocused rebelliousness and unwillingness to be subject to any rules of disciplined discourse. The ALJ announced his rationale for finding the conduct by the steward unprotected in <span class="Italic">DLA, Defense Depot Tracy and Laborers' Int'l Union, Local 1276</span>, 16 FLRA 703, 715 (1984) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Particularly in the light of there being no rational discussion of either a grievance or its manner of presentation underway, and no semblance of provocation, or other mitigating factors, his conduct was in the circumstances indefensible. The reasons for the doctrine which affords employees broad latitude in grievance discussions are absent here, and the facts are in essence closer to garden-variety insubordination on the plant floor. The Union's right to be represented at such formal discussions was therefore forfeited....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there is leeway for conduct that might otherwise be considered insubordinate during the course of grievance meetings, an employee may be removed for insubordination during a confrontation with a supervisor that the employee wrongly believes constitutes a grievance meeting or formal discussion within the meaning of the federal labor laws. <span class="Italic">Wiggins v. Nat'l Gallery of Art</span>, 980 F.2d 1436, 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (concluding that "ridicule of a superior and defiant disobedience by a member of a security guard undermines the achievement of the objectives of security operations and is intolerable").</p>
