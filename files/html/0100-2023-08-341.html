<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-333"><span class="space">a.</span> Postal Service</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA covers Postal Service employees, <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 48, 50-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with the agency's argument that, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that an internal applicant in the <span class="Italic">competitive service</span> is entitled to veterans' preference when participating in an open competitive examination process, such a rule would not apply to the <span class="Italic">Postal Service</span> because it is exempt from the rules applicable to the competitive service. It is true that the Postal Service is generally exempt from the provisions of title 5, including the provisions pertaining to the competitive service. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 410(a). Under 39 <span id="Page_606"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), however, "[t]he provisions of title 5 <span class="Italic">relating to a preference eligible...</span>shall apply to an applicant for appointment and any officer or employee of the Postal Service in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the applicant, officer, or employee were subject to the competitive service under such title...." (Emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2) does not apply to intra-agency appointments, like the ones at issue here, since it covers only "preference at <span class="Italic">employment</span>, rights to challenge adverse actions, and seniority rights during layoffs." ARPR at 7 (quoting <span class="Italic">Glenn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 939 F.2d 1516, 1521 (11th Cir. 1991)) (emphasis added). The agency is apparently construing the term "employment" as pertaining only to hiring from outside the agency, i.e., to external applicants, rather than internal applicants. Regardless how "employment," as used in <span class="Italic">Glenn</span>, should be interpreted, we find that 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2) is clear on its face, and unambiguously covers the appellant, as "an applicant for appointment and any officer or employee of the Postal Service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting the scope of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), the Board has consistently considered whether the particular right or benefit at issue is covered by the Veterans' Preference Act, as amended. <span class="Italic">Gribcheck v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 473 &#x00B6; 13 (2001). The title 5 provisions at issue here--5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309, 3313, granting additional veterans' preference points in competitive examinations--are covered by the Veterans' Preference Act, as amended. <span class="Italic">See Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208 &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Abrahamsen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 377 (2003). They are thus "provisions of title 5 relating to a preference eligible," within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), and therefore apply to the appellant, as "an applicant for appointment...or employee of the Postal Service in the same manner and under the same conditions as if [he] were subject to the competitive service." 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, pursuant to 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), preference-eligible <span class="Italic">Postal</span> employees, like the appellant, are entitled to the same veterans' preference under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309, 3313 as preference-eligible <span class="Italic">competitive-service</span> employees, and the question simply becomes whether an internal applicant for a vacancy in the same agency is entitled to veterans' preference when participating in a competitive examination process under which external applicants are given veterans' preference. For the reasons discussed below, we answer this question in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lis v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 415, 417-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 8-11, 2010 MSPB 54 (2010), confirmed VEOA coverage for preference eligible Postal Service employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to his removal, the appellant, a 10-point preference eligible veteran, was employed as a Mail Processing Clerk at the Eau Claire Processing and Distribution (P&#x0026;DF) facility in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. By letter dated October 25, 2006, he notified the agency that he had taken the "custodian test" and wished to be placed on the register for a custodian position at the facility. The following month, the agency informed the appellant that he was eligible for a Laborer Custodian position and had been placed on the register, with 10 preference points added to his examination score.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency subsequently filled the custodian positions at the Eau Claire P&#x0026;DF through internal reassignment, rather than open competitive procedures. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement with the American Postal Workers Union, applicants for vacant custodian positions at Eau Claire are considered in the following order: (1) custodians within the facility; (2) maintenance craft employees throughout the agency; (3) out-of-craft employees within the facility; (4) out-of-craft employees outside the facility; and (5) non-postal employees. Because custodial positions are lowest within the maintenance craft, there is no promotion register. Within each category, letters of interest are considered in the order of receipt, without regard to test scores or veterans' preference. Thus, the appellant, a member of category (3), was given lower priority than maintenance craft employees, in-house or elsewhere in the agency, as well as in-house, out-of-craft employees whose letters of interest were submitted before his. In addition, the agency deemed the appellant's application to have expired after 1 year, although the appellant contends that his application should have remained active for at least 2 years, as indicated on the notice of his placement on the register, and that certain other employees were hired to custodial positions more than 1 year after they applied. In any event, the agency concedes that the appellant was never considered for a custodian position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this case for the purpose of correcting the AJ's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's VEOA claim. To establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal based on an alleged violation of veterans' preference rights, an appellant must: (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL; and (2) make non-frivolous allegations that (a) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of VEOA, (b) the action at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment of VEOA, and (c) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference.[3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Haasz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 6 (2008); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Defense,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 7 (2007). Preference eligible employees in the Postal Service are entitled to the same veterans' preference rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3309 and 3313 as preference eligible competitive service employees. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 8 (2005). An appellant need not state a claim upon which relief can be granted for the Board to have jurisdiction over a VEOA claim. <span class="Italic">Haasz,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 492, &#x00B6; 6 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The jurisdictional requirements differ somewhat where an appellant alleges a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), which provides that certain categories of veterans may not be denied the right to compete for vacant positions for which the agency accepts applications from individuals outside its work force under merit promotion procedures. In such a case, the appellant must exhaust his remedy with DOL and non-frivolously allege that he is a veteran covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), that he was denied the right to compete under merit promotion procedures for a vacant position for which the agency accepted applications from individuals outside its workforce, and that the denial occurred on or after December 10, 2004. <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 31 (2007). The appellant alleges for the first time on review that the agency considered an individual from outside its work force in filling a custodian position. To the extent that the appellant is alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), he has not shown that his argument is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite his due diligence, and we have not considered it. <span class="Italic">See Banks v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980). In any event, the evidence relied upon by the appellant in support of this argument suggests that the agency "transferred" the individual from a postal facility in Cadott, Wisconsin, and thus it did not accept applications from outside the Postal Service workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has exhausted his remedy with DOL. The record further reflects that he is a preference eligible and that the events at issue took place after October 30, 1998. In addition, the Board has held that an appellant's allegation, in general terms, that his veterans' preference rights were violated is sufficient to meet the non-frivolous allegation requirement. <span class="Italic">Haasz,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 364, &#x00B6; 8 (2006). The appellant has made such a general allegation. We therefore find, contrary to the initial decision, that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's VEOA claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be entitled to relief under VEOA, an appellant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency violated one or more of his statutory or regulatory veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 199 Fed. Appx. 948 (Fed. Cir. 2006). It is undisputed that all of the custodial positions in question were filled through internal reassignment, rather than through a competitive examination process. Veterans' preference does not apply to such intra-agency transfers. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 247 F.3d 1222, 1224 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Glenn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 939 F.2d 1516, 1520-22 (11th Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">but cf. Perkins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 20 (in an open competitive examination process, internal preference eligible applicants are to be awarded the same veterans' preference afforded to external preference eligible applicants). The appellant's claim that the agency prematurely deemed his application to have expired is not cognizable under VEOA, as the alleged error does not implicate a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Haasz,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 349, &#x00B6; 10. The same is true of the appellant's allegation that the agency failed to give him preference based on his union membership. We therefore find that the appellant is not entitled to remedial action under VEOA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to Postal Service employees, VEOA requires the agency to consider external applicants with veterans preference status if the agency solicits external candidates, even though the position being filled is in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Boctor v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 580, 581-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12, 2009 MSPB 30 (2009) (<span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Boctor v. VA</span>, 342 Fed. Appx. 625 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP)) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-380.html#sec1-372">Merit Promotion, Open to External Candidates; Canceled Announcement; 'Right to Compete' Claim</a>"], determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case issued two separate vacancy announcements for the position of sales specialist. One of the announcements indicated that applications would be accepted only from "E.A.S. career Postal employees...." The other, an "External Recruitment Announcement," included no such restriction. It indicated, however, that agency employees were to "only apply through the internal merit promotion process."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who was not an employee of the agency, submitted an application under the external announcement. The agency did not consider the appellant or any other individual who applied under the external announcement, however. Instead, after considering the internal candidates, and after selecting one of those candidates, it apparently canceled the external announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_607"></span>We have indicated above that the administrative judge found that the agency violated the appellant's right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to compete for the sales specialist position. The title of section 3304, "Competitive service; examinations," appears to indicate that the section applies only to competitive service positions, and not to excepted service positions such as the position at issue here. <span class="Italic">See As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 76, &#x00B6; 16 (2000) (positions in the Postal Service are excepted service positions). Under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(2), however, the "provisions of title 5 [of the U.S. Code] relating to a preference eligible (as that term is defined under section 2108(3) of such title) shall apply to an applicant for appointment and any officer or employee of the Postal Service in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the applicant, officer, or employee were subject to the competitive service under such title." As we have noted below, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) expressly provides preference eligibles with a right to compete for vacant positions under certain circumstances. Clearly, therefore, it is a provision "relating to a preference eligible...." <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 16 (2006) (section 3304(f)(1) is "a statute 'relating to veterans' preference' for which VEOA provides a remedy in the event of a violation thereof").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, as a preference eligible veteran, the appellant in this case is covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), "[p]reference eligibles...may not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce...." In concluding that the agency had violated this provision, the administrative judge found that the agency had accepted applications for the sales specialist position from outside its workforce, and that it had failed to consider the appellant for the position. She also indicated, quoting regulations on which the Board relied in <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12 (2006), that individuals covered under the provision were entitled to "compete for vacancies under merit promotion when an agency accept[ed] applications from individuals outside its own workforce." Initial Decision at 8-9 (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.106).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that <span class="Italic">Brandt</span> implicitly makes a "distinction between when external applications are <span class="Italic">solicited</span> and when external applicants are <span class="Italic">considered</span>." According to the agency, "once any external applicants are considered, veterans' preference concepts <span class="Italic">may</span> be applicable." Because it did not consider any of the external applicants, the agency argues, it was permitted to hire an internal candidate without considering the appellant or any other external applicants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see nothing in <span class="Italic">Brandt</span> that supports the agency's argument. While the Board did not expressly hold in that case that an agency had an obligation under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) to consider preference eligibles and veterans even when it did not consider the outside candidates whose applications it had accepted, its failure to do so cannot properly be interpreted as an implicit holding that the agency would have no such obligation. Instead, the Board simply had no reason there to address that obligation, since the agency in that case had in fact considered the outside applicants. <span class="Italic">See Brandt,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 2. Moreover, the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1) shows that a preference eligible's right to compete for an announced vacancy arises whenever "the agency making the announcement <span class="Italic">will accept applications</span> from individuals outside its own workforce" (emphasis added), and not just when it considers those applications it indicated a willingness to accept. In addition, we see no merit in the agency's argument that it was not required to consider the appellant because its own procedures required it to consider qualified internal candidates before considering external candidates. Such procedures cannot override the agency's statutory obligations. <span class="Italic">See Garza v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 336, &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (a regulation cannot override a clearly stated statutory requirement), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 F.3d 763 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency violated the appellant's rights as a preference eligible veteran when it failed to consider him for the sales specialist position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, as we have noted above, the agency asserts that the administrative judge erred in concluding that, because it had indicated that it would accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce, it was "obliged to consider all external applicants under 'competitive examination principles....'" We see nothing in the administrative judge's analysis of the merits of this appeal that suggests that her finding that the agency violated the appellant's rights was based on the agency's failure to consider any external candidates other than the appellant. Instead, the administrative judge indicated that the basis for her finding of a violation was the agency's failure to consider the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> Initial Decision at 9, 15; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 12 (finding that the agency did not violate the appellant's rights by canceling the external vacancy announcement). We also see nothing in her analysis that suggests that she based her finding on the agency's failure to use "competitive examination principles" in making its selection. She indicated instead that the agency's use of merit promotion procedures was proper.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the administrative judge ordered the agency to reconstruct the hiring process for the sales specialist position under both the internal and the external vacancy announcements. The language used in describing the action to be taken could be regarded as requiring the agency to consider not only the appellant but every other qualified candidate who applied under either announcement. We see no need for the agency to consider all candidates who applied under the external announcement. Only those applicants who are preference eligibles and "veterans," as that term is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1), must be considered.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;If the agency determines, through the reconstructed hiring process, that it would have selected another covered veteran or preference eligible instead of the appellant, then the appellant will not have shown that he would have been hired in the absence of the violation found above. The agency will not, under those circumstances, be required to place the appellant in the sales specialist position at issue here.</p>
