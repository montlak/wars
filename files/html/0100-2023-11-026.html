<p class="noindent">On May 25, 2018, President Trump issued now-revoked Executive Order 13,837 seeking to control and limit the use of official time and agency resources available for unions. "Ensuring Transparency, Accountability, and Efficiency in Taxpayer Funded Union Time Use," 83 Fed. Reg. 25,335, 25,336 (May 25, 2018), at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11916/ensuring-transparency-accountability-and-efficiency-in-taxpayer-funded-union-time-use">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11916/ensuring-transparency-accountability-and-efficiency-in-taxpayer-funded-union-time-use</a>, served as a directive to agencies and, as applied in <span class="Italic">POPA and USPTO</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-232.html">71 FLRA 1223</a>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, it provided guidance to FLRA in resolution of negotiability appeals and ULP complaints concerning official time.

Reg. 25,343, 25,344 (May 25, 2018). Executive Orders 13,837, 13,839, and 13,836 were revoked by President Biden's Executive Order 14,003, of January 22, 2021. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-27/pdf/2021-01924.pdf">https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-01-27/pdf/2021-01924.pdf</a></p>
<p class="noindent">Exec. Order 13,837 provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and section 7301 of title 5, United States Code, and to ensure the effective functioning of the executive branch, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1. Purpose. An effective and efficient government keeps careful track of how it spends the taxpayers' money and eliminates unnecessary, inefficient, or unreasonable expenditures. To advance this policy, executive branch employees should spend their duty hours performing the work of the Federal Government and serving the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Federal law allows Federal employees to represent labor organizations and perform other non-agency business while being paid by American taxpayers (taxpayer-funded union time). The Congress, however, has also instructed the executive branch to interpret the law in a manner consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To that end, agencies should ensure that taxpayer-funded union time is used efficiently and authorized in amounts that are reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Federal employees should spend the clear majority of their duty hours working for the public. No agency should pay for Federal labor organizations' expenses, except where required by law. Agencies should eliminate unrestricted grants of taxpayer-funded union time and instead require employees to obtain specific authorization before using such time. Agencies should also monitor use of taxpayer-funded union time, ensure it is used only for authorized purposes, and make information regarding its use readily available to the public.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 2. Definitions. For purposes of this order, the following definitions shall apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Except for purposes of section 4 of this order, "agency" has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(3) of title 5, United States Code, but includes only executive agencies. For purposes of section 4 of this order, "agency" has the meaning given to "Executive agency" in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excludes the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;"Agency business" shall mean work performed by Federal employees, including detailees or assignees, on behalf of an agency, but does not include work performed on taxpayer-funded union time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;"Bargaining unit" shall mean a group of employees represented by an exclusive representative in an appropriate unit for collective bargaining under subchapter II of chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;"Discounted use of government property" means charging less to use government property than the value of the use of such property, as determined by the General Services Administration, where applicable, or otherwise by the generally prevailing commercial cost of using such property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;"Employee" has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code, except for purposes of section 4 of this order, in which case it means an individual employed in an "Executive agency," according to the meaning given that term in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, but excluding the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;"Grievance" has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(9) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;"Labor organization" has the meaning given the term in section 7103(a)(4) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(h)&#x2003;"Paid time" shall mean time for which an employee is paid by the Federal Government, including both duty time, in which the employee performs agency business, and taxpayer-funded union time. It does not include time spent on paid or unpaid leave, or an employee's off-duty hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(i)&#x2003;"Taxpayer-funded union time" shall mean official time granted to an employee pursuant to section 7131 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(j)&#x2003;"Union time rate" shall mean the total number of duty hours in the fiscal year that employees in a bargaining unit used for taxpayer-funded union time, divided by the number of employees in such bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 3. Standards for Reasonable and Efficient Taxpayer&#8209;Funded Union Time Usage.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;No agency shall agree to authorize any amount of taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, unless such time is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest. Agreements authorizing taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour should, taking into account the size of the bargaining unit, and the amount of taxpayer-funded union time anticipated to be granted under sections 7131(a) and 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code, ordinarily not be considered reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, or to satisfy the "effective and efficient" goal set forth in section 1 of this order and section 7101(b) of title 5, United States Code. Agencies shall commit the time and resources necessary to strive for a negotiated union time rate of 1 hour or less, and to fulfill their obligation to bargain in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)(i) If an agency agrees to authorize amounts of taxpayer-funded union time under section 7131(d) of title 5, United States Code, that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour (or proposes to the Federal Service Impasses Panel or an arbitrator engaging in interest arbitration an amount that would cause the union time rate in a bargaining unit to exceed 1 hour), the agency head shall report this agreement or proposal to the President through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM Director) within 15 days of such an agreement or proposal. Such report shall explain why such expenditures are reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest, describe the benefit (if any) the public will receive from the activities conducted by employees on such taxpayer-funded union time, and identify the total cost of such time to the agency. This reporting duty cannot be delegated.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;Each agency head shall require relevant subordinate agency officials to inform the agency head 5 business days in advance of presenting or accepting a proposal that would result in a union time rate of greater than 1 hour for any bargaining unit, if the subordinate agency officials anticipate they will present or agree to such a provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply to a union time rate established pursuant to an order of the Federal Service Impasses Panel or an arbitrator engaging in interest arbitration, provided that the agency had proposed that the Impasses Panel or arbitrator establish a union time rate of 1 hour or less.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any agency from authorizing taxpayer-funded union time as required under sections 7131(a) and 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code, or to direct an agency to negotiate to include in a collective bargaining agreement a term that precludes an agency from granting taxpayer-funded union time pursuant to those provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 4. Employee Conduct with Regard to Agency Time and Resources. (a) To ensure that Federal resources are used effectively and efficiently and in a manner consistent with both the public interest and section 8 of this order, all employees shall adhere to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;Employees may not engage in lobbying activities during paid time, except in their official capacities as an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this subsection, employees shall spend at least three-quarters of their paid time, <span id="Page_261"></span>measured each fiscal year, performing agency business or attending necessary training (as required by their agency), in order to ensure that they develop and maintain the skills necessary to perform their agency duties efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;Employees who have spent one-quarter of their paid time in any fiscal year on non-agency business may continue to use taxpayer-funded union time in that fiscal year for purposes covered by sections 7131(a) or 7131(c) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;Any time in excess of one-quarter of an employee's paid time used to perform non-agency business in a fiscal year shall count toward the limitation set forth in subparagraph (1) of this subsection in subsequent fiscal years.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii) No employee, when acting on behalf of a Federal labor organization, may be permitted the free or discounted use of government property or any other agency resources if such free or discounted use is not generally available for non-agency business by employees when acting on behalf of non-Federal organizations. Such property and resources include office or meeting space, reserved parking spaces, phones, computers, and computer systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;Employees may not be permitted reimbursement for expenses incurred performing non-agency business, unless required by law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(v)(1)Employees may not use taxpayer-funded union time to prepare or pursue grievances (including arbitration of grievances) brought against an agency under procedures negotiated pursuant to section 7121 of title 5, United States Code, except where such use is otherwise authorized by law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;The prohibition in subparagraph (1) of this subsection does not apply to:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(A)&#x2003;an employee using taxpayer-funded union time to prepare for, confer with an exclusive representative regarding, or present a grievance brought on the employee's own behalf; or to appear as a witness in any grievance proceeding; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(B)&#x2003;an employee using taxpayer-funded union time to challenge an adverse personnel action taken against the employee in retaliation for engaging in federally protected whistleblower activity, including for engaging in activity protected under section 2302(b)(8) of title 5, United States Code, under section 78u-6(h)(1) of title 15, United States Code, under section 3730(h) of title 31, United States Code, or under any other similar whistleblower law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Employees may not use taxpayer-funded union time without advance written authorization from their agency, except where obtaining prior approval is deemed impracticable under regulations or guidance adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)(i) The requirements of this section shall become effective 45 days from the date of this order. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall be responsible for administering the requirements of this section. Within 45 days of the date of this order, the OPM Director shall examine whether existing regulations are consistent with the rules set forth in this section. If the regulations are not, the OPM Director shall propose for notice and public comment, as soon as practicable, appropriate regulations to clarify and assist agencies in implementing these rules, consistent with applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;The head of each agency is responsible for ensuring compliance by employees within such agency with the requirements of this section, to the extent consistent with applicable law and existing collective bargaining agreements. Each agency head shall examine whether existing regulations, policies, and practices are consistent with the rules set forth in this section. If they are not, the agency head shall take all appropriate steps consistent with applicable law to bring them into compliance with this section as soon as practicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall be construed to prohibit agencies from permitting employees to take unpaid leave to perform representational activities under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, including for purposes covered by section 7121(b)(1)(C) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 5. Preventing Unlawful or Unauthorized Expenditures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Any employee who uses taxpayer-funded union time without advance written agency authorization required by section 4(b) of this order, or for purposes not specifically authorized by the agency, shall be considered absent without leave and subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Repeated misuse of taxpayer-funded union time may constitute serious misconduct that impairs the efficiency of the Federal service. In such instances, agencies shall take appropriate disciplinary action to address such misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;As soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days from the date of this order, to the extent permitted by law, each agency shall develop and implement a procedure governing the authorization of taxpayer-funded union time under section 4(b) of this order. Such procedure shall, at a minimum, require a requesting employee to specify the number of taxpayer-funded union time hours to be used and the specific purposes for which such time will be used, providing sufficient detail to identify the tasks the employee will undertake. That procedure shall also allow the authorizing official to assess whether it is reasonable and necessary to grant such amount of time to accomplish such tasks. For continuing or ongoing requests, each agency shall require requests for authorization renewals to be submitted not less than once per pay period. Each agency shall further require separate advance authorization for any use of taxpayer-funded union time in excess of previously authorized hours or for purposes for which such time was not previously authorized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;As soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days from the date of this order, each agency shall develop and implement a system to monitor the use of taxpayer-funded union time to ensure that it is used only for authorized purposes, and that it is not used contrary to law or regulation. In developing these systems, each agency shall give special attention to ensuring taxpayer-funded union time is not used for:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;&#x2003;internal union business in violation of section 7131(b) of title 5, United States Code;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;&#x2003;lobbying activities in violation of section 1913 of title 18, United States Code, or in violation of section 4(a)(i) of this order; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003;&#x2003;political activities in violation of subchapter III of chapter 73 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 6. Agency Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;To the extent permitted by law, each agency shall submit an annual report to OPM on the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;The purposes for which the agency has authorized the use of taxpayer-funded union time, and the amounts of time used for each such purpose;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;The job title and total compensation of each employee who has used taxpayer-funded union time in the fiscal year, as well as the total number of hours each employee spent on these activities and the proportion of each employee's total paid hours that number represents;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iii)&#x2003; If the agency has allowed labor organizations or individuals on taxpayer-funded union time the free or discounted use of government property, the total value of such free or discounted use;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;Any expenses the agency paid for activities conducted on taxpayer-funded union time; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(v)&#x2003;The amount of any reimbursement paid by the labor organizations for the use of government property.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Agencies shall notify the OPM Labor Relations Group established pursuant to the Executive Order entitled "Developing Efficient, Effective, and Cost-Reducing Approaches to Federal Sector Collective Bargaining" of May 25, 2018, if a bargaining unit's union time rate exceeds 1 hour.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;If an agency's aggregate union time rate (i.e., the average of the union time rates in each agency bargaining unit, weighted by the number of employees in each unit) has increased overall from the last fiscal year, the agency shall explain this increase in the report required under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;The OPM Director shall set a date by which agency submissions under this section are due.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 7. Public Disclosure and Transparency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Within 180 days of the date of this order, the OPM Director shall publish a standardized form that each agency shall use in preparing the reports required by section 6 of this order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;OPM shall analyze the agency submissions under section 6 of this order and produce an annual report detailing:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;for each agency and for agencies in the aggregate, the number of employees using taxpayer-funded union time, the number of employees using taxpayer-funded union time separately listed by intervals of the proportion of paid time spent on such activities, the number of hours spent on taxpayer-funded union time, the cost of taxpayer-funded union time (measured by the compensation of the employees involved), the aggregate union time rate, the number of bargaining unit employees, and the percentage change in each of these values from the previous fiscal year;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;for each agency and in the aggregate, the value of the free or discounted use of any government property the agency has provided to labor organizations, and any expenses, such as travel or per diems, the agency paid for activities conducted on taxpayer-funded union time, as well as the amount of any reimbursement paid for such use of government property, and the percentage change in each of these values from the previous fiscal year;</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_262"></span>(iii) &#x2003;the purposes for which taxpayer-funded union time was granted; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(iv)&#x2003;the information required by section 6(a)(ii) of this order for employees using taxpayer-funded union time, sufficiently aggregated that such disclosure would not unduly risk disclosing information protected by law, including personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The OPM Director shall publish the annual report required by this section by June 30 of each year. The first report shall cover fiscal year 2019 and shall be published by June 30, 2020.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;The OPM Director shall, after consulting with the Chief Human Capital Officers designated under chapter 14 of title 5, United States Code, promulgate any additional guidance that may be necessary or appropriate to assist the heads of agencies in complying with the requirements of this order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 8. Implementation and Renegotiation of Collective Bargaining Agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Each agency shall implement the requirements of this order within 45 days of the date of this order, except for subsection 4(b) of this order, which shall be effective for employees at an agency when such agency implements the procedure required by section 5(b) of this order, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their obligations under collective bargaining agreements in force on the date of this order. The head of each agency shall designate an official within the agency tasked with ensuring implementation of this order, and shall report the identity of such official to OPM within 30 days of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Each agency shall consult with employee labor representatives about the implementation of this order. On the earliest date permitted by law, and to effectuate the terms of this order, any agency that is party to a collective bargaining agreement that has at least one provision that is inconsistent with any part of this order shall give any contractually required notice of its intent to alter the terms of such agreement and either reopen negotiations and negotiate to obtain provisions consistent with this order, or subsequently terminate such provision and implement the requirements of this order, as applicable under law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sec. 9. General Provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreement in effect on the date of this order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall be construed to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under chapter 71 of title 5, United States Code, or encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;If any provision of this order, including any of its applications, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and all of its other applications shall not be affected thereby.</p>
<p class="noindent">Litigation to enjoin the 2018 executive order resulted in a decision of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Trump</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d 370 (D.D.C. 2018) [<a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv1261-58">https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2018cv1261-58</a>], enjoining portions of the executive order. The operative section of the court's order was that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FURTHER ORDERED that sections 5(a), 5(e), and 6 of Executive Order 13,836 (also known as "The Collective Bargaining Procedures Order"); sections 3(a), 4(a), and 4(b) of Executive Order 13,837 (also known as "The Official Time Order"); and sections 3, 4(a), and 4(c) of Executive Order 13,839 (also known as "The Removal Procedures Order") are hereby declared INVALID. All other provisions of these Executive Orders REMAIN IN EFFECT.</p>
<p class="noindent">The supporting memorandum opinion of District Judge Jackson provides a lengthy review of the history of federal sector labor relations. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. That court vacated the district court's decision. The appellate court determined that sufficient means existed to challenge collective bargaining approaches by agencies under the Executive Order; no basis existed for the court to enjoin that order as a negation of statutory bargaining rights, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Trump</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20190716129">929 F.3d 748</a>, <span class="blue">752-61</span> (D.C. Cir. 2019) (rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span> denied Sept. 25, 2019):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May 2018, the President issued three executive orders regarding federal labor-management relations. Among other requirements, the "Collective Bargaining Order" provides agencies with certain procedures that they should seek to institute during negotiations with unions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,836, <span class="Italic">Developing Efficient, Effective, and Cost-Reducing Approaches to Federal Sector Collective Bargaining</span>, 83 Fed. Reg. 25,329, 25,331-32 (May 25, 2018). This order also tells agencies not to negotiate over "permissive" subjects, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 25,332, defined as those that are negotiable "at the election of the agency" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "Official Time Order" instructs agencies to aim to limit the extent to which collective bargaining agreements authorize "official time," meaning time spent by employees on union business during working hours. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 13,837, <span class="Italic">Ensuring Transparency, Accountability, and Efficiency in Taxpayer-Funded Union Time Use</span>, 83 Fed. Reg. 25,335, 25,336 (May 25, 2018). This order also establishes rules that limit whether "agency time and resources" may be used by employees on non-government business. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 25,337 (capitalization omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "Removal Procedures Order" tells agencies to seek to exclude from grievance proceedings any dispute over a decision to remove an employee "for misconduct or unacceptable performance." Exec. Order No. 13,839, <span class="Italic">Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent With Merit System Principles</span>, 83 Fed. Reg. 25,343, 25,344 (May 25, 2018). Subject to various exceptions, this order also prohibits agencies from resolving disputes over employee ratings and incentive pay through grievance or arbitration proceedings, and it mandates that some subpar employees may have no more than thirty days to improve their performance before being reassigned, demoted, or fired. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 25,344-45.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although numerous, the various challenged provisions of the executive orders fall into three categories: provisions that (1) direct agencies to refuse to bargain over "permissive" subjects based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1); (2) establish government-wide rules for employee and agency conduct, which may have the effect of removing mandatory subjects from bargaining based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1); and (3) set goals that agencies must pursue during bargaining. The executive orders enforce these goals by directing agencies to "commit the time and resources necessary" to achieve them and by requiring agencies to notify the President through the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) if the goals are not met. 83 Fed. Reg. at 25,331-32, 25,336, 25,344. The orders also require agencies "to fulfill their obligation to bargain in good faith" throughout their dealings with unions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 25,331, 25,336; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 25,344.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court issued its decision in late August 2018.&#x2003;The court first held that it had subject matter jurisdiction, rejecting the government's argument that jurisdiction belonged exclusively to the FLRA and (on direct review from the FLRA) the courts of appeals. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 395-409. On the merits, the district court ruled that the President has constitutional and statutory authority to issue executive orders in the field of federal labor relations generally, but nine provisions of these executive orders violated the Statute: Some did so by removing from the bargaining table subjects that "must" or "may" be negotiable, others by preventing agencies from bargaining in good faith. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 412-33. The court enjoined the President's subordinates within the executive branch from implementing these provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 440; Order at 2-3, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Trump</span>, No. 1:18-cv-1261 (D.D.C. Aug. 24, 2018), Dkt. No. 57.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within constitutional bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction to consider." <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Russell</span>, 551 U.S. 205, 212 (2007). District courts have jurisdiction over civil actions arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331, but Congress may preclude district court jurisdiction by establishing an alternative statutory scheme for administrative and judicial review. To determine whether Congress has done so, we use the two-step framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich</span>, 510 U.S. 200 (1994). Under that framework, "Congress intended that a litigant proceed exclusively through a statutory scheme...when (i) such intent is 'fairly discernible in the statutory scheme,' and (ii) the litigant's claims are 'of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within [the] statutory structure.'" <span class="Italic">Jarkesy v. SEC</span>, 803 F.3d 9, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, 510 U.S. at 207, 212); <span class="Italic">see Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd</span>., 561 U.S. 477, 489 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the district court concluded that the first step is satisfied. <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d at 396-97. The parties do not dispute this conclusion on appeal, nor could they. "With the FSLMRS, as with all of the CSRA: 'Congress passed an enormously complicated and subtle scheme to govern employee relations in the federal sector.'" <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Sec'y of the Air Force</span>, 716 F.3d 633, 636 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quoting <span class="Italic">Steadman v. Governor, U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990)). The scheme "provides the exclusive procedures by which federal employees and their bargaining representatives may assert federal labor-management relations claims." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 638; <span class="Italic">see AFGE v. Loy</span>, 367 F.3d 932, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Thus, we can fairly discern that Congress intended the statutory scheme to be exclusive with respect to claims within its scope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_263"></span>The parties' dispute arises at the second step. There, the district court held that the unions' claims are not "of the type" Congress intended for review within the statutory scheme. <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d at 397-409. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Claims "will be found to fall outside of the scope of a special statutory scheme in only limited circumstances, when (1) a finding of preclusion might foreclose all meaningful judicial review; (2) the claim[s] [are] wholly collateral to the statutory review provisions; and (3) the claims are beyond the expertise of the agency." <span class="Italic">Arch Coal, Inc. v. Acosta</span>, 888 F.3d 493, 500 (D.C. Cir. 2018); <span class="Italic">see Free Enter. Fund</span>, 561 U.S. at 489; <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin</span>, 510 U.S. at 212-13. These considerations do not form "three distinct inputs into a strict mathematical formula." <span class="Italic">Jarkesy</span>, 803 F.3d at 17. Rather, they serve as "general guideposts useful for channeling the inquiry into whether the particular claims at issue fall outside an overarching congressional design." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, all three considerations demonstrate that the unions must pursue their claims through the statutory scheme and not before the district court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the present record, it appears that the Statute provides the unions with several "administrative options" for challenging the executive orders before the FLRA, followed by judicial review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 637. First, if an agency follows the executive orders' goal-setting provisions while bargaining with a union, the union could charge in an unfair labor practice proceeding that the agency's adherence to those provisions amounted to bad-faith bargaining in violation of the Statute. The FLRA could then determine whether the agency had done so, and whether the agency may continue pursuing those goals during bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, if an agency refuses to bargain over various subjects based on the executive orders' government-wide rules, the unions could charge in a negotiability or unfair labor practice dispute that the agency had refused to bargain over mandatory matters in violation of the Statute. In response, the government could argue (as it does here) that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) authorizes it to remove subjects from bargaining in this way, and the FLRA could then determine whether the government is correct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. Local 15</span>, 33 F.L.R.A. 436, 438-39 (1988); <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 Union</span>, 31 F.L.R.A. 322, 345-47 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf. IRS v. FLRA</span>, 996 F.2d 1246, 1252 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (reviewing the FLRA's holding as to whether a government-wide rule displaced the duty to bargain under the Statute, indicating that the FLRA may hear such claims).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same sequence could occur if an agency refuses to bargain over permissive subjects as directed by the executive orders.&#x2003;The union could charge the agency with violating the Statute, and the government could respond (as it does here) by invoking 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), which states that certain subjects are negotiable "at the election of the agency." The FLRA could then determine whether the agency may refuse to bargain in this way. These administrative options might enable the unions to obtain from the FLRA much of the review and relief that they sought from the district court. The unions worry that the FLRA cannot address all of their claims, especially their broader claims: that the President acted ultra vires or violated the Take Care Clause, the First Amendment, or the Statute in issuing the executive orders. And the unions argue that the FLRA cannot entertain suits against the President. Even if true, the latter point does not appear to make FLRA review any less meaningful than district court review in this case, where the unions stated that injunctive relief against the President's subordinates in executive branch agencies was sufficient to afford them the relief they sought and the district court did not grant injunctive relief against the President. Instead, the unions obtained an order directing that the President's subordinates may not implement various provisions of the executive orders during bargaining. On this record, it appears that the unions may seek similar orders through the statutory scheme. Indeed, the government has even taken the position that the FLRA would have the authority to resolve the unions' broad statutory claims, specifically those asserting that the executive orders are invalid or ultra vires under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Requiring the unions here to proceed through the FSLMRS's scheme does not foreclose "all meaningful judicial review." <span class="Italic">See Arch Coal</span>, 888 F.3d at 500. Although the unions are not able to pursue their preferred systemwide challenge through the scheme, they can ultimately obtain review of and relief from the executive orders by litigating their claims in the context of concrete bargaining disputes. Such review, according to <span class="Italic">Thunder Basin, Air Force</span>, and <span class="Italic">Loy</span>, qualifies as meaningful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unions' challenge in this case is of the type that is regularly adjudicated through the FSLMRS's scheme: disputes over whether the Statute has been violated. And the unions ask the district court for the same relief that they could ultimately obtain through the statutory scheme, namely rulings on whether the executive orders are lawful and directives prohibiting agencies from following the executive orders during bargaining disputes. Their challenge is not wholly collateral to the statutory scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the unions' claims are not "beyond the expertise" of the FLRA. <span class="Italic">See Arch Coal</span>, 888 F.3d at 500. Many of their claims allege that the executive orders direct agencies to violate the Statute by refusing to bargain over mandatory subjects or by taking actions that are inconsistent with the duty to bargain in good faith. These matters lie at the core of the FLRA's "specialized expertise in the field of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Locals No. 214 v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d 1525, 1528 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The FLRA has "primary responsibility for administering and interpreting" the Statute, <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a), and it serves the "'special function of applying the general provisions of the [Statute] to the complexities' of federal labor relations," <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Emps. Local 1309 v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 99 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">ATF</span>, 464 U.S. at 97). In doing so, the FLRA "regularly construes" the Statute and adjudicates whether governmental actions violate the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Elgin</span>, 567 U.S. at 23. Indeed, unlike Article III courts, the FLRA's "ordinary course of business" involves determining whether subjects are mandatory bargaining topics or whether the government has bargained in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Jarkesy</span>, 803 F.3d at 28. The FLRA's familiarity with federal labor-management relations is thus more than "helpful background knowledge." <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d at 408. It is expertise that goes to the core issues in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court also viewed the unions' claims as "primarily" concerned with "separation-of-powers issues" and "whether a statute or the Constitution has authorized the President to act in a particular way"--issues that are the "bread and butter of the Judicial Branch." <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d at 408 (citing <span class="Italic">Youngstown Sheet &#x0026; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>, 343 U.S. 579, 597 (1952) (Frankfurter, J., concurring), and <span class="Italic">Marbury v. Madison</span>, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177 (1803)). As already discussed, many of the claims are not so grand, but rather require interpreting the FSLMRS--the very law that the FLRA is charged with administering and interpreting. Regardless, the Supreme Court has "clarified" that "an agency's relative level of insight into the <span class="Italic">merits</span> of a constitutional question is not determinative." <span class="Italic">Jarkesy</span>, 803 F.3d at 28-29 (citing <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 567 U.S. at 22-23). Even in the absence of constitutional expertise, an agency's expertise in other areas may still weigh in favor of administrative review if the agency could "obviate the need to address" broad constitutional and statutory claims by resolving a case on other grounds or if the agency could "alleviate constitutional concerns" through its interpretation of its statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 29 (quoting <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 567 U.S. at 22-23); <span class="Italic">see Bank of La</span>., 919 F.3d at 929-30. That is the case here. The FLRA could "moot the need to resolve" the unions' constitutional claims by concluding that the Statute bars agencies from implementing the executive orders. <span class="Italic">See Jarkesy</span>, 803 F.3d at 29; <span class="Italic">cf. AFGE</span>, 318 F. Supp.3d at 430 n.16 (doing just that by declining to resolve the First Amendment claim after concluding that the provision at issue ran afoul of the Statute). Also, the FLRA "could offer an interpretation of the [Statute] in the course of the proceeding" that might alleviate or "shed light on" the constitutional concerns. <span class="Italic">See Jarkesy</span>, 803 F.3d at 29. After all, "there are precious few cases involving interpretation of statutes authorizing agency action in which our review is not aided by the agency's statutory construction." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Christopher</span>, 996 F.2d 375, 379 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). Because the FLRA's expertise can be "brought to bear" on the unions' claims in these ways, "we see no reason to conclude that Congress intended to exempt" the claims from the statutory scheme. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">The provisions of the EOs relied upon by the Agency here do not conflict with the Statute.&#x2003;The Union argues that the EOs conflict with the duty to bargain in good faith provided by &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute. While the EOs do dictate how executive branch agencies should bargain, they do not explicitly conflict with any provision of the Statute.[26] As relevant here, EO 13836 provides that "agencies should secure [collective-bargaining agreements] that:...do not cover matters that are not, by law, subject to bargaining," and that agencies "may not negotiate over the substance of the subjects set forth in [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(1)."[27] This is consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute which provides "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--<span class="Italic">at the election of the agency</span>, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work."[28]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[28] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) (emphasis added). The dissent claims that our reliance on the plain language of the Statute is not a rationale. Dissent at 17. We disagree. <span class="Italic">See Bostock v. Clayton Cty., Ga</span>., 140 S. Ct 1731, 1737 (2020) (stating that "when the <span class="Italic">express</span> terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest[; o]nly the written word is the law") (emphasis added). We also note that courts typically read executive orders and statutes harmoniously where it is reasonably possible to do so. <span class="Italic">See Rattigan v. Holder</span>, 689 F.3d 764, 770 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (imputing "knowingly false" standard to Title VII "reporting and referral" claims so as to harmonize with Executive Order); <span class="Italic">Harris v. United States</span>, 19 F.3d 1090, 1095 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding that Executive Order was not implicitly overruled by later statutes and explaining that because the Executive Order and the statutes can "operate concurrently" both should stand).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EO 13837 requires agencies to ensure that "taxpayer-funded union time is used efficiently and authorized in amounts that are <span class="Italic">reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest</span>." EO 13837 also requires that employees only spend one-quarter of their paid time performing non-agency business, which includes taxpayer-funded union time, with any additional time spent counting towards the one-quarter cap for the next fiscal year. The President's direction that federal "employees shall spend at least three-quarters of their paid time...performing agency business" or attending agency-required training falls clearly within his statutory discretion to "prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301. This is also consistent with &#x00A7; 7131 of the Statute, which provides that official time shall be granted "in any amount <span class="Italic">the agency and the exclusive representative</span> involved <span class="Italic">agree</span> to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest."[33]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[33] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7131(d) (emphasis added). Again, the dissent accuses us of disregarding the purpose of the Statute in reaching this conclusion. Dissent at 17. We again, fail to see how a conclusion based on the plain language of the Statute can contradict the purpose of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Hall v. United States</span>, 566 U.S. 506, 519 (2012) (relying on the plain language, context, and structure of a statute to determine the meaning of the terms in question); <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson</span>, 456 U.S. 63, 68 (1982) (finding that "the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used [by Congress]") (citing <span class="Italic">Richards v. U.S</span>., 369 U.S. 1, 9 (1962)). The dissent's contrary view relies on an overly broad reading of this part of the Statute--that the Statute means to give the agency head or his or her designee complete freedom to decide what is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest," unfettered by any direction from his or her superior (the President) or any government-wide rule as to what is "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7131(d). But the President's authority under Article II of the Constitution includes the power to "control[&#8197;] those who execute the laws," <span class="Italic">Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Bd</span>., 561 U.S. 477, 492 (2010) (quoting James Madison, 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789)), and his power under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301 includes the right to set rules for how federal employees conduct the public's business--whether at the bargaining table or elsewhere. The Statute did not cut the heart out of these constitutional and statutory provisions by creating a zone of collective bargaining where agency representatives may operate free from lawful constraints from their superiors, the dissent's argument notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, EO 13837 provides that "employees may not be permitted reimbursement for expenses incurred performing non-agency business, unless required by law or regulation," and "employees may not use taxpayer-funded union time[34] to prepare or pursue grievances brought against the agency...except where such use is otherwise authorized by law or regulation."[35] The Statute does not contain any language that contradicts either of these provisions.[36] As such, the EOs are consistent with the Statute. Therefore, they are accorded the force and effect of law and affect the negotiability of proposals.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[34] EO 13837 defines "taxpayer-funded union time" as "official time granted to an employee pursuant to [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131]." EO 13837, 83 Fed. Reg. at 25,336.</p>

Contrary to the Union's argument, EO 13837's official time provisions prescribe a uniform rule for employee conduct, applicable across the entire government, and thus counts as a "government-wide rule." And if the Executive's right to issue government-wide rules were limited to subjects unregulated by the Statute, then &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1)'s express exception from the scope of bargaining for "government-wide rule[s] or regulation[s]" would have no effect at all. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1).</p>

Section 3(f) provides that "[t]he heads of agencies shall, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding, the actions identified in the review" described in Section 3(e), "as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the policy set forth in section 1" of the EO. This includes, but is not limited to, the following actions: </p>

<p class="noindent-2">Affected agencies shall, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the policy articulated in EO 14003, and as soon as practicable, suspend, revise or rescind the actions covered in any agency policies, if applicable, implementing requirements pursuant to sections 4(b) and 5(b) of EO 13837.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Affected agencies shall, as soon as practicable, suspend, revise, or rescind existing agency actions taken to implement sections 4(b) and 5(b) of EO 13837 and, as necessary, establish procedures regarding approval of official time, subject to any collective bargaining obligations under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">To the extent affected agencies successfully renegotiated any CBA provisions intended to implement requirements of sections 4(b) and 5(b) of EO 13837 (e.g. official time approval procedures, etc.), agencies must identify those provisions and, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law and the policy articulated in EO 14003, engage impacted unions, as soon as practicable, to suspend, revise or rescind the actions covered in these CBA provisions.[3] In carrying out this task, agencies should take a hard look at the degree to which, if any, EO 13837 influenced bargaining-table strategy and decision making. EO 14003 neither requires nor prohibits affected agencies from reopening CBAs on other matters not related to subjects covered by EO 13837. </p>

<p class="noindent-1">Affected agencies must withdraw any collective bargaining proposals in on-going collective bargaining which are intended to implement section 8 of EO 13837 and, as necessary, draft proposals consistent with law, the policy articulated in EO 14003, and taking into account agency-specific circumstances, as appropriate. This includes any related matter currently pending before the FMCS and the FSIP.</p>
