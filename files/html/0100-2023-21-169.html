<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-167"><span class="space">5.</span> Onset of Disability Annuity Payment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">For disability retirement, the usual rule, explained in <span class="Italic">Seacer v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 180, 182-83 &#x00B6; 6-8 (2000), is that the annuity commences the day after separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ erred in determining that OPM was required to commence payment of the appellant's disability retirement annuity while the appellant was in pay status. The Board may order OPM to make retirement payments only in accordance with the terms of the retirement statutes. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990). The commencement date of retirement annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The annuity of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;an employee or Member retiring under section 8337 of this title due to a disability; shall commence on the day after separation from the service or the day after pay ceases and the service and age or disability requirements for title to annuity are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.701(b)(2). Thus, by statute a disability retirement annuity commences on the day after the annuitant's separation from service or the day after pay ceases. <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 324, 327 (1991). Here, the appellant's separation date and last day in pay status was September 15, 1999. Consequently, OPM properly began her annuity effective September 16, 1999.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ explained in her compliance Recommendation that she required OPM, in the Initial Decision, to grant the annuity effective the appellant's last day in full-time status "to order compensation for the loss of full-time salary that the appellant endured as a result of OPM's erroneous finding...that the part-time placement constituted reasonable accommodation." This was error. This case is indistinguishable from the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Riggs v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 709 F.2d 1486 (Fed. Cir. 1983). There, the employee remained in active duty pending OPM's decision on his disability retirement application and his subsequent Board appeal. While his appeal was pending before the Federal Circuit, OPM reexamined his application in light of new evidence and granted the disability retirement annuity. The employee argued that he was entitled to the annuity retroactive the date of his first application. The Federal Circuit disagreed. The Court held that the employee was not entitled to an annuity until he met all the statutory preconditions, which included his separation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1488; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b). Noting the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury, the court ruled that OPM's erroneous decision did not estop the government from enforcing section 8345(b)'s requirement that a disabled employee be separated before an annuity may commence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hanson</span>, 450 U.S. 785, 788 (1981)). As in <span class="Italic">Riggs</span>, the Board must enforce the statutory requirements for the payment of an annuity. We may not order OPM to pay the appellant an annuity before she was separated from the service. Nor do we possess other authority to order OPM to compensate her for the effects of its erroneous decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM commenced the appellant's annuity the day following her separation and last day of pay. Accordingly, we find OPM in compliance with the final order of the Board reversing OPM's decision denying the appellant a disability retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4393"></span><span class="Italic">Riggs v. OPM</span>, 709 F.2d 1486, 1487-89 (Fed. Cir. 1983), determined that a disability annuity cannot be paid until the date of separation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Walter E. Riggs, the petitioner, a long time revenue agent of the Internal Revenue Service, applied June 29, 1979, for a disability retirement, asserting he was unable to remain on active duty because back problems had made it painful for him to sit for long periods. Favorable action would have entitled him to an annuity under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8345, which by subsection (b) would commence the day after he was separated from the service. He did not then separate himself, however, but remained on active duty pending confirmation by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), respondent, that he was disabled.&#8197;...Under date of November 2, 1982, the OPM notified Mr. Riggs it had concluded he was disabled within the meaning of the law. It appears he has now qualified for the annuity by separating from the service as the statute requires, and either is receiving the annuity, or shortly will be, needing no further prospective assistance from the MSPB or from ourselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only appeal issue not mooted is whether Mr. Riggs is entitled to receive the annuity retroactive to the date of first application....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is convenient to consider first the issue whether Mr. Riggs was entitled to disability annuity on the date of his application or any subsequent date while he was still on active service. Our conclusion is that he was not and the MSPB could not legally have so held. Other issues have been discussed, but the above conclusion makes it superfluous for us to address them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fatal defect in Mr. Riggs' position is that by express provision of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8345(b) the annuity cannot start until he separates from his civil service position. No estoppel can alter the effect that must result from his failure to meet a statutory precondition. The closest authority on the facts is <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hansen,</span> 450 U.S. 785, 101 S. Ct. 1468, 67 L. Ed.2d 685 (1981). In that case, a person otherwise eligible for "mother's insurance benefits" under the Social Security Act could actually receive the benefits only upon written application. She did not file the application because a field representative of the Social Security Administration erroneously told her she was ineligible. The issue, as here, was whether the erroneous ruling, and failure to meet the precondition because of the erroneous ruling, estopped the government from enforcing the statutory precondition. Held, it did not. The Court referred at 788 to "the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury." It cited numerous authorities that need not be repeated here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Broad Avenue Laundry and Tailoring Co. v. United States,</span> 681 F.2d 746, 748 (Ct. Cl. 1982), our predecessor court commented on the state in which <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hansen</span> left the law, pointing out that it was not written to close the door on all possible estoppels. The Court of Claims allowed relief in a case not involving a statutory prerequisite to entitlement. It commented, however:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The effort to use an official's errors to avoid compliance with an affirmative prerequisite to an entitlement, is a sure loser. A classic case in this court is <span class="Italic">Montilla v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 48, 457 F.2d 978 (1972), where the reservist claimant sought to use the alleged erroneous statement of an Army officer to obtain entitlement to military retirement pay without earning "points" by training duty as the law requires. * * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Riggs' claim is clothed with most dignity by an estoppel theory, and if he cannot, as we conclude, prevail on that ground, there is no other that serves his purpose better.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We may add the rule of <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan,</span> 424 U.S. 392, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed.2d 114 (1976) that the creation of financial liabilities by Congress against the public treasury cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed. Such unequivocal expression cannot be found in a statutory provision establishing an unmet prerequisite to entitlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This really ends the matter, but we respond to petitioner's citation of a decision of the former Court of Claims as supporting his position. His reliance is mistaken, however. The case is <span class="Italic">Ellis v. United States,</span> 657 F.2d 1178 (Ct. Cl. 1981). Mr. Ellis, a U.S. Navy civil service fireman, retired and claimed entitlement to the annuity allowed firemen, with some other hazardous occupations, on the basis of a shortened service period. The agency allowed the annuity as claimed, but the decision was administratively reversed and Mr. Ellis was notified he would cease receiving the annuity, but could return to his employment to serve the remainder of his qualifying time. This was on the alleged ground he was not a fireman, which ground the court afterwards rejected. 610 F.2d 760, 222 Ct. Cl. 65 (1979). The later decision previously cited was after remand for determination of quantum. The Court of Claims rejected a government contention that Mr. Ellis could not recover his annuity that accrued while reemployed. The government argued that he was a constructive reemployed annuitant during that period under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8344. But that law does not suspend the annuity during reemployment. Rather, it allows the annuity to continue at the established rate. A deduction is to be made from the pay of the position in which reemployed, equal to the annuity, and paid over to replenish the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) from which the annuity is paid. This circular movement of funds is set up to prevent the Fund being depleted by its payments to reemployed annuitants. Section 8344 was not literally applicable to the case, but defendant argued it was constructively applicable, that is, that Mr. Ellis' combined monthly pay equitably should not exceed the total combined amounts that would have been payable to him if he had willingly become a reemployed annuitant. The court responded that the statute stemmed from a congressional purpose to discourage reemployment of annuitants and prevent depletion of the Fund in paying annuities to them. Neither purpose was served by constructive extension of the statute to a case it did not literally cover. The discouragement purpose was not effectuated if a person could become a reemployed annuitant without his knowledge or that of the employing agency. On the other hand, the Fund was not depleted. It had not been depleted during reemployment, as no annuity was paid. It would not be depleted by award of full damages for illegal nonpayment of the annuity, because judgments of the Court of Claims of this kind were paid out of an appropriation to pay such judgments, and not directly or indirectly out of the Fund.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the facts of <span class="Italic">Ellis</span> nor the reasoning can be used as a precedent in the very different case we have here. Mr. Ellis did not fail to perform any prerequisite to his receipt of annuity. He had left the service as Sec. 8345(b) required. Neither that nor any other statute demanded he stay out of the service to continue receiving the annuity. To the exact contrary, Sec. 8344 provided expressly that if reemployed, the annuity continued. The case therefore teaches nothing to modify the decisive impact of <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Hansen.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, that we lack authority, as did the MSPB, to allow the annuity for periods preceding separation. Accordingly, the decision of the MSPB is affirmed.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yost v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 309, 310-13 &#x00B6; 4-11 (2002), addressing the date of the onset of disability annuity payments, concluded that the payments cannot be made until the time the appellant becomes disabled, even if there is a prior period when the appellant was not in pay status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed the instant petition for enforcement claiming that OPM incorrectly calculated her annuity by using the date of her second application, June 23, 1999, as the commencement date for the annuity. The appellant claimed that under the governing statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b), the proper commencement date is the day after her pay ceased, November 12, 1996. OPM argued that November 12, 1996, was not the proper commencement date for the appellant's annuity because s he was not disabled at that time, as the Board found in the final decision on her first application for disability retirement. The administrative judge agreed with the appellant, and instructed OPM to recompute the appellant's annuity using the day after her pay ceased as the commencement date....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that the administrative judge erred by ordering OPM to calculate the appellant's annuity commencing on the day after her pay ceased because the appellant was not disabled at that time. Therefore, we do not adopt the Recommendation. However, we find that OPM improperly chose the date of the appellant's second application as the commencement date. Thus, we find the agency in noncompliance and grant the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may order OPM to make annuity payments only in accordance with the terms of the retirement statutes. <span class="Italic">Seacer v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 87 MSPR 180, 182 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990)). The statute governing the commencement date for annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) is 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b). That statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The annuity of...an employee or Member retiring under section 8337 of this title due to a disability; shall commence on the day after separation from the service or the day after pay ceases and the service and...disability requirements for title to annuity are met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(b)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge interpreted the phrase "and the service and...disability requirements for title to an annuity are met" in section 8345(b)<span id="Page_4394"></span>(2)(B) as merely a third prerequisite to obtaining an annuity that does not affect either of the commencing dates identified earlier in the sentence. Under this reading, the administrative judge found that the appellant's annuity should commence on either the date after the appellant's separation or the date after her pay ceased, without regard to whether she satisfied the disability requirement of the statute at that time. The administrative judge ordered OPM to calculate the appellant's annuity commencing on the date after her pay ceased, November 12, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the administrative judge misinterpreted section 8345(b)(2)(B), and urges the Board to adopt its interpretation of the statute as providing that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A disability annuity commences, at the employee's option, on the date <span class="Italic">after</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Separation from service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Pay ceases and the employee meets the requirements for title to an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, CSRS and FERS Handbook for Personnel and Payroll Offices &#x00A7; 60A9.1-4B (Apr. 1998). We agree with OPM's interpretation of section 8345(b)(2)(B). Entitlement to a disability retirement annuity is governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), which provides: "[a]n employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled will be retired." The plain import of section 8337(a) is that an employee becomes entitled to a disability retirement annuity only after he has become disabled, Because OPM may not pay an annuity to an employee who is not entitled to it, section 8345(b)(2)(B) must be read as providing that a disability retirement annuity commences on the date after pay ceases <span class="Italic">and</span> the employee satisfies the service and disability requirements for eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Yost I,</span> which issued on May 14, 1998, the administrative judge held that the appellant was not disabled at that time. Thus, by ordering OPM to commence the appellant's annuity on November 12, 1996, eighteen months earlier than the date of <span class="Italic">Yost I,</span> the administrative judge ordered OPM to pay the appellant annuity before she became entitled to it. For this reason the administrative judge's order was contrary to statute. <span class="Italic">Seacer,</span> at &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, like here, the employee's pay ceased before he became disabled, OPM construes section 8345(b)(2)(B) as providing that the annuity shall commence once the employee becomes disabled rather than requiring that the annuity shall not commence until after the employee's separation. This interpretation seems to us a reasonable reading of the statute. However, we cannot agree with OPM's choice of the date of the appellant's second retirement application as the commencement date for her annuity. OPM concedes that this choice was arbitrary. Nothing in the record supports a finding that the appellant became disabled on or about June 23, 1999. Nor does the initial decision awarding the appellant an annuity identify a particular date on which she became disabled. <span class="Italic">See Yost II.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the medical evidence submitted in the appeal on the merits and have determined an event following the date of the hearing in the appellant's first appeal that caused her condition to deteriorate significantly: the loss of her home in July or August 1998. Prior to this time, in a June 12, 1998, report, the appellant's psychiatrist, Dr. Millet, described the appellant's condition as stable. Similarly, in a July 14, 1998, report, the appellant's physician, Dr. Carey, described her as "generally doing well, except she [continues] to have symptoms." However, on July 28, Dr. Millet found that the appellant's condition had worsened, and noted her home sale. In an August 11 report, Dr. Carey stated that "she has become much more irritable and restless and is very distraught." On September 1, Dr. Millet reported that the appellant's sale of her home caused her symptoms of depression to worsen. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Dr. Millet stated, "I do not expect much improvement in her current situation of extreme social stressors. The best I expect is for her to stay stable. Because her symptoms have gone on for so long while her disability claims are being settled she may not improve significantly even if findings are favorable toward [her]." On September 9, 1998, Dr. Carey again noted the exacerbation of the appellant's physical symptoms. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The medical evidence does not reflect any significant change in the appellant's condition after this time, and the administrative judge largely relied on medical reports prepared after this time to find the appellant disabled. <span class="Italic">Yost II</span> at 5-8. Consequently, we find that for the purposes of determining the commencement date of the annuity, the appellant was disabled at the time of Dr. Millet's September 1, 1998, report and that OPM should use this date as the commencement date for the appellant's annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 563, 566-68 &#x00B6; 7-12 (2005), reiterated that a grant of a disability retirement causes the separation of the employee, and the annuity can be granted before separation if the employee is in a nonpay status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, OPM argues that the Board misconstrued the pertinent statutory provisions and erred in finding that the appellant was entitled to a disability retirement annuity even though she was not separated from the civil service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself, which governs absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980). Under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), [a]n employee who completes at least 18 months of civilian service creditable under section 8411 and has become disabled <span class="Italic">shall be retired</span> on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(1)(A) (emphasis supplied). The retired employee becomes an annuitant, which is defined as a <span class="Italic">former</span> employee or Member who, on the basis of that individual's service, meets all requirements for title to an annuity under subchapter II or V of this chapter and files claims therefor. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(2) (emphasis supplied). Subchapter V of chapter 84 sets forth the provisions relating to disability retirement under FERS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that these provisions require an employee to retire or separate from his employing agency after OPM has granted an employee's application for disability annuity. A voluntary retirement, like a resignation, results in the employee's complete separation from the service a separation which, after it becomes effective, may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn at his option. <span class="Italic">Collier v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 38, 42 (1985) <span class="Italic">(</span>quoting<span class="Italic"> Taylor v. United States,</span> 591 F.2d 688, 690 (Ct. Cl. 1979)), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 795 F.2d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table). Thus, the administrative judge was right to caution the appellant's representative that being awarded a disability retirement would cause the appellant to be separated from her employer; she would no longer be a federal employee, but an annuitant with no right to reemployment. The administrative judge later erred, as did the Board on petition for review, by ordering OPM to approve an annuity without requiring the appellant to separate from the service. When a retirement applicant is employed, OPM may allow the annuity only upon the applicant's separation. <span class="Italic">See Riggs v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 709 F.2d 1486, 1487 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (disability retirement applicant who was on active duty qualified for annuity by separating from the service as the statute requires). <span class="Italic">See also</span> CSRS and FERS Handbook, &#x00A7; 60A6.1-2A (April 1998) (On receiving notice of allowance of disability application, the agency must not delay in establishing a date of separation in consultation with the employee).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion does not in any respect nullify the statutory provision directing that an annuity payable from the retirement fund commences on the day after separation from the service or the day after pay ceases and the requirements for title to an annuity are met in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8451. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8464(a)(1)(C). The effect of the language after the or, as the Board held in <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 324, 329 (1991), is that a disability annuitant may be entitled to receive benefits retroactive to a date prior to his separation if his pay ceased and the requirements for such an annuity were met on that earlier date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Corman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 535 (1988), illustrates these principles. Corman, a Postal employee covered by the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), applied for disability retirement on June 5, 1984. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 536. On September 13, 1984, OPM notified Corman and the U.S. Postal Service that it had approved his application, and it began paying his benefits retroactive to June 10, 1984.4<span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM instructed the Postal Service that it should separate Corman by the procedure in the Federal Personnel Manual or by its instructions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Postmaster, however, advised OPM that Corman wished to remain in the Postal Service and that they were awaiting a medical release. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM responded by again sending Corman and the Postal Service a notice requesting that Corman be separated. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On January 17, 1985, Corman notified OPM that his physical condition had improved and that he wished to return to work and withdraw from his retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Corman returned to work at the end of February 1985. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM sought recovery of the benefits paid to Corman. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 537. Corman appealed to the Board and argued that he was entitled to the benefits because he was disabled during that time period and his request for a "withdrawal" was, in effect, a request that his disability annuity be discontinued, not withdrawn, because he had recovered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> OPM argued, as it does in the instant case, that because Corman was not separated from federal employment, he did not qualify for disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board agreed with OPM and ordered Corman to repay the benefits, finding that his "pay did not cease, because he returned to work in February 1985, and [he] was not separated from federal employment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 538. The Board cited 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(9), which, like section 8401(2), defines an "annuitant" as a "former employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that pay ceases, for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8464(a)(1)(C), on the applicant's last day in pay status prior to the date of separation. Pay has not ceased if the applicant returned to a pay status prior to his or her separation. <span class="Italic">Corman,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. at 538. Thus, the appellant does not qualify for benefits prior to April 15, 2003, because she returned to a pay status on that date.</p>
