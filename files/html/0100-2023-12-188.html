<p class="Body-Text">The assertion that the untimeliness of a PFR is due solely to the alleged professional failings of the appellant's chosen representative does not constitute good cause for waiving the regulatory time limit. <span class="Italic">Love v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 262, 264 (1987). It matters not that the representative is a union representative rather than an attorney. <span class="Italic">See Washington v. GPO,</span> DC-0752-10-0245-I-1 (NP 10/15/2010) ("In addition, the appellant's representative was a union official who had an affirmative obligation to be familiar with the Board's regulatory deadlines, <span class="Italic">see Soleto v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 253, 256 (1993), whose excuse for his delay in filing this appeal was entirely unpersuasive."). Many decisions unfavorably address filing delays by representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, DC-0432-11-0815-I-2 (NP 8/6/2013) (a brief delay in filing the PFR was not excused because counsel was involved in another MSPB hearing); <span class="Italic">Retzler v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 114 MSPR 361, 363 &#x00B6; 5, 2010 MSPB 134 (2010) (attorney allegedly failed to note the due date for the PFR on his calendar). The appellant is personally responsible for the prosecution of the appeal and must remain in close communication with his representative to ensure that a timely PFR is filed. <span class="Italic">McKay v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 371, 373 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mistelske v. VA</span>, 106 MSPR 554, 558 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 213 (2007) (any neglect of a union representative was attributed to the appellant, who did not assert he failed to receive the initial decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Mistelske v. MSPB</span>, 314 Fed. Appx. 272 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP); <span class="Italic">Helmstetter v. DHS</span>, 106 MSPR 101, 105-06 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2007 MSPB 147 (2007) (despite a civil judgment against his counsel and disbarment order against the attorney, a late PFR was not excused when the appellant did not show that he tried to contact his lawyer before the filing deadline or made any other effort to ensure that the PFR would be timely filed); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 93 MSPR 147, 149 &#x00B6; 5 (2002) ("An appellant has a personal obligation to diligently monitor the progress of her appeal at all times."); <span class="Italic">Sidbury v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 5, 7 (1988) (rejecting the explanation that the appellant believed his counsel had prepared a PFR); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rotelli v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-315H-17-0113-I-1 (NP 7/15/2022) ("Regardless of the situation between the appellant and her attorney, it is well established that the right of appeal is personal to the appellant, whether or not she is represented, and she remains responsible for the prosecution and development of her appeal. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 394, &#x00B6; 5.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unexcused delay by counsel of but one day in filing a PFR was grounds for its dismissal in <span class="Italic">Lands v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 95 MSPR 593, 595-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2004); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sumrall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an initial decision on October 28, 1994, that notified the appellant that the last day for filing a petition for review was December 2. The appellant, through counsel, filed a petition for review on December 5. In response to the show cause order issued by the Board, the appellant's attorney submitted a sworn statement explaining that she was a sole practitioner, and that an unexpected increase in her workload during the week before the petition for review was due had prevented her from either filing on time or requesting an extension of the filing date. She also stated that during the week she was overworked, she was hypoglycemic or insulin resistant, unable to eat properly, and less resistant to her allergies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's attorney's assertion of a heavy workload does not constitute good cause for the delay. The Board has held that a heavy workload, even that of a sole practitioner, is not persuasive that due diligence was exercised. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Averella v.

In addition, she has not explained why her various medical conditions prevented her from filing on time or informing the Board at some point prior to the filing deadline that she needed additional time to prepare the petition for review. Indeed, as she explains in her statement, she was not so ill that she could not continue working all week on the other matters that had come up. She states that she even worked after hours on one of her other cases. She does not explain why she was unable to request an extension of the filing deadline, even at the last minute. We note that the appellant's representative does not claim, or appear to be, inexperienced in Board matters. In these circumstances, we do not find that she has shown good cause for the untimely filing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant does not appear to have been at fault in causing or contributing to the delay in this case. As the Board has consistently held, however, an appellant is responsible for the actions or inactions of her chosen representative, and a representative's failure to file a petition on time does not constitute good cause to excuse the delay....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Nor is delay justified because counsel desires to attend a course or seminar that makes it impossible to file the PFR on time.

"Administrative oversight" was not excused for a five-day delay in filing the PFR caused by the travel schedule of the agency representative.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant's July 10, 2008 petition for review was filed approximately 1 year and 9 months after the filing deadline for seeking review of the June 19, 2006 initial decision was extended to October 2, 2006. In his sworn motion to accept his petition for review as timely filed, the appellant asserts that: he was told by Sam Brinson, a paralegal for David Ross, the attorney who represented the appellant below, that a <span id="Page_1780"></span>petition for review had been filed on his behalf; and he was told by Mr. Brinson, on or about January 8, 2008, that Mr. Ross had, in fact, never filed the appellant's petition for review with the Board. The appellant then confirmed with the Board, on or about January 8, 2008, that a petition for review had never been filed on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The failure by the appellant's former attorney to timely file a petition for review, in and of itself, does not constitute good cause for the untimely filing of the appellant's petition for review because an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). However, the Board has held that a limited exception to this rule exists when an appellant has proven that his diligent efforts to prosecute his case were thwarted by his attorney's deception and negligence. <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 640, 643-45 (1990). Here, the appellant asserts that he was told by Mr. Brinson on or about October 2, 2006, that a petition for review had been filed by his attorney, Mr. Ross, and he asserts that he tried, on numerous occasions, to obtain a copy of the petition for review from Mr. Ross, but that Mr. Ross did not respond to his requests. The appellant submits copies of e-mails and letters to Mr. Ross's office to support this assertion. He also asserts that it was "usual and customary" for Mr. Ross to not provide him with copies of filings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming that the appellant's assertions on review are true that Mr. Ross, his now-former attorney, deceived him into believing that a petition for review had been filed on his behalf, such deception and/or negligence by Mr. Ross, as the appellant's designated representative, could fall within the <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> exception. However, the Board has found that, even where an appellant's representative misleads him as to the status of a filing, the appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of his appeal at all times and not leave the matter entirely to his attorney. <span class="Italic">Soleto v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 253, 256 n.2 (1993); <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 645 n.6. Here, the appellant acknowledges that his former attorney failed to provide him with a copy of his petition for review, despite his many requests, yet the appellant also acknowledges that he did not make any inquiries at the Board regarding the status of his appeal until January 2008, more than 15 months after the filing deadline had passed, and several months after he apparently began his repeated unsuccessful attempts to obtain a copy of the petition for review from his former attorney. Once the appellant confirmed with the Board, on or about January 8, 2008, that a petition for review had not been filed on his behalf, he did not file anything with the Board until February 28, 2008, when he filed a "Request to File a Petition for Review." After clarification by the appellant, the Clerk of the Board construed the appellant's February 28, 2008 filing as a motion to extend the deadline for filing, which the Clerk denied pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(e) because it was not filed before the filing deadline expired. The next filing by the appellant did not occur until approximately 6 months later, when he filed a July 10, 2008 petition for review, accompanied by a sworn motion to accept the petition as timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, even assuming that the appellant's former attorney deceived him regarding the filing status of his petition for review, the appellant has not established good cause for his untimely petition for review because his actions do not show that he exercised due diligence in monitoring the progress of his petition for review. Specifically, in the 15 months between when the appellant's petition for review was allegedly filed on his behalf and when the appellant learned that it had not been filed, the appellant could have contacted the Board to request a copy of or inquire about the status of his petition for review, especially given that his former attorney did not respond to his repeated requests for a copy of his petition for review. However, because the appellant chose not to contact the Board, he has not shown that he exercised due diligence in monitoring his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mashack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 174, &#x00B6; 8 (2004) (the appellant did not establish good cause for a 3 1/2 month delay in filing a petition for review where his representative became incapacitated and could not be reached and the appellant asserted that he did not know how to proceed, because whether or not an appellant is represented, he remains responsible for prosecuting and developing his appeal); <span class="Italic">Lamb v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 500, 503 (1995) (the appellant did not exercise due diligence where she delayed 3 months before attempting to ascertain whether her attorney had filed a petition for review on her behalf, and then delayed another 3 months before verifying with the Board whether a petition had been filed), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 603 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table); <span class="Italic">Soleto</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 256 n.2 (finding no basis to waive the filing deadline under <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> where, although the appellant contacted his attorney regarding the refiling of his petition shortly after his deficient petition was returned to him, the appellant waited several months before he made another attempt to track the progress of his petition and therefore failed to sufficiently monitor the progress of his petition for review that he believed would or had been filed on his behalf).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that one of the reasons he did not follow up with the Board earlier regarding the status of his petition for review was because he "realized from another matter in this case" that it takes the Board "approximately one year" to issue a decision; thus, he trusted that his petition for review was being processed by his former attorney and the Board. This assertion is unavailing. The record supports the appellant's implicit assertion that he was previously involved in petition for review proceedings before the Board, i.e., with respect to two of the appeals that are at issue in this case, and, therefore, he should have been aware that the Clerk of the Board sends an acknowledgment notice to all parties, including an appellant and his designated representative, when a petition for review is filed with the Board. Thus, the appellant should have been aware that perhaps something with his petition for review was amiss when his attorney failed to respond to any of his requests for a copy of the petition and when he failed to receive any correspondence from the Board acknowledging that a petition for review had been filed on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Marino v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 8 (2004) (rejecting the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant's assertion in support of his untimely petition for review that he did not understand all of the procedures for filing a petition for review where the appellant had previously filed a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petition for review and appealed the Board's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 122 Fed. Appx. 480 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further asserts that he was unable to follow up with his former attorney or with the Board regarding the status of his petition for review due to his "extreme incapacitation" as a result of his medical conditions. The Board will find good cause for an untimely filing when a party demonstrates that he was unable to timely file his petition due to illness, or mental or physical incapacity. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 5 (2002); <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998). Where, as here, the appellant states that the reason for a filing delay is illness, he must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis. <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 437-38. This requires informing the appellant that he must identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness, submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period, and explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing the petition or requesting an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 469, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant was informed by the Clerk of the Board of the requirements for establishing that his illness affected his ability to timely file his petition for review. <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. at 437. In response, the appellant submits, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a June 18, 2008 letter from Dr. Irvin S. Belzer, his general practitioner. Dr. Belzer asserts that: it was recently discovered that the appellant suffers from sleep apnea and Type II diabetes; and these two medical conditions, and the appellant's adjustment to medications to treat these conditions, have left the appellant with "extreme fatigue" and difficulty concentrating, which would prevent the appellant from "participating in his legal process in a timely manner."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also submits a March 3, 2008 letter from Dr. Randall W. Fehr, who has treated the appellant since March 23, 2000, for the following conditions: major depressive disorder; post-traumatic stress disorder; generalized anxiety order; and panic disorder. Dr. Fehr asserts that the appellant's symptoms worsened "[l]ast year," and that the appellant's conditions and the side-effects of his various treatments, including electro-shock therapy, can "cause temporary severe cognitive problems which have substantially limited [the appellant's] ability to function." Dr. Fehr opined that, due to the appellant's "severe impairments," he has not been able to "usefully follow and manage" the legal process involved with his Board appeals; Dr. Fehr also opined, however, that the appellant "[r]ecently...experienced a decrease in the intensity of his condition" and may be "more able to meaningfully attend to his legal issues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that his medical conditions establish good cause to excuse his delay in filing his petition for review. Although the appellant asserts that he was hospitalized for his mental and emotional problems, he failed to provide any dates or supporting documentation regarding these alleged hospitalizations. Additionally, the supporting documents submitted by the appellant on review do not sufficiently explain how his illnesses prevented him from timely filing his petition for review or exercising due diligence through a timely inquiry to the Board regarding the status of his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Department of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, &#x00B6; 23 (2006) (finding that a letter by the appellant's physician that the appellant suffered from depression and other conditions was insufficient to justify the entire 3-year delay in filing a petition for review where the letter failed to state that the appellant's condition was so severe that he could not file a petition for review or seek help to do so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant asserts on review that he made "weekly" attempts to get in touch with his former attorney via telephone or e-mail to inquire about receiving a copy of his petition for review and other documents in his case. The appellant also asserts that, during this period of time, he contacted the Florida Bar, where his former attorney is a member, to seek its help in obtaining a response from his former attorney. Thus, <span id="Page_1781"></span>the appellant's failure to exercise due diligence to contact the Board and inquire about the status of his petition for review cannot be explained by his medical conditions because his undisputed assertions on review show that, despite his medical conditions, he was able to repeatedly contact his attorney's office, as well as the Florida State Bar, regarding his inquiry about his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wirzberger v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9 (the appellant failed to show that her medical condition was responsible for the 1-year delay in filing a petition for review where the record showed that, although she may have been incapacitated by her bipolar disorder for an interval of time early in the 1-year period, her subsequent ability to return to work during the 1-year period shows that, at that point, her medical condition no longer prevented her from filing a petition for review), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 212 Fed. Appx. 965 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's assertion that the filing of his petition for review was further delayed by his difficulty in obtaining new legal representation is also unavailing. The Board has held that an appellant's inability to find a representative does not establish good cause for a delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See Uson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 402, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 326 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">DeGraaff v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 343, 346 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, although the appellant's former attorney may have deceived him with respect to whether a petition for review had been filed on his behalf, his submissions on review do not show that he exercised due diligence in monitoring the status of his petition for review or that his medical conditions prevented him from monitoring the status or from making timely inquiries of the Board to determine whether his former attorney had actually filed a petition for review on his behalf. Further, once the appellant confirmed in January 2008 that a petition for review had not been filed on his behalf, he did not exercise due diligence by waiting another 6 months before filing his petition with the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-16-0664-I-1 (NP 4/13/2023) (inaction by union official: "He has not shown that he personally took any action to confirm that an appeal had been filed on his behalf during the 46-day period between his receipt of the removal decision and the deadline for filing a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 13."); <span class="Italic">Jonson v. FDIC</span>, PH-0752-13-0236-B-1 (NP 9/20/2016) ("Nonetheless, even if an appellant's representative misleads him as to the status of a filing, the appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of his appeal at all times and not leave the matter entirely to his attorney. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 12."; "Despite repeated notifications that his attorney was not responding to the FDIC's discovery and discovery-related motions and orders, the appellant waited until after the administrative judge imposed sanctions, 4 months after initially learning that his attorney had not responded to the FDIC's discovery, to terminate his attorney and hire a new one.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay is not excused because an attorney is alleged to have incorrectly advised the appellant that he had no legal basis for filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">Puckett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 25, 27 (1992). Confusion by an attorney's staff as to the appropriate regulation governing the timing of a PFR from an arbitration award was held not to excuse a four-day delay. <span class="Italic">Jordon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 213, 215 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Overton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 326, 327 (1990) (usual standards of timeliness apply to the review of an arbitration decision; inadequate legal representation was no excuse). That counsel's staff misplaced a Board order does not excuse a late PFR. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 41 MSPR 35, 37 (1989). If the appellant has consulted with more than one attorney, confusion or inaction among them leading to a late PFR does not justify the late submission. <span class="Italic">Mallory v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 519, 521 (1989) (immaterial that the appellant may have been under the impression that an attorney would file a case in court for her). The Board does not appear to excuse delays caused by breakdowns in office equipment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bane v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 13 (1993) (a counsel fee petition); <span class="Italic">Branch v. DOD</span>, 51 MSPR 537, 539 (1991) ("appellant's claim of unanticipated office problems on the last possible day for filing does not demonstrate good cause for waiver of the filing deadline" for a PFR); <span class="Italic">De La Garza v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 357, 358 (1990) (not excusing delay, following initial grant of extension, caused by problems with word processing equipment and delays in completing cite-checking).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the appellant and his representative are legally unskilled does not relieve the appellant of the responsibility for timely filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">Steele v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 327, 329 (1990). Misrepresentation by an "employment law consultant" is not reason enough to avoid the consequences of the appellant's choice and excuse the failure to file a timely PFR. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 8 MSPR 133, 134, 7 MSPB 617 (1981). The Board did not excuse a delay of 11 months in filing the PFR after the appellant relied on a nondesignated representative to file the petition. <span class="Italic">Garra v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 46, 47 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The seemingly absolute preclusion against consideration of a representative's neglect in filing an administrative petition creates an unduly harsh result, particularly because the Board reopens cases at will and because 5 USC 7701(e) allows the Board to extend the time for filing a PFR for "good cause," an elastic concept that the Board defeats through its inelastic constructions. MSPB case management presents a problem if appeals cannot be considered to have been finally decided because someday some appellant will claim that he received inadequate representation or no representation at all. But if the period of delay is short and the appellant's reliance upon a representative is reasonable, without a demonstration of prejudice there seems no compelling reason to deny appellant a fair review of his appeal. If necessary the Board can penalize those who cause delays by fashioning a remedy--for successful appellants--reducing back pay by the amount of time consumed in delays resulting from no fault of the employer. Appellants lack the extraordinary resources available to agencies to litigate adverse action cases; the Board should recognize the considerable problems facing the appellant who, due to lack of income resulting from discharge from a federal job, relies either on his own wits, or who has the resources to retain counsel who is then relied on properly to prosecute an appeal or PFR. [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-106.html#sec2-104">Delay Not Excused</a>," for appeals delayed through error of a representative.]</p>
