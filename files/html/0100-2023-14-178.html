<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-179"><span class="space">5.</span> Transcript or Record of Interrogation</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l INS Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 8 FLRA 347, 363 (1982), declared nonnegotiable a requirement that if a recording is made of an interview, the employee or the representative will be allowed to record the proceedings; if a transcript is made, the union will receive a copy. The procedure allowed the union access to confidential information of a sensitive and personal nature. The agency would then lose control of that information, in violation of the agency's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). The proposal extended to every interview with every employee, represented or not. A proposal was negotiable that an employee be provided a copy of the transcript of an interview of the employee that was tape recorded or stenographically recorded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 983, 994 (1982). But a proposal to allow employees the right to receive audio or videotape or paper transcripts of investigatory interviews interfered with the agency's right to determine its internal security and was determined not to constitute an appropriate arrangement in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1186-87 (1999) (Provision 9), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Provision Affects Management's Right to Determine its Internal Security</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., American Federation of Government Employees, Federal Prison Council 33 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1115 (1996).... [W]here management shows a link, or reasonable connection, between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and a practice designed to implement <span id="page_747"></span>that objective, a proposal or provision that conflicts with the practice affects management's right under section 7106(a)(1). The right includes the authority to determine the investigative techniques management will employ to attain its internal security objectives. <span class="Italic">See National Association of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, Locals R14-22 and R14-89 and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, U.S. Army</span> <span class="Italic">Air Defense Artillery Center and Fort Bliss, Fort Bliss,</span> <span class="Italic">Texas, </span>45 FLRA 949, 960 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Fort Bliss).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that the Agency established a sufficient link between its practice of determining case-by-case whether to withhold or delay releasing tapes and its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property or operations against internal and external risks. In this connection, an Agency witness testified at the hearing that releasing video or audio tapes of interviews prior to the conclusion of the interview process could compromise the Agency's internal security by disclosing not only the "essence" of the investigation but also such matters as "the tempo of the interviews, the thrust of the actual questions, indeed, what questions are not asked."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's testimony indicates that releasing a tape or transcript before the completion of an investigation could result in a future witness becoming aware of the tempo of the questioning, the exact wording of a particular question, and the type of questions to expect. The Union contends that regardless of whether the Agency releases a tape or transcript a future witness may become aware of the content of the interview and that releasing the tape or transcript does not increase the risk of disclosure. Although it is clear that a questioned employee <span class="Italic">could </span>disclose information he or she recalls regarding the interview without a tape or transcript, that fact does not render unreasonable the connection asserted by the Agency between release of a tape or transcript and the risk of compromising the integrity of an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is reasonable to conclude that the potential for disclosing aspects of the interview is increased if interviewees are provided with tapes or transcripts of the interviews showing the actual content of the interview.&#x2003;The Union's bare assertion, in this regard, that disclosure of the tape or transcript would not increase the risk of disclosure does not support a conclusion to the contrary. Accordingly, we find in agreement with the Judge, that the Agency has demonstrated a sufficient link between its goal of safeguarding its personnel, property, or operations and its practice of determining case-by-case whether to release tapes or transcripts of interviews before the completion of an investigation. The prospect that the risk of disclosure may exist, even without a tape or transcript being released, does not, in our view, provide a basis to find that the connection drawn by the Agency is not reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and <span class="Italic">INS</span> to support its claim that Provision 9 does not affect the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices is misplaced. With regard to <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the Union acknowledges that the Authority's decision did not address the subsection of the disputed provision that is similar to Provision 9. While the Union is correct that "the Authority could have reviewed the subsection <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>," the fact remains that the Authority did not do so. With regard to <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the Authority stated, in <span class="Italic">dicta</span>, that a proposal merely incorporating into the parties' agreement an existing practice--which the agency did not challenge on the basis of its right to determine its internal security practices--would not affect the agency's right. <span class="Italic">See INS</span>, 8 FLRA at 364. Even assuming that this <span class="Italic">dicta</span> is a correct construction of the law, the Agency here, unlike the agency in <span class="Italic">INS</span>, specifically asserts that the practice sought to be established in the parties' agreement affects its right to determine its internal security practices. Thus, <span class="Italic">INS</span> does not support the Union's position.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Provision is Not an Appropriate Arrangement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained in our discussion of Provision 1, the test for determining whether a proposal or provision is within the duty to bargain under 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">KANG. </span>Under that test, the Authority initially determines whether the proposal or provision is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. An arrangement must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States Department of the Treasury, </span>Office <span class="Italic">of the Chief</span> <span class="Italic">Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA, </span>96.0 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). To establish that a proposal or provision is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31. Proposals or provisions that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Federation of Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 2015 and U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior, National Park Service, Washington, D.C.,</span> 53 FLRA 967, 973 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, an arrangement must be tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering those adverse effects. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA at 184. That is, section 7106(b)(3) brings within the duty to bargain proposals that provide "balm" to be administered "only to hurts arising from" the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Interior, Minerals Management Service v. FLRA,</span> 969 F.2d 1158, 1162 (D.C. Cir. 1992). Section 7106(b)(3) does not bring within the duty to bargain proposals that are so broad in their sweep that the "balm" afforded would be applied to employees indiscriminately without regard to whether the group as a whole is likely to suffer adverse effects as a consequence of management action under section 7106. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., NTEU, Chapter 243, </span>49 FLRA at 184.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 9 is intended as an arrangement for employees who may be adversely affected by management's right to determine its internal security by conducting investigations. The adverse effect, according to the Union, would arise from a misrepresentation, intentional and/or unintentional, of an employee's testimony. We conclude that the adverse effect that the Union seeks to mitigate is speculative. The Union has not demonstrated that there is any reasonable likelihood that Agency representatives would misrepresent testimony. In addition, Provision 9 would require the Agency to provide tape recordings or stenographic records to all employees whose testimony is tape recorded or transcribed, whether or not those employees are ever charged with wrongdoing or whether or not their testimony is ever used. Accordingly, even if the adverse effects were not speculative, the provision is not sufficiently tailored to ameliorate those adverse effects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the provision is not an arrangement, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). As a result, Provision 9 is not an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals 33 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 64 FLRA 728, 729-31 (2010), concluded that a proposal was negotiable that, on request, employees immediately be provided a copy of affidavits they provide in the course of an official investigation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, the right to determine internal security practices includes an agency's right to determine the policies and practices that are necessary to safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal and external risks. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Fed. Prison Council 33</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1115 (1996) (citation omitted) (<span class="Italic">AFGE-FPC 33</span>). Techniques aimed at obtaining truthful and reliable information from interviewees constitute internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (proposal that conflicted with agency's technique of not informing interviewees not suspected of misconduct of their <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> rights affected management rights); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1300</span>, 18 FLRA 789, 798 (1985) (proposal barring sworn statements in certain circumstances affected management right to determine internal security practices).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has concluded that where management shows a link, or a reasonable connection, between its objective of safeguarding its personnel, physical property, or operations and an investigative technique designed to implement that objective, a proposal that "conflicts with" that investigative technique affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">AFGE-FPC 33</span>, 51 FLRA at 1115. Once a link has been established, the Authority will not review the merits of an agency's plan in the course of resolving a negotiability dispute. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2143</span>, 48 FLRA 41, 44 (1993) (citations omitted).[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also, e.g., AFGE, Local 171, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 64 FLRA 275, 277 (2009) (noting special security concerns at federal correctional facilities); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals, Local 919</span>, 42 FLRA 1295, 1300 (1991) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has established the requisite link between its internal security objective of maintaining the integrity of the investigatory process and its practice of not providing witnesses with copies of their affidavits.&#x2003;In this regard, the Agency explains that an investigator may, during the course an investigation, decide to re-interview a witness to check the consistency of the witness's statements. The Agency contends that an investigator must be able to consider the possible need to conduct such a check before being required to release a witness's affidavit, to protect the integrity of an investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has established a reasonable connection between its practice of not providing witnesses with their affidavits during the course of an investigation and the Agency's aim of obtaining reliable information from interviewees. Because the Union's proposal would conflict with the Agency's investigative technique of not releasing affidavits, we find that the proposal affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The proposal is an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute is nevertheless negotiable if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. A proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement if it is: (1) intended as <span id="page_748"></span>an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The proposal is an arrangement</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two requirements that must be met to establish that a proposal satisfies the first part of the appropriate arrangement test; i.e., that the proposal is an arrangement. First, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights and how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Proposals that address speculative or hypothetical concerns do not constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 55 FLRA 1174, 1187 (1999). Second, an arrangement must be sufficiently tailored to compensate or benefit employees suffering those adverse effects. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the proposal is an arrangement.&#x2003;As to an arrangement's first requirement, the record supports the Union's claims that the Agency's practice of withholding affidavits adversely affects employees. Addressing these adverse effects, the Union attaches to its supplemental response two uncontroverted statements from Union representatives. The first statement documents an instance in which a witness was disciplined based on a statement in an affidavit that the witness did not recall making. Moreover, the witness was uncertain whether the affidavit was the one he signed or whether it had been changed. The Union argues that if the witness had a copy of his original affidavit, he would have been able to prove that the statement for which he was disciplined was not a statement he made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second uncontroverted statement that the Union submitted also addresses the issue of altered affidavits.&#x2003;According to the statement, an employee was investigated in connection with his detention by local police. The employee subsequently gave a statement to an Agency investigator. However, it was later determined that the investigator altered the employee's statement and forged the employee's signature. The Union cites this example as evidence that such alterations occur. The Union also points out that such occurrences may affect administrative proceedings involving employees, if not detected.<span class="Italic"> </span>We agree, and find that the proposal addresses adverse effects on employees flowing from the exercise of management's rights, and that those effects are not speculative or hypothetical.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the proposal satisfies the second "arrangement" requirement; that it be sufficiently tailored. The Authority has held that proposals "intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements negotiable under [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(3)." <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 191 (1994). In particular, such "prophylactic" proposals will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to determine reliably which employees will be adversely affected by an agency action so as to draft a proposal to apply only to those employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>An arrangement need not "target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Service v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1163 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The instant proposal is prophylactic in that it would eliminate the possibility that employees will be adversely affected by being disciplined based on affidavits that may have been altered or forged.&#x2003;Moreover, the proposal is tailored to the extent possible. It is only operative where employees have given affidavits as part of an investigation. In addition, the Agency does not argue that the proposal could be more narrowly focused on employees who would later be faced with the need to be able to confirm prior testimony recorded in an affidavit. Therefore, we conclude that this proposal is sufficiently tailored and that the proposal is an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The arrangement is appropriate</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Authority finds that a proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 981 (2004). The Authority does this by weighing the benefits afforded employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with management's rights. The proposal would benefit employees by providing assurance that where disciplinary action is proposed based on an employee's affidavit, that the affidavit is not altered or forged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the burden on management's rights, the Agency makes only the general claim that the proposal excessively interferes. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.32(b) (The agency has the burden of raising and supporting arguments that the proposal or provision is outside the duty to bargain). Moreover, as the Union argues, the Agency retains complete control of investigations in virtually all respects. The only information the proposal requires the Agency to release is information provided by employees and then only to the particular employee who provided the information. Further, the Agency retains complete authority over all other aspects of the investigative process, including who will be interviewed, when interviews and re-interviews will take place, what the scope of interviews will be, and what materials, including a copy of a prior affidavit, a witness would be prohibited from bringing to an interview or re-interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Weighing the benefits and burdens, we find that the benefits to employees of the protection the proposal would provide are significant. By contrast, the burden the proposal places on management's rights, which the Agency does not explain in any detail, is relatively insignificant.[4] We therefore conclude that the proposal's benefits outweigh its burdens, and that the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
