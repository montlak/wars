<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-388"><span class="space">4.</span> Cancelation or Reconsideration of Reassignments; Return Rights</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal that management offer employees who were geographically reassigned vacancies at the old duty station at the same or lower pay rate excessively interfered with management's right to make selections for vacancies. The proposal left management with no discretion in filling the vacancies or in determining qualifications of employees for the positions. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 905, 906-08 (1986). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-345.html#sec6-346">Return from Promotions Outside the Unit</a>."] Proposal 5 was negotiable in <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 47 FLRA 370, 379-80, 382 (1993), providing a degree of procedural protection against reassignments that could adversely affect employees' careers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NRC has determined that it will not reassign any resident inspector before the end of his/her duty, based on an assumed loss of objectivity criteria without providing the employee involved with an opportunity to present his/her response to charges of loss of objectivity. Whenever the NRC obtains evidence that an inspector is no longer performing his/her duties in an objective manner, it shall provide the employee with a formal notice containing a listing of all known examples where the employee's conduct, judgement [sic], and/or performance are not compatible with the standards of the resident inspector program, with specific[ ] cites to the areas of the program where a deficiency was found. The employee will be given reasonable official time to prepare a timely response to those charges. Within ten (10) days of the receipt of the employee's response to the charges of loss of objectivity, the NRC will provide the employee with a final determination. The NRC agrees that before issuing a final determination, it will fully consider all of the employee's responses to the charges.</p>
<p class="noindent">Of the negotiability of the proposal, FLRA explained, 47 FLRA at 382-86:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, to ensure objectivity, resident inspectors assigned to a nuclear power plant site are automatically relocated after serving at a site for 5 years. However, if the Agency determines, during the course of an inspector's assignment to a site, that there is a question concerning that inspector's objectivity, the inspector may be reassigned to another work site before the end of the 5-year tour. Proposal 5 addresses the Agency's finding that an inspector has lost his or her objectivity and the decision, based on that finding, to reassign the inspector to another work site before the end of a 5-year tour.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, Proposal 5 prescribes the steps that an inspector can take to respond to a management finding that the inspector is no longer sufficiently objective to function appropriately as an inspector at the currently assigned nuclear power plant. As a result of management's finding, the inspector may be reassigned to a different power plant. The purpose of the proposal is to provide the inspector with an opportunity to rebut the alleged loss of objectivity before management makes its final determination and, based thereon, its decision to reassign the inspector. The question is whether the process required by the proposal would directly interfere with management's rights to assign employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute encompasses the assignment of employees to positions, including the initial assignment and reassignments. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 738 and Department of the Army, Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</span>, 33 FLRA 380, 382 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>). The right to assign work to employees under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties and work to be assigned and the particular employees to whom or positions to which it will be assigned. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt</span>, 3 FLRA 769, 775 (1980), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>, 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record, we find that the reassignment referenced in the proposal involves an assignment to a different position rather than just a change of location. We also find that the process required by the proposal would not prevent management from reassigning an inspector to a different position at another nuclear power plant site or from determining the particular duties to be assigned to the inspector at that site. Rather, the proposal does nothing more than provide a mechanism which will allow inspectors an opportunity to defend themselves against an Agency allegation that they have lost their objectivity.... The decision to reassign the inspector--after providing the inspector with notice, with a statement of the reasons supporting a conclusion of loss of objectivity, and with an opportunity to respond to those reasons--would remain with management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that, by requiring it to fully consider all of the inspector's responses, the last sentence of the proposal would directly interfere with management's rights to assign employees and assign work because it would restrict management's ability to reassign resident inspectors and result in relief requiring the Agency to return the inspector to the position from which he or she was reassigned. Proposals requiring only that an agency consider exercising its management rights in a particular manner do not interfere with those rights. <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board Professional Association and General Counsel, National Labor Relations Board</span>, 32 FLRA 557, 563 (1988). Moreover, to the extent that the Agency's argument constitutes a claim that the proposal would permit the substitution of an arbitrator's judgment for that of the Agency in the exercise of management rights, we have consistently held that an agency's "concern that an arbitrator's judgment may be substituted for its own is not a basis for finding [a proposal] nonnegotiable." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 350 (1991). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newark Force Station and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 636 (1987) ("[t]he question of any impermissible arbitral interference with management's rights must be directed to the merits, including remedy, of an arbitration decision").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the proposal simply provides procedures, under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute, in connection with management's decision to reassign employees based on an asserted loss of objectivity. In so finding, we reject the Agency's argument that the procedural steps established by the proposal would delay a reassignment and thereby directly interfere with the Agency's exercise of its management rights. The fact that it would take a period of time to complete the required steps prior to making a final decision on reassigning the employee does not mean that the proposal directly interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1505 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (proposal requiring a 10-day delay in imposition of any suspension of 14 days found to constitute a negotiable procedure). However, even assuming that compliance with the procedures set out in the proposal would result in the delay of a reassignment that would directly interfere with management's rights to assign employees and assign work, we find that the proposal constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether the proposal constitutes an arrangement, the Union explains that the proposal is an arrangement for resident inspectors who are alleged to have lost their objectivity and who, based on that allegation, are reassigned to a position at another work site before the end of a 5-year tour. According to the Union, the proposal provides the inspector with an opportunity to respond to that allegation, which could adversely affect the employee's professional reputation and family life. The Union contends that a reassignment based on a determination of loss of objectivity would cause "enormous" disruption to an inspector and to the inspector's family, who would have to be uprooted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we find, for the reasons that follow, that the proposal constitutes an arrangement, under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, through the evaluation of employee performance. Specifically, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B), management has the right to prescribe criteria governing employees' performance of their duties.... Management also has the right under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) to evaluate employees' performance under the criteria that it has established....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, management's right to prescribe criteria governing employees' performance is not limited to the identification of critical elements and the establishment of performance standards as part of a performance appraisal system under chapter 43 of title 5 of the United States Code<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Finance and Accounting Service</span>, 45 FLRA at 913. It is clear that the criterion of objectivity involved in this case is a criterion governing inspectors' performance of their duties. Consequently, regardless of whether that criterion is a part of the Agency's performance <span id="page_905"></span>appraisal system for inspectors, we find that it constitutes an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. We also find that management's evaluation of inspectors' performance under that criterion constitutes an exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, based on the record in this case, that it is reasonably foreseeable that some inspectors who are evaluated as to the objectivity with which they perform the duties of their positions will be found by management to have lost their objectivity. We also find that inspectors who are the subjects of such a finding would be adversely affected by that finding, within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In particular, inspectors who have been unfairly or wrongly accused by management of having lost their objectivity would be adversely affected by that charge. Proposal 5 would mitigate these adverse effects by providing inspectors with the opportunity to rebut management's finding of loss of objectivity before the decision is made to reassign them. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 5 is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the burden imposed by the proposal on management's exercise of its rights, we noted above that the proposal does not preclude management from reassigning an inspector. Management retains the discretion to permanently reassign the inspector after the steps described in the proposal have been followed. Moreover, except for the reasonable time required for an inspector to prepare a response, the time required to complete the process is within management's control. Thus, we find that the proposal contemplates that a minimal delay is all that would be necessary to accomplish the objective of affording inspectors the opportunity to defend themselves against an Agency charge that they have lost their objectivity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the proposal does not preclude the Agency from temporarily assigning other duties to the inspector alleged to have lost objectivity.&#x2003;Moreover, the proposal would not preclude the Agency from temporarily reassigning that inspector's duties during the time required to complete the prescribed procedures, if the Agency has concerns about the inspector's work performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the benefit to inspectors of being afforded an opportunity to respond to an Agency decision to reassign them to a position at another work site based on an alleged loss of objectivity, and of the requirement that the Agency fully consider that response before making a final determination, outweighs the burden imposed on the Agency's right to assign employees and assign work by the delay resulting from the requirements of the proposal. Additionally, we note that the proposal could benefit the Agency by saving it from expenses resulting from unnecessary or unwarranted reassignments. We find, therefore, that the proposal would not excessively interfere with management's rights to assign employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 5 is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that employees are reassigned, a union may negotiate to have the employees returned to the original worksite, as long as the challenged proposal preserves management's discretion to determine the qualifications of and need for returning employees. In <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n of Teachers and DODDS, Mediterranean Region</span>, 49 FLRA 73, 73-74 (1994), the proposal was:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Current employees who were involuntarily reassigned from the Lajes Air Base Schools at the end of School Year 1991-92 shall be given priority to return to Lajes if: (1) a vacancy occurs; (2) the Employer decides to fill the vacancy; (3) the Employer decides to fill the vacancy through a reassignment of an employee from outside of Lajes; and (4) those employees wishing to return to Lajes are fully qualified and have a current performance rating of at least fully successful.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">OFT</span> proposal was negotiable, 49 FLRA at 75-76:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign employees under section 7106(A)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to determine the qualifications and skills needed to perform the work of a position and the right to determine whether individual employees meet those qualifications. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 987 and U.S. Department of Air Force, Warner Robins Air Force Logistics Center, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia</span>, 35 FLRA 265, 269 (1990). The provision here, by its plain wording, applies only after the Agency has determined to fill a vacant position at Lajes by reassignment of an employee from outside Lajes and only after the Agency has determined the qualifications required for the reassignment and whether an employee requesting reassignment meets those qualifications. As such, we conclude that the provision does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3295 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Thrift Supervision</span>, 47 FLRA 884, 907 (1993) (Member Talkin dissenting as to other matters) <span class="Italic">petition for review filed as to other matters</span>, No. 93-1488 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 10, 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so concluding, we find that the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Fort Knox Dependent Schools</span> [26 FLRA 934 (1987)], <span class="Italic">Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service</span> [39 FLRA 27 (1991)], and <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> [46 FLRA 696 (1992)], is misplaced. In those cases, the disputed proposals limited management's discretion to determine the position to which an employee would be reassigned. In contrast, the provision here preserves the Agency's discretion to determine the position which will be filled by a reassignment, the qualifications necessary for reassignment, and whether individual employees meet those qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's assertion that the provision interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The right to assign work includes the right to determine to whom or to what position duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union, Local 200-B and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Syracuse, New York</span>, 44 FLRA 821, 834 (1992). Nothing in the provision prevents the Agency from determining the duties to be assigned to any position, or to whom those duties will be assigned. Consequently, we conclude that the provision does not interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the provision does not interfere with management's rights, we need not address the Agency's arguments that the provision is not an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Accordingly, as no other basis on which to find the provision nonnegotiable has been asserted, we conclude that the provision is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent">If management is stripped of the ability to assess qualifications of returning employees, FLRA may find nonnegotiable a provision for guaranteed return rights of reassigned employees, as in <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers Ass'n, Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DOD, Stateside Dependents Sch., Laurel Bay</span>, 49 FLRA 679, 681 (1994), Proposal 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the event the reason for the involuntary reassignment no longer exists, the employee will have the option of return to the school location/grade/subject area from which they were involuntary [sic] transferred at the start of the following school years.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Laurel</span> <span class="Italic">Bay</span> proposal was nonnegotiable, 49 FLRA at 683-85:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that require management to fill vacancies from a single source directly interfere with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union explains that Proposal 2 applies only where the employees' former positions are vacant and management has decided to fill them. However, by requiring management to give employees who were involuntarily reassigned the option of returning to those vacant positions, Proposal 2 limits management in the exercise of its right to select from any appropriate source. Accordingly, Proposal 2 directly interferes with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that Proposal 2 directly interferes with management's right to select from any appropriate source, we next consider whether the proposal is nevertheless negotiable as an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.... First, we determine whether the proposal constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. To do this, we ascertain whether the proposal in question seeks to address, compensate for, or prevent adverse effects on employees produced by the exercise of management's rights.... Second, if we conclude that the proposal is an arrangement, we then determine whether the proposal is appropriate, or inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. We make this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to ascertain whether the benefit to employees flowing from the proposal outweighs the proposals burden on the exercise of the management right or rights involved. <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In weighing those needs in this case, we note that the Union contends that the burden on management of reassigning employees to positions that they would normally hold when there are vacancies that management intends to fill is "slight when compared to the dramatic imposition of the reassignment." Further, the Union notes that the proposal "leaves flexible at what point the reassignment is to occur[.]" However, the Agency asserts that some employees "may no longer be qualified for the positions from which they were reassigned" and that Proposal 2 excessively interferes with management's right to determine the qualifications needed for the vacant positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal applies to all bargaining unit employees who were involuntarily reassigned when: (1) the reasons for their involuntary reassignments no longer exist; (2) their former positions are vacant; and (3) management has decided to fill the positions. Although the proposal benefits such employees by giving them the option of returning to their former school location, grade, and/or subject area, it provides this benefit without addressing the employees' current qualifications for the positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_906"></span>In its statement of position, the Agency interprets Proposal 2 as, among other things, preventing the Agency from determining whether to fill vacant positions and, if it chooses to fill the positions, from determining whether employees remained qualified for those positions. In its response brief, the Union explains that Proposal 2 preserves the Agency's discretion in filling vacant positions but does not dispute the Agency's interpretation that the proposal would prevent management from determining employees' qualifications for vacant positions.... In the absence of any indication by the Union or from the plain wording of the proposal that the proposal preserves the Agency's right to determine employees' qualifications, we find that the proposal would preclude management from determining whether any of the employees are "no longer qualified for the positions from which they were reassigned." Such a burden on management's right, under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute, to determine whether the employees are currently qualified for the positions from which they were reassigned is substantial because the proposal applies to all involuntary reassignments of bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, we find that the burden placed on management's right to select from any appropriate source outweighs the benefit conferred on employees by the proposal. Accordingly, we conclude that Proposal 2 excessively interferes with management's right to select from any appropriate source under section 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute and, therefore, is nonnegotiable....</p>
