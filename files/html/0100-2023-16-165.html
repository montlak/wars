<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-165"><span class="space">e.</span> Performance Appraisal; Balancing Workload</h5>
<p class="noindent">As a general proposition, protected activity cannot be considered or referenced, even nonjudgmentally, in a performance appraisal. Decisions suggest, however, that management may insist that some accommodation be made between its need for the employee to perform position responsibilities and the employee's need to fulfill responsibilities as a union official.</p>
<p class="noindent">Statements implying that union activity is a negative factor in a performance rating restrain employees and constitute unlawful interference. A statement that a performance improvement period will be used to correct performance deficiencies that a supervisor attributes to union activities is also coercive. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 22 FLRA 91, 109-10 (1986) (ALJ Decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Northampton and NAGE Local R1-107</span>, 51 FLRA 1520, 1520 (1996) (ULP for supervisor to issue performance counseling to employee because he became union steward and engaged in protected activity); <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 46 FLRA 1126 (1993) (sustaining arbitrator's decision to require monetary award to union official considered to be spending too much time on union activities).</p>
<p class="noindent">A comment on a performance appraisal that an employee, a union steward, spent too much time on union business, constituted interference. The suggestion of any relation between the employee's protected activity and his or her employment status violates the Statute. <span class="Italic">US Air Force Lowry AFB and AFGE Local 1974</span>, 16 FLRA 952, 958 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Interference occurred when a supervisor told a union steward that he could not expect better treatment from management if he continued to engage in union activities and that he would be getting better evaluations were he not constantly questioning management's actions. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Training Ctr., Kansas City and Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org.</span>, 16 FLRA 379, 386-87 (1984) (ALJ Decision). If anything, the appraisal should credit the employee for time spent on union activities, if time is a factor to be considered in the application of performance standards. A productivity review and goal that does not take into account known union activities may be considered coercive and discriminatory if the timing of the appraisal coincides with protected activities. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 22 FLRA 91, 111-12 (1986) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">A statement in an appraisal that an in-depth critique could not be offered of the employee's performance because she "is fully involved with Union problems at all levels and is frequently away from her duty station" was not interference, <span class="Italic">EEOC, Jackson Area Office and Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216, AFGE, Local 3599</span>, 34 FLRA 928, 929 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]o <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule applies in cases where management is alleged to have made unlawful statements....&#8197;[T]he test to be applied...is whether, under the circumstances, the statements could reasonably tend to interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in exercising their rights under the Statute....&#8197;Insofar as <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, [<span class="Italic">Baltimore</span>, 22 FLRA 91 (1986)] and prior Authority decisions could be construed as establishing a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that prohibits any reference to protected activity in a performance appraisal, those decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find nothing in the disputed language itself which could reasonably be interpreted to discourage an employee from engaging in protected activities. In addition, there is no evidence that other employees were even aware of the appraisal so that the appraisal could have arguably tended to interfere with...their statutory rights.</p>
<p class="noindent">It is unlawful to lower an appraisal because of an individual's union activities. The remedy is withdrawal of the appraisal and reappraisal. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 14 FLRA 311, 330-31 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Factors suggesting union animus include the timing of events and a sudden drop in the evaluated performance of an employee by a new supervisor who appears to harbor the animus. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 14 FLRA 499, 530 (1984) (ALJ Decision). An example of analysis of motivation for a lowered appraisal appears in <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group, March AFB and AFGE Interdepartmental Local 3854</span>, 27 FLRA 279, 283-85 (1987), involving an employee with an exemplary performance record whose very high appraisals dropped when she made clear her intent to involve the union and grieve reassignment to another supervisor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of Kleinfieldt's prior excellent record, her admittedly continued high level of performance, Damiano's remarks about the filing of the grievance and calling in the Union and the timing shortly thereafter of the lowered evaluation, we are persuaded that the evaluation was a result of Kleinfieldt's calling upon the Union and filing the grievance. Further, on its face, the lowered evaluation is inconsistent with the asserted performance-related reasons. This is not a matter of substituting our judgment for that of the rating official, as suggested by the Judge. Kleinfieldt was given a "5" or "Fully Satisfactory" rating in every one of nine categories after receiving a "9" or "Outstanding" 5 months before, and for a time during which the rating official, as found by the Judge, said her performance remained the same as at the end of the prior rating period. The only reason given for the lower ratings was that Kleinfieldt's failure to cooperate and accept supervision warranted only a "Fully Successful" rating. There has been no showing that any of the factors, let alone all of them, could have been adversely affected by the cited failure to cooperate [work effort; adaptability to work; problem solving; working relationships; communication; work productivity; self-sufficiency; skill in work, work management]. In fact, performance of at least some of the factors apparently could not have been affected by the problems alleged to be the cause of a lowered rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">There should be sufficient proof of motivation to demonstrate reprisal. <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group</span> was cited in <span class="Italic">IRS, Indianapolis Dist. and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 32 FLRA 335, 338-39 (1988), involving exceptions to an arbitration award, said of an arbitrator's analysis of an allegedly retaliatory performance appraisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with the Union's contention that the Arbitrator imposed an improper burden on the Union to demonstrate that the Agency violated the Statute. The Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group</span> is misplaced. In that case, the unfair labor practice complaint alleged that the respondent improperly appraised an employee's performance because she sought assistance from the union and filed a grievance. The Authority held that in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination in violation of section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute, it must be shown that the affected employee engaged in protected activity and that the activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with the employee's conditions of employment. 27 FLRA at 282. The Authority ruled that not only was it proper in that case to draw an inference that the protected activity was a motivating factor in the respondent's treatment of the employee, but that the employee's protected activity was the sole motivating factor in giving her a lowered performance rating and the alleged reasons for the lowered appraisal were pretextual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator concluded that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the supervisor discriminated against the grievant because of her union activity. The Arbitrator stated that while the Union could use circumstantial evidence, insufficient evidence had been admitted to prove a violation in this case. He further stated that "[a] series of speculations and assumptions would have to be engaged in by this Arbitrator for me to conclude that incident caused a violation of 5 USC 7116(a)(1) and (2)." The Arbitrator declined to make inferences based on the record and found that the Agency had not improperly discriminated against the grievant in violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to show a violation of the Statute constitutes a finding by him that the grievant's protected activity was not a motivating factor in the supervisor's appraisal of the grievant and, therefore, that the Union had <span id="Page_1393"></span>not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the Statute. Contrary to the Union's assertion, the Arbitrator did not require the Union to demonstrate an express management statement linking the protected activity and Agency action detrimental to an employee. Rather, as the Arbitrator properly acknowledged, the Union could use circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that a statutory violation occurred. We believe that the Arbitrator simply found that the evidence before him was insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Accordingly, we decline to find the award deficient on the basis asserted by the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent">Not every link between appraisals and union activities is unlawful. No coercion was inherent in a memo from management, responding to a union official's request for information about an appraisal, that showed how union activities interfered to a degree with training requirements of the job. The employee did not view the memo as threatening, a factor FLRA considered in its assessment of the effect of management's memo. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1485</span>, 33 FLRA 626, 638-39 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force and AFGE Local 1942</span>, 60 FLRA 620, 623 (2005) (performance appraisal properly took into account letter of counseling issued to union president for what was considered poor interaction with coworkers).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRBU</span>, 61 FLRA 197, 199-200 (2005), involving review of an arbitration award, was particular as to the analysis required by an arbitrator who considers the allegation that union activities negatively influenced performance ratings; the requisite causal connection between union activities and a diminution of a rating must be shown to support a remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator framed the issue as a contract (not a statutory) violation: whether the Agency discriminated against the grievants in their annual performance appraisals because of union activity "in violation of the [parties'] agreement." Nevertheless, the Authority has applied statutory standards in assessing the application of contract provisions that mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 59 FLRA 767, 769-70 (2004). Here, the contract provision relied on by the Arbitrator, Article 4, &#x00A7; 5(a), is identical to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute in all relevant aspects. Moreover, the Union specifically argued before the Arbitrator that the Agency conducted the employees' performance appraisals in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute, the Agency makes statutory (not contractual) objections to the award, and neither party contends that the Arbitrator applied contractual standards to the dispute. Accordingly, we review the award under statutory principles applicable in unfair labor practice (ULP) cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in a union by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. When a grievance under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute involves an alleged ULP, the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 57 FLRA 464, 465 (2001). In a grievance alleging a ULP by an agency, the Union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged ULP by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> As in other arbitration cases, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, the Authority addressed the analytical framework to be applied in cases alleging a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. Under this framework, the party alleging discrimination must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee. If the required <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is made, then an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that: (1) there was a legitimate justification for its action; and (2) the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118. In cases, such as this one, where a judge or arbitrator does not explicitly apply the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>framework in making his or her determinations, the Authority examines whether the determinations are consistent with the requirements of <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fed.</span> <span class="Italic">Emergency Mgmt. Agency</span>, 52 FLRA 486, 491-92 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Ogden Serv. Ctr., Ogden, Utah</span>, 42 FLRA 1034, 1053 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Ogden Serv. Ctr.</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Employee A</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first element of the Union's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the parties do not dispute that employee A was engaged in protected activity during the appraisal period in dispute. Regarding the second element, the Arbitrator found that employee A's appraisal reflected a "drastic, unprecedented reduction in her ratings" and that a significant part of it "appears to reflect a determination by the Agency to make a strong statement against her." According to the Arbitrator, the only apparent reason for lowered ratings was reprisal for her union activities. In addition, upon examining employee A's rating for the element "oral and written communication," the Arbitrator stated that "at least some of the friction and ill will" stemmed from her protected union activities. The Arbitrator's conclusions are consistent with a finding that employee A's protected activity was a motivating factor in the Agency's appraisal of employee A. <span class="Italic">See Ogden Serv. Ctr., </span>42 FLRA at 1053. We note, in this regard, that contrary to the Agency's claim, nothing in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> requires a finding of union animus to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, 60th Air Mobility Wing, Travis Air Force Base, Cal.</span>, 59 FLRA 632, 636-37, 643 (2004) (<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case established without union animus).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's affirmative defense requires establishment of both elements set out in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Baltimore, Md.,</span> 53 FLRA 1751, 1755 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Warner Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 52 FLRA 602, 605 (1996) (in finding that agency established affirmative defense, Authority examined both elements set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>). As applied here, the Arbitrator's findings indicate that the Agency had legitimate justification--the first element of the affirmative defense--for lowering some if not all of employee A's element ratings. For example, the Arbitrator found that employee A did not timely complete her work assignments in some instances, that she resisted directives from management officials, and that her performance regarding oral and written communication justified a lower rating. As for the second element of the affirmative defense, however, the Arbitrator did not find that, and the record does not indicate whether, the Agency would have taken the same action in the absence of employee A's protected activity. We note, in this regard, that two of the three contested element ratings were two-level drops from the previous appraisal. Even assuming that the Agency had legitimate justification for lowering the ratings, the record does not indicate whether the Agency would have given employee A the same (two level lower) ratings in the absence of her union activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As it is not possible to determine from the record whether the Agency established an affirmative defense with respect to employee A, we are unable to determine whether the award is contrary to law. Where an award fails to contain the factual findings necessary to enable the Authority to assess the arbitrator's legal conclusions, and the findings cannot be derived from the record, the case will be remanded to the parties for submission to the arbitrator so that the requisite findings can be made. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>53 FLRA at 1712. Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for submission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for findings necessary to determine whether the Agency would have taken the same action against employee A even in the absence of her protected activity.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Employee B</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with employee A, the parties do not dispute that employee B was engaged in protected activity during the appraisal period in dispute. With regard to the second element of the Union's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, however, nothing in the record indicates whether employee B's union activity was a motivating factor in the Agency's treatment of her. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated that "[i]t is as though the deck was stacked against [employee B] on [the] element [of effectiveness and efficiency], because if all the circumstances are taken into account her work is clearly commendable." However, the record does not indicate whether this "stacked deck" referred to employee B's union activity. As there is no basis in the record for determining whether the protected activity of employee B was a motivating factor in the Agency's treatment of employee B, the record does not permit the Authority to determine whether a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was made with respect to employee B.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even assuming that the Arbitrator properly found that the Union had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the record does not permit the Authority to determine whether the Agency established an affirmative defense with respect to employee B. With respect to the first element of the Agency's affirmative defense, the Arbitrator's finding that employee B had some timeliness problems in completing her work indicates that the Agency had a legitimate reason for giving employee B a lowered rating for the element "effectiveness and efficiency." However, with regard to the second element, the Arbitrator did not find that, and the record does not indicate whether, the Agency would have taken the same action against employee B in the absence of her protected activity. In particular, the record does not disclose whether the Agency would have given employee B a level three rating in the absence of her union activity. As there is no basis in the record for determining whether the Agency would have taken the same action against employee B in the absence of her union activity, the record does not permit the Authority to determine whether the Agency established an affirmative defense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As it is not possible to determine from the record whether, with respect to employee B, the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case or the Agency established an affirmative defense, we are unable to determine whether the award with respect to employee B is contrary to law. In these circumstances, we remand the award to the parties for submission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for findings necessary to determine whether employee B's protected activity was a motivating factor in the Agency's treatment of her and, if it was, whether the Agency would have taken the same action regarding employee B even in the absence of her protected activity. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA<span class="Italic"> </span>at 1712.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1394"></span>Although there was some evidence of supervisory animus toward a union steward, the record contained sufficient evidence of the employee's poor performance that a poor supervisory appraisal was warranted and would have been issued had there been no animosity. <span class="Italic">438th Air Base Group, McGuire AFB and AFGE Local 1778</span>, 11 FLRA 303, 315 (1983) (ALJ Decision).

<p class="noindent">Management may seek to convey to an employee the need to balance workload against union responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 20 FLRA 761 (1985) (discussed below as to policing by management of official time), addressed how management may secure agreement about responsibilities that result in conflicting demands on an employee's time. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 35 FLRA 891, 898 (1990), considered the situation of a union official who was told that his appraisal was lowered because of increased time spent on union work. FLRA referred to the concept of "accommodation"--a matter that will be developed below concerning the problem of monitoring of official time:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Edwards' statements as to why he gave Cantu-Villarreal a lower annual performance rating did not constitute an attempt at accommodation. At the time Edwards made his statements, he had already implemented his decision as to [his] performance appraisal rating. Unlike in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>, Edwards' statements were made after the implementation of the decision as to the performance appraisal. Before issuance of the...appraisal, Edwards and management expressed to Cantu-Villarreal their concerns about the conflict between his use of official time and his work performance but nothing in the record indicates that during that time Edwards or management suggested to Cantu-Villarreal how to avoid a lower performance rating or other ways to "accommodate" those concerns.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A] unit employee reasonably could have interpreted the statement to mean that Edwards would penalize a Union official who spent a significant amount of time engaged in protected activities by lowering his performance appraisal rating...</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the appraisal itself, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592</span>, 35 FLRA at 900-01, followed the analysis outlined in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot and Int'l Bhd. of Police Officers, Local 358</span>, 35 FLRA 113 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Edwards' statements as to why he gave Cantu-Villarreal a lower performance appraisal rating drew a direct connection between protected activity and...obtaining a higher performance appraisal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[A] legitimate basis for the lower appraisal is not established in the record....&#8197;In finding that there was a legitimate basis for the lower appraisal, the Judge cites only Edwards' testimony that Cantu-Villarreal gave him a really good job in 1985, but in 1986 the extra effort was not there. The record, however, reveals no corroborating testimony from other witnesses or documentary evidence to support Edwards' justification for the lower appraisal. In the absence of such evidence, we find that the Respondent has failed to rebut the clear showing that the perceived differences between Cantu-Villarreal's performance in the 1986-87 appraisal year and the preceding period all stemmed from his absences for Union activity and not from a deterioration of his work when he was on the job.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The standard for determining whether management's statement or conduct violates section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute is an objective one.

<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel "acknowledges it did not specifically allege 'accommodation' as an issue in the amended complaint," but argues that accommodation is a defense that must be raised by a respondent....&#8197;We agree that the issue of accommodation is a defense that may be raised by a respondent. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Center</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force</span> (where the Authority evaluated respondents' defenses that statements made to employees were an accommodation between management's rights and employees' protected activity and, therefore, did not violate section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute)....&#8197;[E]ven though the General Counsel did not allege a violation based on the Respondent's failure to accommodate Roach's protected rights and management's rights, we find that the Judge was not prevented from considering the Respondent's defense in this regard....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an agency to encourage or discourage membership in a union by discrimination in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. The Authority has stated that the framework in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> will be applied to cases of alleged discrimination under section 7116(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 117. In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, we reaffirmed that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n all cases of alleged discrimination,...the General Counsel must establish that: (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The parties do not dispute that Roach engaged in protected activity and that management was aware of that activity.&#x2003;Therefore, it must be determined whether the Respondent's decision to lower Roach's performance rating for 1989-90 was motivated by her protected activity. In this regard, it is necessary to determine whether in August or September of 1990, Henry actually told Roach that she was "using an awful lot of official time and [that] it was affecting [her] timeliness on getting procurement out[,]" and, if so, under what circumstances....&#8197;If Henry made such a statement, then it would be necessary to determine whether the statement, its surrounding circumstances, and any other evidence offered by the General Counsel establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>....</p>
<p class="noindent">Following its return after remand, FLRA concluded in <span class="Italic">Frenchburg</span> that the agency violated of 5 USC 7116(a)(1) and (2) by lowering an appraisal of a union official because of agency concerns about the time spent by that official on union activities. The decision analyzed the burden of proving the linkage between the appraisal and union activities and the accommodative response expected of an employer that sees a conflict between work requirements and union commitments, <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Frenchburg Job Corps and NFFE Local 466</span>, 49 FLRA 1020, 1031-35 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties do not dispute that in 1988-89 Roach engaged in protected activity by spending approximately 28 percent of her time on official time, as opposed to 2 percent in 1988-89, that management was aware of that activity, and that Caswell found no problems with Roach's performance at her mid-year review in March of 1990. The parties also do not dispute that, although Roach performed basically the same amount of work during both appraisal periods, Roach received a lower performance rating from Henry in 1989-90 than she did from Lesch in 1988-89....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first issue is whether the Respondent's decision to lower Roach's performance rating for 1989-90 was motivated by her protected activity. The Judge found that in the course of refusing to approve several official time requests, Henry made a statement to Roach "linking official time usage to a lack of timeliness in getting her work done" and that there was "no evidence that such words were contemporaneously accompanied by offers of assistance."...&#8197;According to Roach, the statement was made in August or September of 1990....&#8197;Henry's statement equated Roach's use of official time with the timeliness of her work. Such a statement, combined with evidence that Henry subsequently lowered Roach's rating based in part on timeliness, demonstrates that Henry directly connected Roach's use of official time, her performance, and ultimately her rating<span class="Italic">. See Ogden Air Logistics Center</span>, 35 FLRA at 900 (the General Counsel established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span> by showing that management's statements to the employee "drew a direct connection between protected activity and [the employees] chances of obtaining a higher performance appraisal").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the timing of Henry's statement, near the end of the appraisal period, demonstrates that the statement was made around the same time that the Judge found Henry to have "pencilled in" notes of what turned out to be Roach's performance appraisal and rating for 1989-90....&#8197;The Authority has previously held that the timing of management actions may be significant in determining whether an employee's protected activity was a motivating factor, within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, in the agency's decision to take action against the employee. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, El Paso, Texas</span>, 39 FLRA 1542, 1552 (1991). In this case, <span id="Page_1395"></span>where the employee performed basically the same amount of work in much less time, where no performance problems were found in the first 6 months of the appraisal period, and where the performance rating was determined by the supervisor around the same time as that supervisor made a statement connecting the employee's protected activity with her performance, we find that the timing is significant in demonstrating that the employee's protected activity was a motivating factor in the Respondent's decision to lower her performance rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, we find that the General Counsel has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next consider the Respondent's affirmative defenses to determine whether the Respondent established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had a legitimate justification for its action and would have taken the same action in the absence of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 123. The Respondent argued before the Judge that Roach's performance rating was lower in 1989-90 based on timeliness and quality....&#8197;The record shows that management expressed concerns about the timeliness of Roach's work in June and early July of 1990 and that after Caswell had prioritized Roach's current requisitions, Roach met required deadlines. The record also shows that Caswell, who approved the rating, testified that Roach was not rated in conformity with critical element 1, which involves purchasing and requisitions. We find that the Respondent has not shown what performance standards or elements were applied to evaluate the timeliness of Roach's performance on requisitions and whether, pursuant to those standards, Roach was expected to perform 40 hours of work per week while at the same time spending over one-quarter of her time on approved official time. In these circumstances, and in view of our determination above that the Respondent's asserted concern with the timeliness of Roach's work was linked to Roach's protected activity, we find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that its concern with the timeliness of Roach's work is a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for lowering Roach's performance rating. Moreover, in the absence of further explanation by the Respondent, we are unable to determine that the Respondent's asserted concern with the quality of Roach's work in 1989-90 was a legitimate justification. Finally, as the Respondent has failed to argue, much less establish, that it would have given Roach the same rating absent consideration of her protected activity, we find that the Respondent has not rebutted the General Counsel's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(2) of the Statute by lowering Roach's performance rating for the 1989-90 performance period.</p>

By linking Roach's protected activity with Henry's perception of her performance, Henry effectively discouraged Roach from engaging in further protected activity. That is, in these circumstances, it would be reasonable for an employee in Roach's position to infer from Henry's statement that her performance would be perceived as deficient so long as she spent time on protected activity....&#8197;Moreover, the statement was made well after performance problems allegedly occurred and did not include an offer of assistance or suggestion on how to avoid performance problems in the future, other than to refrain from engaging in protected activity. We find that the statement was not made in an attempt to resolve a conflict between management's right to manage efficiently and the employee's right to engage in protected activity but was an after-the-fact criticism of Roach's protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By criticizing Roach's use of protected activity without attempting to resolve a perceived conflict between the employee's right to engage in such activity and management's right to manage efficiently, we find that, in the circumstances of this case, the Respondent, through Henry's statement to Roach, interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the exercise of their right to engage in protected activity. Accordingly, consistent with <span class="Italic">Ogden Air</span> <span class="Italic">Logistics Center</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
