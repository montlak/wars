<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-182"><span class="space">b.</span> Policing Official Time</h5>
<p class="noindent">A change by management in the manner that a union official secures official time or approval for official time is a unilateral change in working conditions in violation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5). <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 4 FLRA 686, 699 (1980) (ALJ Decision). The agency violates the Statute by unilaterally changing the practice concerning the time when union representatives may meet with employees. <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles and AFGE Local 2866</span>, 25 FLRA 685, 688 (1987). An unlawful change in employment conditions may be shown by a change in the agency's willingness to provide travel orders to a union official to attend labor relations training sessions he previously attended on travel status. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 12 FLRA 43, 45 (1983). But management does not commit a ULP by reaffirming a policy of requiring advance approval for release time of union officials if there is no change in working conditions and if the reaffirmation of established policy is intended to ensure uniformity of enforcement among all the employees of respondent. <span class="Italic">DHEW, Region V, Chicago and Local 3400, AFGE</span>, 4 FLRA 736, 737 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent">Efforts by management to police official time used by union stewards or other officials, at the direction of OPM, are not inherently coercive nor do they constitute interference if unaccompanied by improper acts or speech. <span class="Italic">Defense Gen. Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 2047</span>, 15 FLRA 932, 939 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Inquiries concerning a union official's sick leave used are protected if consistent with the manager's responsibility of insuring that employees abide by leave regulations. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 22 FLRA 91, 110 (1986) (ALJ Decision). An agency does not interfere with union business by policing a contract allowing reasonable official time through monitoring of phone calls to a union steward and requests to callers for the nature of their calls. There is no interference when the contract requires a certain procedure for calls on official time to union officials, if the agency insists the procedure be followed rather than allowing a more direct procedure selected by a union official that avoids the contract procedure. <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 14 FLRA 311, 329 (1984) (ALJ Decision). An agency commits a ULP by restricting official time for EEO representation activities because the representative is a union official with other official time commitments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Riley and AFGE Local 2324</span>, 26 FLRA 222, 242 (1987) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">The agency may impose reasonable restrictions on use of official time so that it can properly control the workforce. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 23 FLRA 594, 603 (1986) (ALJ Decision). Official time is to be used for labor-management activities, i.e., with respect to representation for investigation and attempted informal resolution of employee grievances, participation in formal grievance resolution procedures, attendance or preparation for meetings of joint labor-management committees, and discussion of problems in contract administration between union and management officials. A supervisor may restrict use of official time by challenging the use of time previously granted and precluding its use if it is reasonably suspected as not being used for labor-management activities. If the grievant believes that she was improperly denied official time, her recourse is to obey the order and then file a grievance. A contrary arbitration award was set aside. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Admin. and AFGE Council 236, Local 2928</span>, 24 FLRA 245, 247-48 (1986). No ULP is committed if management charges a union negotiator with AWOL for lateness at negotiation sessions set for duty hours when the official would otherwise be on official time. <span class="Italic">DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr. and AFGE Local 3407</span>, 18 FLRA 532, 549 (1985) (ALJ Decision). If the union arrives with too many negotiators and refuses to designate a proper number, management does not violate the Statute by putting all of them on AWOL until the union designates the individuals who will serve on official time. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Space Div., Los Angeles and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 6 FLRA 439, 451 (1981) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency improperly disciplined a union steward when he declined to deviate from the contract procedure for requesting official time and failed to follow a procedure specially developed for that steward, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2266 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 69 FLRA 525, 527-31 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine the award's consistency with &#x00A7; 7102, we begin with the statutory text. Section 7102 provides, in pertinent part, that "[e]ach employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right."[36] The Authority's case law establishes that &#x00A7; 7102 protects a variety of activities, including requesting official time to perform representational activities.[37] In this regard, although the dissent implies that the Authority's case law is unsettled about whether requesting official time is protected activity, the Authority clearly held that &#x00A7; 7102 protects such requests almost twenty-five years ago.[39] And, in this case, there is no dispute that the grievant's request for official time was a protected activity,[40] notwithstanding the dissent's attempts to manufacture a dispute on this point. Nevertheless, despite the Arbitrator's recognition that &#x00A7; 7102 generally protects the act of requesting official time, she found that the grievant's conduct during his request--specifically, not submitting the request in accordance with the new procedure--was "outside the bound[aries] of protected activity." <span class="Italic">That</span> is the issue before us.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that an agency may discipline a union representative for conduct occurring during protected activity if the representative engages in flagrant misconduct or otherwise exceeds the boundaries of protected activity.[43] In <span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Mapping Agency, Aerospace Center, St. Louis, Missouri</span> (<span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span>),[44] the Authority recognized four factors "to be considered in striking the balance" between activity that the Statute protects, and misconduct that "imping[es] upon the [agency's] right to maintain order."[45] As relevant here, those factors include: (1) the place and subject matter of the conduct; (2) whether the conduct was impulsive or designed; (3) whether the conduct was in any way provoked by the employer; and (4) the nature of the intemperate conduct.[46] Additionally, the Authority determines whether conduct exceeds the boundaries of protected activity on a case-by-case basis that considers the totality of the circumstances.[47] As part of the totality of circumstances, the Authority has considered whether an employee's conduct is "similar to" conduct that the Authority previously found protected.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In reviewing the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant's conduct lost &#x00A7; 7102's protection, we will first evaluate the <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factors--as well as explain why we disagree with the dissent's contrary evaluation--and then we will discuss a relevant case involving protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the first <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor concerns the "place" and "subject matter" of the conduct.[49] Regarding "place," the Authority has held that conduct that disrupts a work unit jeopardizes "the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite."[50] Here, the grievant's misdirected request did not cause any worksite disruption. Regarding "subject matter," because the grievant's request aimed to secure official time for representational activities, the "subject matter of the [request] was within the scope of the [grievant's] legitimate [representational] concerns."[51] And as the request concerned "not only the grievant's right to official time under the parties' agreement[,] but also his pursuit of that right,"[52] the subject matter implicated both contractual and statutory rights.[53] Accordingly, we find that the first <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor supports a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the second <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers whether the grievant's conduct was impulsive or designed.[54] The Arbitrator's findings do not indicate that the grievant acted impulsively in directing his request to the wrong supervisor. Accordingly, the second factor does not weigh in favor of finding the grievant's conduct within the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Def. Mapping</span>, 17 FLRA at 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the third <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers whether the conduct at issue was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct.[55] Because the Arbitrator's findings do not address provocation in connection with the instructions charge, "this factor does not offer significant assistance in determining whether the grievant's conduct...exceeded the boundaries of protected activity."[56]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[55]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[56]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 2595</span>, 68 FLRA at 296 (finding provocation factor "not particularly helpful" where arbitral findings did not address provocation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the fourth <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers the nature of the conduct by examining: (1) whether the conduct was brief or prolonged; (2) the tone of communication; and (3) whether there was any physical conduct or threat of violence.[57] Based on the Arbitrator's findings, the grievant resisted the new procedure for more than a brief interval.[58] Regarding the "tone" of the communication,[59] there is no dispute that the request conveyed only mundane factual information, such as names, position titles, times, a duty location, and a section of the parties' agreement. Further, the placement of the request in the wrong supervisor's mailbox did not affect the tone of the request. And, as for whether there was any physical conduct or threat of violence,[61] the misdirected form here was far removed from those types of behavior. Thus, on balance, we find that the fourth factor supports finding that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the dissent's narrative of this case, we are not reviewing a disciplinary charge that alleges that the grievant repeatedly misdirected official-time requests--a different situation that could have affected our view of the "nature of the...conduct" at issue.[62] As all but the dissent recognize, the Arbitrator did not sustain the disrespectful-conduct charge. Indeed, the only charge that the Arbitrator sustained--and, given the Agency's decision not to file exceptions to the award, the only charge before us now--expressly relied on a single official-time request. And the <span class="Italic">only</span> basis on which the Agency alleged that this single request constituted misconduct--despite the request's apparent satisfaction of all expressly stated conditions in the parties' agreement--was the grievant's failure to fulfill his supervisors' unilaterally imposed, extra-contractual demands.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Def. Mapping</span>, 17 FLRA at 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent attempts to obscure these basic facts by: (1) comparing this case to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) that concerned discipline for "<span class="Italic">many incidents</span> of...insubordinate conduct";[68] (2) characterizing the interactions at issue in the disrespectful-conduct charge--which the Arbitrator set aside completely, and which the Agency did not seek to revive through exceptions--as "figur[ing] prominently" in this dispute; (3) setting out a confounding argument about distinctions between employee misconduct and disciplinary charges; (4) alleging that <span class="Italic">the grievant</span> repeatedly violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement, without citing any arbitral findings to that effect; and (5) attempting to place the instructions charge against the grievant into an alleged pattern of misconduct by others. Moreover, the dissent proposes that we decide this case using a legal standard that the dissent attributes to the D.C. Circuit--in which a single act of misconduct would, "by definition," exceed the boundaries of protected activity--but that standard is of the dissent's own making, and not from any D.C. Circuit decision.[74] For those reasons, we reject the dissent's characterization of the conduct at issue in the Union's exceptions, as well as the dissent's novel standard for evaluating such conduct.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, as part of the totality of circumstances relevant here, we note that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</span> (<span class="Italic">Tinker</span>),[75] is "similar to" this case in many ways.[76] In <span class="Italic">Tinker</span>, the grievant attempted "to personally serve copies of unfair[&#8197;]labor[&#8197;]practice charges...on...supervisors who were named in the charges."[77] The grievant's "actions took place in a work area" on a military base, after his workday ended.[78] Several supervisors questioned the grievant about what he was doing, and told him to leave the area where he was attempting to serve the charges.[79] The grievant "refused to leave the work area,...was detained[,] and security police were called to remove the grievant."[80] The grievant then refused to follow a security-police officer's instruction to leave the work area, at which point a second officer arrived to assist the first officer.[81] Only then did "the grievant agree[&#8197;] to depart."[82] At all times, the grievant explained that he was acting on behalf of his union.[83]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As discipline for the conduct described above, the agency in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span> issued a letter of reprimand, which the union in that case grieved.[84] The arbitrator who resolved that grievance upheld the discipline, based on his finding that the grievant should have "compl[ied] with a clear order and...[g]rieve[d] later."[85] In reviewing a contrary-to-law exception to that arbitrator's award, the Authority accepted that the grievant's failure to follow directions "constituted insubordination," but "reject[ed] the [a]gency's assertion that...insubordination...cannot be protected under the Statute."[86] Instead, because the grievant's conduct was not so "outrageous and insubordinate" as to exceed the boundaries of protected activity, the Authority set aside the letter of reprimand as inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute.[87]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[84]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 386.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator's findings here are very similar to those discussed in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span>, the Agency neither attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">Tinker</span>, nor questions its continued validity. In addition, we observe that the conduct in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span> was arguably more outrageous than the conduct here, because the grievant in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span> not only disobeyed the instructions of multiple agency supervisors, but also repeatedly defied instructions from two security-police officers. Thus, we see no principled basis to reach a different conclusion in our &#x00A7; 7102 analysis here than the one that the Authority reached in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, two of the <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factors--the first factor ("place" and "subject matter") and the fourth factor ("nature of the conduct")--weigh in favor of a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity. Only one of the factors--the second, which considers whether conduct was "impulsive or designed"--does not weigh in favor of that conclusion. And the third factor, regarding provocation, does not offer significant assistance here. Further, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Tinker</span> firmly bolsters a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, based on the totality of the circumstances relevant here, we find that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in determining that the Agency could discipline the grievant for failing to submit his request in accordance with the new procedure. Rather, we find that the grievant's conduct retained its protected status under &#x00A7; 7102 because it did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity. And, we find that the Agency could not lawfully discipline the grievant for this protected activity. Accordingly, we set aside the letter of reprimand, and we modify the award to sustain the grievance with regard to the instructions charge.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency did not interfere with an employee's protected rights by charging him AWOL when he left the base for an FLRA interview. The contract and past practice required him to either remain on base when using official time or provide to management some notice of his activities or whereabouts. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 23 FLRA 594, 603 (1986) (ALJ <span id="Page_1420"></span>Decision). In two adverse action cases, arbitrators and a reviewing court found lawful discipline against union officials who refused to obey orders directing them to perform agency work and instead performed union representational duties under the erroneous impression that they had a contract right to official time.
