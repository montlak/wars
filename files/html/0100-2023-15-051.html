<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-52"><span class="space">a.</span> Short, Infrequent AWOL</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fifteen minutes absence without leave, coupled with insubordination, resulted in mitigation of removal to a 60-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 429, 431 (1984). But 15 minutes of AWOL, coupled with other offenses (destruction and unauthorized use of government property) and a past disciplinary record for an employee with good performance in a sensitive position, resulted in removal in <span class="Italic">Delgado v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 685, 690-01 (1988)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Price v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 33, 37 (1990) (sustaining a 15-day suspension for a brief but unauthorized visit to a credit union; a past disciplinary record weighed heavily in the Board's decision: "[W]hile this transaction may appear to be <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, it is not so when considered in light of the appellant's past disciplinary record."). Ordinarily, however, short absence is not sufficient to warrant dismissal. A 30-minute production delay, caused when the employee took a lunch break that he had been told to postpone, resulted in reduction of removal to a 30-day suspension. Appellant had 10 years of service, a good work record, and was apologetic about his conduct. He had an excellent chance for rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Williams v. GPO</span>, 7 MSPR 183, 185-86, 7 MSPB 98 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lovenduski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 612, 167-68 (1994) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension when the removal was based on 30 minutes of AWOL coupled with a charge of misuse of government property; the employee had some prior counseling on attendance matters and some prior discipline on other matters); <span class="Italic">Coppola v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 307, 318-19 (1991) (mitigating demotion to reprimand for the charge of taking an extended lunch hour for personal reasons). A removal for "continuing unsatisfactory service" was mitigated to a seven-day suspension when the current charge was an employee's visit to a Dunkin Donuts during work hours. Employees had not been warned that they would be subject to discipline if they went across the street to that establishment rather than visited the closer vending machine. There was no evidence that the incident resulted in any loss of productivity. Although the employee had a past disciplinary record and relatively short service with the agency, removal was too harsh. <span class="Italic">Gunn v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 576, 579 (1982). A 10- to 20-minute absence by an employee who went to another location to receive information about a relative's illness, when there was no supervisor nearby from whom the employee could obtain leave, was a <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> violation warranting no penalty, even with a poor past leave record. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 355, 357, 6 MSPB 303 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was mitigated to a 10-day suspension for an appellant who was half an hour tardy and did not provide the documentation requested by the agency to prove that his car had broken down. The removal was unreasonable: the agency did not point to any specific problem created by appellant's tardiness; the appellant worked through his supper time to accomplish the task he was to have done during the first hour of his shift; the appellant had 140 hours of annual leave to his credit; and although there was a record of past discipline, there was also some evidence of disparate treatment. <span class="Italic">Batchelor v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 336, 338 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Clardy v. VA</span>, 13 MSPR 598, 600-01 (1982) (mitigating removal to suspension of a radiologic technician for several hours of AWOL; evidence of a disparity of penalties in the working unit; the agency did not present evidence of any readily apparent adverse impact on agency functions); <span class="Italic">McNeill v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 516, 518, 7 MSPB 369 (1981) (mitigating to a 10-day suspension the removal imposed for two-and-a-half hours of AWOL; the employee had eight years of service and a prior three-day suspension); <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 205, 206, 6 MSPB 180 (1981) (setting aside a removal for one hour of AWOL when a past disciplinary record was discounted). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 527, 528 (1982) (sustaining removal for three hours of AWOL when appellant had a history of past suspensions for AWOL and the record showed appellant's absences were frequent and repetitive).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2495"></span>Absence without leave of 15 minutes on one occasion and six hours on another, by an employee whose performance was otherwise satisfactory and who had an unblemished prior record, warranted reversal of a removal. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 508, 510, 4 MSPB 28 (1980). A series of unscheduled breaks by another employee required mitigation of a demotion to a 30-day suspension because of the employee's otherwise sustained good performance. <span class="Italic">Lybrand v. DHHS</span>, 37 MSPR 51, 54 (1988). Removal for a few hours of AWOL, even with a poor leave or disciplinary record, can be too harsh a penalty. <span class="Italic">Greene v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 502, 504, 5 MSPB 499 (1981). Even with a relatively poor record of attendance, two hours of AWOL did not justify a removal: there was some evidence of rehabilitation, satisfactory job performance, and a clean recent record. <span class="Italic">Walton v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 178, 182, 7 MSPB 94 (1981) (20-day suspension was substituted). After the Board sustained only two-and-a-half hours of 30 hours of AWOL charged, removal was excessive; for the two and a half hours of AWOL, a 30-day suspension was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 146, 148-49 (1984) (mitigating factors included appellant's distressing domestic situation, a sleeping disorder, and transportation problems; past discipline relied on by the agency included actions improperly based on approved leave). In an appeal involving multiple charges, the only charge sustained was that the appellant was AWOL for a little more than two hours. The agency table of penalties should have been followed; considering his six years of service, a suspension was reduced from 28 to five days. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. USDA</span>, 8 MSPR 33, 35, 7 MSPB 531 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A removal was mitigated to a 10-day suspension of an employee who worked for an agency for eight years, who had some previous minor disciplinary actions for insubordination and AWOL, and who was AWOL for a few hours during the course of a day. The brief absence did not have a significant impact on the appellant's work as a housekeeping aid or on the mission of the agency, nor did the offense seriously impact appellant's continued ability to perform those duties. <span class="Italic">McNeill v. VA</span>, 7 MSPR 516, 518, 7 MSPB 369 (1981). An absence of 12 1/2 hours for an employee with 13 years of service did not justify removal; the penalty was mitigated to a 45-day suspension. No special harm was caused to the agency by the absence. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 24 MSPR 537, 543 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rooffener v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 1, 4-5 (1982) (removal for about 12 hours of AWOL was reduced to a 60-day suspension; although some prior discipline had occurred, there was no evidence that the absence had a seriously detrimental effect on agency operations, nor did the employee have a disruptive or detrimental effect on fellow employees; a past incident of AWOL was not a deliberate violation of the agency rules); <span class="Italic">Swentek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 77, 81 (1981) (despite past discipline for AWOL, removal was mitigated to a 10-day suspension for one day of AWOL when the appellant was genuinely injured, the agency was quickly apprised of doctor's instructions, those instructions were not explicit, and no specific harm resulted from the absence). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Milner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 163, 166-67 (1990) (sustaining removal of a 12-year employee for five days of AWOL in a month, the appellant's fourth leave-related offense, with a prior record of progressive discipline and notice that further AWOL would not be tolerated); <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 26, 28-29 (1987) (sustaining removal for two days of AWOL and improper use of time to make telephone calls; the appellant was previously counseled and other acts of misconduct involving conduct and attendance expectations suggested low rehabilitative potential). One day of AWOL during the air traffic controllers' strike supported 60 days of suspension for an employee with 23 years of prior service and one unrelated prior disciplinary problem. The Board justified the departure from the suggestion in the agency table of penalties, calling for a three-day suspension or less for a first AWOL offense, because of the need for the appellant's services during the national operational emergency caused by the work stoppage. <span class="Italic">Ackley v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 17 MSPR 243, 247-48 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Clarke v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 20 MSPR 422, 424-25 (1984) (same result as <span class="Italic">Ackley</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An eight-and-a-half hour absence without leave justified removal, given a prior disciplinary record for absences. <span class="Italic">Gamble v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 649, 653 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hartigan v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 613, 619-20 (1989) (eight hours of AWOL was not <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span>; the case was remanded for a review of the penalty). Removal was sustained for six hours of AWOL when four prior disciplinary infractions existed. <span class="Italic">Edmond v. VA</span>, 21 MSPR 633, 637 (1984). Removal for one day of AWOL was acceptable in <span class="Italic">Moten v. USPS</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 796 (1982), for an employee previously disciplined and warned about the same conduct. The Board sustained removal of a postal supervisor for a day of AWOL when the charge was coupled with another charge that the employee falsely claimed sick leave. <span class="Italic">Beverly v. USPS</span>, 907 F.2d 136 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Seventeen hours of AWOL supported removal of an employee with a past disciplinary record for AWOL. <span class="Italic">Cantu v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 24 MSPR 601, 604-05 (1984). A current sustained charge of AWOL of less than a day, coupled with a past disciplinary record based on two or three days of AWOL, was sufficient to warrant removal. <span class="Italic">Banks v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 6, 7 n.* (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stivers v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3028) (affirmed removal for two days of AWOL). <span class="Italic">Spates v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 133-34 (1984), sustained removal for three days of AWOL. The appellant, a janitor, offered no persuasive reason or explanation to excuse his absence. The agency imposed past discipline for the same offense. Removal of a vocational rehabilitation specialist for four days of AWOL, and failing to request leave to cover those days, was sustained in <span class="Italic">Hertzog v. VA</span>, 14 MSPR 255, 258 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. DOD</span>, 14 MSPR 278, 280 (1982) (a packer was removed for about six hours of AWOL; a prior record of progressive discipline for AWOL suggested a lack of rehabilitative potential).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning removal for short periods of AWOL, the court commented in <span class="Italic">Haynie v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we hold that, though the three sustained AWOLs were each quite short, the agency and the Board did not abuse their discretion in imposing the penalty of removal. Petitioner had a considerable prior history of discipline--five such actions over a two-year period, four of which were for AWOL. He had also been warned that his attendance deficiencies could lead to removal. That recent background is enough to show that removal could be the sanction for the three short AWOLs here....&#8197;We have no doubt, too, that such continuous AWOLs have a nexus to the efficiency of the service, and that removal of an employee who follows those practices will promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For decisions involving somewhat longer periods of AWOL, refer to <span class="Italic">Lawton v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 153, 158 (1992) (no mitigation for AWOL of about three days when coupled with a past disciplinary record in the relatively recent past), and <span class="Italic">Maddux v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 644, 646 (1995) (no mitigation for AWOL of approximately two weeks).</p>
