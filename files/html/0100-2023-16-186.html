<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-186"><span class="space">H.</span> REPRESENTATION DURING INVESTIGATIONS; <span class="Italic">WEINGARTEN</span> RIGHTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Statute grants to the union the right to participate as representative during investigations and during "formal" discussions. We initially consider representation during investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7114(a)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;Any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(i)&#x2003;the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(ii)&#x2003;the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Statute generally tracks the representational rights first established by the NLRB and confirmed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251, 256-64 (1975). The public policy supporting representational rights during investigations of unit members by employers was explained in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the right inheres in &#x00A7; 7's guarantee of the right of employees to act in concert for mutual aid and protection....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the right arises only in situations where the employee requests representation. In other words, the employee may forgo his guaranteed right and, if he prefers, participate in an interview unaccompanied by his union representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the employee's right to request representation as a condition of participation in an interview is limited to situations where the employee reasonably believes the investigation will result in disciplinary action....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, exercise of the right may not interfere with legitimate employer prerogatives. The employer has no obligation to justify his refusal to allow union representation, and despite refusal, the employer is free to carry on his inquiry without interviewing the employee, and thus leave to the employee the choice between having an interview unaccompanied by his representative, or having no interview and forgoing any benefits that might be derived from one....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fifth, the employer has no duty to bargain with any union representative who may be permitted to attend the investigatory interview....&#8197;"The representative is present to assist the employee, and may attempt to clarify the facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of them. The employer, however, is free to insist that he is only interested, at that time, in hearing the employee's own account of the matter under investigation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Requiring a lone employee to attend an investigatory interview which he reasonably believes may result in the imposition of discipline <span id="Page_1422"></span>perpetuates the inequality the Act was designed to eliminate, and bars recourse to the safeguards the Act provided "to redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management." <span class="Italic">American Ship Building Co. v. NLRB</span>, 380 U.S. 300, 316, 85 S. Ct. 955, 966, 13 L. Ed.2d 855 (1965). Viewed in this light, the Board's recognition that &#x00A7; 7 guarantees an employee's right to the presence of a union representative at an investigatory interview in which the risk of discipline reasonably inheres is within the protective ambit of the section "read in the light of the mischief to be corrected and the end to be attained." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc.</span>, 322 U.S. 111, 124, 64 S. Ct. 851, 857, 88 L. Ed. 1170 (1944).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board's construction also gives recognition to the right when it is most useful to both employee and employer. A single employee confronted by an employer investigating whether certain conduct deserves discipline may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors. A knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by eliciting favorable facts, and save the employer production time by getting to the bottom of the incident occasioning the interview. Certainly his presence need not transform the interview into an adversary contest. Respondent suggests nonetheless that union representation at this stage is unnecessary because a decision as to employee culpability or disciplinary action can be corrected after the decision to impose discipline has become final. In other words, respondent would defer representation until the filing of a formal grievance challenging the employer's determination of guilt after the employee has been discharged or otherwise disciplined. At that point, however, it becomes increasingly difficult for the employee to vindicate himself, and the value of representation is correspondingly diminished. The employer may then be more concerned with justifying his actions than re-examining them.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights were summarized in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BLM and AFGE Local 1911</span>, 68 FLRA 178, 181 (2015), reviewing and sustaining an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right is triggered when four elements are present: (1) the meeting at issue must be an examination of an employee by a representative of the agency; (2) the examination must be in connection with an investigation; (3) the employee must reasonably believe that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (4) the employee must request representation.[28] The determination of whether an employee's belief that disciplinary action may result is reasonable rests on objective factors.[29]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, Fed Corr. Complex Coleman, Florida</span>, 63 FLRA 351, 354 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, S.C</span>., 32 FLRA 222, 229 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">By implication, if statutory representational rights are not established under 5 USC 7114 (<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights), an agency need not notify the union of an investigation and the agency need not permit union representation unless the investigation otherwise qualifies as a formal discussion or unless the collective bargaining agreement provides rights not established by statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">In analysis that would be modified, but in a holding relating to investigations that remains the law, FLRA explained that an investigation, does not, in itself, require the agency to permit the presence of a union representative, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 42, 43-47 (1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question here presented is whether a union has the right under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute to be represented at a meeting, such as those here at issue, between a management representative and an employee or employees when management is conducting an investigation by examining such employees for the purpose of gathering facts. In order for the Authority to address this question, it is necessary to analyze the constitution of section 7114(a)(2) of the Statute and its legislative history.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(A) and section 7114(a)(2)(B) provide respectively that "(a)n exclusive representative...shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--(A) any formal discussion...<span class="Italic">or</span> (B) any examination...in connection with an investigation...." The use of the conjunction "or" to separate these sections indicates a Congressional intent that the right to union representation at formal discussions in section 7114(a)(2)(A) be separate from the right to union representation at an examination contained in section 7114(a)(2)(B). That these rights were also intended to apply to different situations is evident from the legislative history of section 7114. Thus, the rights in section 7114(a)(2)(A) were intended to apply to union representation at certain formal discussions between representatives of an agency and unit employees concerning grievances, personnel policies or practices or other general conditions of employment. However, such rights were not intended to apply to meetings which are "highly personal, informal meetings."[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority notes particularly the following statement of Representative Clay of Missouri concerning the addition of the word "formal" to that portion of the "Udall substitute" which was ultimately enacted as section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[T]he word "formal" was inserted before "discussions" in order to make clear the intention that this subsection does not require that an exclusive representative be present during highly personal, informal meetings such as counseling sessions....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">124 Cong. Rec. 29187, 29188 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The legislative history of section 7114(a)(2)(B), on the other hand, indicates that Congress intended that when an employee is subjected to an examination in connection with an investigation and that employee has a reasonable belief that disciplinary action may result, there is a right to union representation, upon request.[6] Thus, unlike the situations covered by section 7114(a)(2)(A) which may give rise to the right of union representation, i.e., formal discussions between management and an employee or employees concerning grievances, personnel policies, practices or other general conditions of employment,[7] the situation giving rise to the right of union representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B) is the existence of an examination of a unit employee in connection with an investigation. However, such a right will only attach where the employee who is being examined reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action and the employee requests representation.[8] The requirement that the employee request representation further highlights the distinction between the right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A) and section 7114(a)(2)(B), respectively. That is, the right to union representation under section 7114(a)(2)(A) is not contingent upon an employee's request for such representation at formal discussions although it is a requirement for representation at examinations in connection with investigations under section 7114(a)(2)(B). Had Congress not intended to separate the rights in these sections, then a union could be present at an examination in connection with an investigation (which otherwise might fall within the meaning of "formal discussion" in section 7114(a)(2)(A)) without being so requested. Clearly, by the very language of section 7114(a)(2)(B), this is not what Congress intended.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 40 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 824 (1979), wherein the conferees indicated that such a right is to be accorded labor organizations "at any examination of an employee by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if the employee reasonable believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Bureau of Government Financial Operations, supra</span> n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Base, Norfolk, Virginia,</span> 14 FLRA 731 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question here presented is whether a union has the right to be represented at a meeting with an employee or employees when management is examining such employee(s) in connection with an investigation intended to gather facts (here for the purpose of rendering a decision in a grievance). Such an examination is to be contrasted with formal discussions which may be held with grievants during the processing of a grievance under the steps of a negotiated grievance procedure. Clearly such discussions, where they are formal in nature, fall within the ambit of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Here, the meetings between the management representative and the employees were not formal discussions under the steps of the grievance procedure, but instead were examinations of unit employees in connection with an investigation by management for the purpose of making a decision on the grievance. The Authority therefore finds that any union entitlement to be represented at such a meeting is attendant upon the requirements of section 7114(a)(2)(B). This conclusion is compelled by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">inclusio unius est exclusio alterius</span>.[11] Where the literal language of section 7114(a)(2)(B) clearly applies to situations involving examinations of employees in connection with investigations, a determination as to whether a union has the right to be represented at the type of examination now before the Authority must perforce be decided under section 7114(a)(2)(B) and consideration under section 7114(a)(2)(B) is inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Literally, "The inclusion of one is the exclusion of another." <span class="Italic">See Black's Law Dictionary</span> 906 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). For purposes here, where a provision of the Statute includes certain matters within its coverage, then by implication, all other matters are not so covered</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the employees were examined in connection with an investigation. This being so, there occurred no "formal discussion" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). It follows that the Respondent's failure to afford the Union an opportunity to be represented thereat was not inconsistent with section 7114(a)(2)(A). While the complaint herein did not allege a violation of the Statute based on a failure to comply with the provisions of section 7114(a)(2)(B), the Authority notes there is no <span id="Page_1423"></span>evidence that the employees who were examined reasonably believed that the examination might result in disciplinary action against them or that they had requested representation. In the absence of any such showing, the Authority concludes that the failure to afford the Union an opportunity to be represented at the examinations could not constitute a violation of the Statute.[12]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C., and Internal Revenue Service, Hartford District Office,</span> 4 FLRA 237 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA,</span> 671 F.2d 560 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority further finds that the examinations of unit employees did not constitute an unlawful bypass of the Union, as alleged. In this connection, the General Counsel has failed to establish that the Respondent attempted to negotiate or deal directly with unit employees concerning their conditions of employment or in any manner sought to undermine the status of the Union as the employees' exclusive representative.[13]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 42 (1985), would be modified by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 29 FLRA 594 (1987), determining that formal discussions included management interviews of individuals in the unit to prepare for an arbitration hearing. The essential principle of <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA</span>--that investigatory interviews do not ordinarily carry the right to union representation unless <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, formal discussion, or contract requirements are implicated--was reiterated in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3428 and EPA Region 1</span>, 66 FLRA 156, 158 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, all of the Union's exceptions challenge the Arbitrator's finding that the employee's complaint was not a "grievance" within the meaning of the CBA or the Statute. However, after making that finding, the Arbitrator expressly found that "there are two additional rationales for concluding that the Union has not met its burden of proving that [the Agency's] failure to notify the Union in this case violated the [CBA] or the [Statute]." It is not disputed that these two additional rationales do not concern the Arbitrator's view of the definition of "grievance." Instead, the Arbitrator's first additional rationale found the circumstances of this case similar to those presented in <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>where the Authority found that there were no unlawful formal discussions when employees were examined in connection with an investigation. <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>18 FLRA at 46. The Arbitrator's second additional rationale was that the Union suffered no harm. Moreover, the Arbitrator reiterated that the award was based on multiple grounds when she summarized that she denied the grievance "[f]or all of the above-stated reasons." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 16.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7114, an investigation or examination triggering the requirement that an agency permit an employee to have a union representative need proceed with no particular formality. Conversations that change into questions concerning an employee's duties or employment readily qualify for examination status. <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1501</span>, 19 FLRA 748, 757 (1985) (ALJ Decision). Managers' requests for explanations of what may be misconduct are examinations, particularly if management considers the discussions to be part of an investigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Metro. Correctional Ctr., New York and AFGE Local 3148</span>, 27 FLRA 874, 878-79 (1987). That the request for information requires the response to be written, e.g., a written reply to a series of written questions, still leaves the inquiry an "examination" invoking, on request, representational rights<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">INS, Border Patrol, Del Rio and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2366</span>, 46 FLRA 363, 371 (1992). Be it titled an interview, investigation, or counseling, whenever the circumstances underlying a meeting make it reasonable to envision a discussion of an employee's conduct that could lead to discipline, the employee is entitled to union representation. The representative is entitled to take an active part in the proceeding. <span class="Italic">FAA, St. Louis Tower, Bridgeton and PATCO Local 352</span>, 6 FLRA 678, 686 (1981) (ALJ Decision). The right to representation does not depend on the agency's characterization of the interview process. Representational rights do not depend on whether the agency informs the employee that he is the subject of an investigation or simply a witness. It is the nature of the investigation and the reasonable belief of the employee that control the statutory right to representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Office of Inspector Gen. and AFGE INS Council, Local 1210</span>, 47 FLRA 1254, 1261 (1993). Refer to the General Counsel's Memorandum of January 26, 1999, <span class="Italic">Guidance on Applying the Requirements of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to Processing Equal Employment Opportunity Complaints and Bargaining over Equal Employment Opportunity Matters</span> for guidance on the right to union representation during EEO investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">"[O]nce an employee makes a valid request for union representation, the burden shifts to the employer to: (1) grant the request, (2) discontinue the interview, or (3) offer the employee the choice between continuing the interview unaccompanied by a union representative or having no interview at all." <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Metro. Correctional Ctr., New York and AFGE Local 3148</span>, 27 FLRA 874, 879 (1987). In an investigatory interview, the prerogatives of management do not include continuation of the interview after a request for union representation is made. Management may grant the request, suspend the interview, or give the employee the choice of having an interview unaccompanied by his representative or having no interview and foregoing any benefits that might be derived from one. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 14 FLRA 82, 97 (1984) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">A meeting with an employee called to convey a management decision already made is not an investigation requiring, if requested, a union representative. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 2750th Air Base Wing HQ, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 9 FLRA 871, 881 (1982) (ALJ Decision). A session called by supervisors to tell an employee not to repeat misconduct, such as threats they attributed to him, was not an examination. No questions were asked of the employee. The session consisted of nothing more than a warning to the employee. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 15 FLRA 360, 361-62 (1984). Left open for consideration upon remand to an arbitrator in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506,</span> 63 FLRA 351 (2009), was whether a fitness for duty examination constitutes an investigation, or a component of investigation, triggering <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights. A subsequent award was set aside when FLRA determined that the arbitrator exceeded his authority on remand by deciding a remedial issue that was not properly before him. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 66 FLRA 300 (2011) (Authority decision not addressing <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> issue).</p>
<p class="noindent">A meeting of a credentials committee to receive the report of an expert witness was not an examination entitling the unit member whose credentials were at issue to representation. The committee extended an invitation to the unit employee to permit him to hear the expert's report and to question the expert, but the committee would have met with or without the unit employee's presence. The committee made only a report and recommendation, it took no action by itself. The employee was not required to attend. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Med. Dept. Activity, Ft. McClellan and AFGE Local 1941</span>, 24 FLRA 487, 491 (1986). The <span class="Italic">Local 1941</span> result was reversed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1941 v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 495, 498-500 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the court deciding that the employee's attendance at the credentials committee meeting, although voluntary, was necessary if he were to continue his employment by defending suggestions that his level of professional performance was substandard. The court noted that in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), although compulsory attendance at a meeting was a factor considered by the Supreme Court as to the right to union representation, the controlling considerations were whether the employee wanted union support and whether he reasonably feared discipline. The right to union representation was not defeated because the employee had the right to have an attorney. The union has an independent, although derivative, right to monitor employer practices. The obligation to permit the presence of a union representative is not satisfied if the employee is offered the opportunity to have an attorney present. <span class="Italic">Lackland AFB Exch. and AFGE Local 2911</span>, 5 FLRA 473, 487 (1981) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">The union's right to designate its representative during an investigatory interview is broad but not absolute. It may be precluded from designating a representative who is the subject of the investigation, at least until after the investigatory interview of the representative is finished. The right to representation at the interview is not limited to a representative who himself is a member of the bargaining unit. The representative may be an attorney employed by the union. <span class="Italic">Fed. Prison Sys., FCI Petersburg and AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 2052</span>, 25 FLRA 210, 228-29, 231 (1987) (ALJ Decision).</p>
