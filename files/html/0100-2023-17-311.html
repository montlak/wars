<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-309"><span class="space">c.</span> Due Process; Notice of Charges; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span></span> Communications</h5>
<p class="noindent">If the issue before the arbitrator is whether an agency provided due process to the grievant in a disciplinary case, FLRA reviews the arbitrator's construction of the law if the governing contract provision parallels statutory and regulatory protections, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, 61 FLRA 4, 6-7 (2005) (<span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 61 FLRA 393 (2005)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute in this case that, as the Union states, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503(b), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.203, and Article 32(D) are "virtually identical" and that these provisions are "relevant and controlling...when it comes to the [g]rievant's statutory, regulatory and contractual pre-decisional due process rights." As such, for purposes of this case, we find that the statutory, regulatory, and contractual provisions must be interpreted consistently. Accordingly, in determining whether the award is contrary to law, we will examine whether the Arbitrator's interpretation and application of Article 32(D) is consistent with the statutory and regulatory provisions.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that the Authority has applied statutory standards in assessing the application of contract provisions that mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, the Statute. <span class="Italic">See ACT, Show-Me Army Chapter</span>, 58 FLRA 154, 155 (2002); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 2010</span>, 55 FLRA 533, 534 (1999); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Corr. Facility, El Reno, Okla.</span>, 51 FLRA 584, 589 n.5 (1995). The Authority has done so where one party asserted, and the other party did not dispute, that the contract provision reiterated the statutory provision. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 2010</span>, 55 FLRA at 534.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority reviews questions of law raised by an arbitrator's award and an exception to it <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making such a determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503, "an employee may be suspended for 14 days or less for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service[.]" [6] The Authority has previously held that employees subject to suspensions of 14 days or less under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 are entitled to pre-decisional proceedings no more formal or extensive than an oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to present his or her side of the story. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA 509, 510-11 (2004); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1151</span>, 54 FLRA 20, 26-27 (1998); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Nat'l Mem'l Cemetery of the Pac.</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1177 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 further provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(b) An employee against whom a suspension for 14 days or less is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(1) an advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(2) a reasonable time to answer orally and in writing and to furnish affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of the answer;</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(3) be represented by an attorney or other representative; and</p>
<p class="noindent-4">(4) a written decision and the specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the Agency provided the grievant with a written notice of the proposed suspension, which informed the grievant that the charge against him resulted from his abuse of sick leave and described the events on July 9. In addition, the Agency provided the grievant with the material relied on by the Agency to propose the charge. The grievant was also afforded an opportunity to, and did, respond to the charges against him. As such, the grievant's due process rights under &#x00A7; 7503 were satisfied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA at 510-11; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1151</span>, 54 FLRA at 26-7; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colo.</span>, 48 FLRA 589, 596-97 (1993). The Authority has previously found that findings with regard to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503(b) apply to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.203 as well. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 45</span>, 52 FLRA 1458, 1465 (1997). Accordingly, as the grievant's due process rights were satisfied under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503, they were satisfied under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.203. Therefore, the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant's due process rights were violated is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the parties agree that the statutory, regulatory, and contractual provisions must be interpreted consistently. Accordingly, as the Agency did not violate the statutory and regulatory provisions, it also did not violate the parties' agreement. Therefore, we conclude that the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency violated Article 32(D) is also deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not address the merits of the grievance.&#x2003;Having determined that the Arbitrator erred in finding that there was not just and <span id="page_2283"></span>sufficient cause for the discipline based on his finding of a due process violation, consistent with Authority precedent, we remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a decision on the merits of the grievance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 987</span>, 57 FLRA 551, 557 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA, Nat'l Memorial Cemetery of Pac. and IAM Hawaii Fed. Lodge 1998</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1174-80 (1992), discussed the constitutional process due to an employee who receives a disciplinary proposal. FLRA sustained the award of an arbitrator over exceptions of the union claiming that the arbitrator had not remedied constitutional defects in the action:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving the Union's claim that the Agency denied the grievant the process that was due him under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, we must determine: (1) whether the 5-day suspension deprived the grievant of a property interest that is protected by the Constitution; and (2) if so, whether the process by which the suspension was imposed was constitutionally adequate. <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 538; <span class="Italic">Board of Regents v. Roth</span>, 408 U.S. 564, 576-78 (1972) (<span class="Italic">Roth</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Court noted in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, "[p]roperty interests are not created by the Constitution, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as...law...." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 538 (quoting <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 577). In <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy</span>, 416 U.S. 134 (1974) (<span class="Italic">Arnett</span>), the Supreme Court held that under law and executive order, nonprobationary, competitive service and preference-eligible, excepted service Federal employees were guaranteed continued employment absent such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and that, consequently, such employees had a legitimate claim of entitlement that constituted a property interest under the Fifth Amendment. In <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Stephen</span>), the Merit Systems Protection Board held that Federal employees have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment and have a constitutional right to due process under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> in actions covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7513.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similar to section 7513, section 7503 provides that nonprobationary, competitive service Federal employees may not be suspended for 14 days or less except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. Because such employees cannot be suspended for 14 days or less absent cause, we find in agreement with the Union that such employees have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment without such suspensions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arnett</span>; <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Gillard v. Norris</span>, 857 F.2d 1095 (6th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">Gillard</span>) (because the employee was a state civil servant who could not be removed or demoted on the basis of a nonmerit factor, the employee had a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment); <span class="Italic">Garraghty v. Jordan</span>, 830 F.2d 1295 (4th Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">Garraghty</span>) (because the employee was a state civil servant who could be removed or suspended only for cause, the employee had a constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment). Likewise, because the grievant had a property interest in his employment, we find in agreement with the Union that the Agency could not deprive him of that interest by suspending him without due process of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[O]nce it is determined that the Due Process Clause applies, 'the question remains what process is due.'" <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 541 (quoting <span class="Italic">Morrissey v. Brewer</span>) 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)). However, the very nature of due process precludes any notion of "inflexible procedures universally applicable" to every situation. <span class="Italic">Cafeteria</span> <span class="Italic">Workers v. McElroy</span>, 367 U.S. 886, 895 (1961).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, a tenured public employee was removed and under applicable state law was entitled to a post-removal administrative hearing to contest the action. The Court determined that before public employees with a property interest in their continued employment can be removed, due process requires, at a minimum, that they be given notice of the charges against them and "some kind of a hearing...." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 542 (quoting <span class="Italic">Roth</span>, 408 U.S. at 569-70). More specifically, the Court held that prior to removal, "the tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court arrived at these requirements by balancing the competing interests of: (1) the employee in retaining employment; (2) the government in the expeditious removal of unsatisfactory employees and the avoidance of administrative burdens; and (3) the risk of erroneous removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542-43. However, the Court advised that "[t]he formality and procedural requisites for the hearing can vary, depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 545 (quoting <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Connecticut</span>, 401 U.S. 371, 378 (1971)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Earlier, in <span class="Italic">Goss</span>, 419 U.S. 565, the Court had addressed the procedural due process requirements when a student is suspended from school. The Court concluded that prior to suspension, due process requires "that the student be given oral or written notice of the charges against him and, if he denies them, an explanation of the evidence the authorities have and an opportunity to present his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Goss</span>, 419 U.S. at 581. The Court advised:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There need be no delay between the time "notice" is given and the time of the hearing. In the great majority of cases the disciplinarian may informally discuss the alleged misconduct with the student minutes after it has occurred. We hold only that, in being given an opportunity to explain his version of the facts at this discussion, the student first be told what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 582. In balancing the competing interests, the Court found that, despite the student's interest in not being unfairly excluded from the educational process, "further formalizing the suspension process and escalating its formality and adversary nature may not only make it too costly as a regular disciplinary tool but also destroy its effectiveness as part of the teaching process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 583.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Courts have used these two cases as benchmarks of constitutional due process in determining what process is due for short-term suspensions. In <span class="Italic">Garraghty</span>, 830 F.2d 1295, and <span class="Italic">Gillard</span>, 857 F.2d 1095, public employees were suspended for 5 days and 3 days, respectively. Under applicable state law, neither employee could be suspended absent cause, but neither employee was entitled to a post-suspension administrative appeal to contest the suspension. Both courts indicated that, constitutionally, a short-term suspension that invoked due process protections would require only predecisional proceedings and would not require post-suspension proceedings. In addition, after weighing the competing interests identified in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> in terms of short-term suspensions, both courts held that the predecisional process due required proceedings no more formal and extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> (oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for employees to present their side of the story) and no less extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Goss</span> (oral or written notice of the charges and then, if the individual denies them, an explanation of the authorities' evidence, and an opportunity for the individual to present his or her side of the story). <span class="Italic">Gillard</span>, 857 F.2d at 1099; <span class="Italic">Garraghty</span>, 830 F.2d at 1300; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Click</span>, 609 F. Supp. 1199, 1206-07 (court indicated that constitutionally a short-term suspension invoking due process protection required only a predecisional hearing, and the court held that the hearing is not required to be formal with an opportunity to secure counsel, to confront and cross-examine witnesses supporting the charge, or to call witnesses to support the employee's version of the incident).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining what process is constitutionally due nonprobationary, competitive service Federal employees suspended for 14 days or less, we are persuaded by the reasoning and conclusions of the courts in <span class="Italic">Gillard</span>, <span class="Italic">Garraghty</span>, and <span class="Italic">Click</span>. We find that, constitutionally, such employees are not due post-suspension proceedings and are due predecisional proceedings no more formal or extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and no less extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Goss</span>. Viewing this case in terms of these requirements, we conclude that the process provided the grievant during the proceedings before the Agency satisfied the requirements of <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and, consequently, was constitutionally sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n arguing that the process provided the grievant during the proceedings before the Agency was constitutionally inadequate, the Union contests whether the Agency adequately explained its evidence. Specifically, the Union claims that because the Agency refused to disclose the identity of the informant during the predecisional stage, the Agency failed to adequately explain its evidence, and the predecisional process was, therefore, constitutionally deficient. We disagree. It is clear that although the predecisional process is "necessary," it "need not be elaborate." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 545. The proposed suspension explicitly informed the grievant of the rule that he had allegedly violated and the informant's allegation against him, even though the informant's identity was not disclosed. In our view, this adequately explained and notified the grievant of the evidence on which the suspension was based. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schleck v. Ramsey County</span>, 939 F.2d 638, 642 (8th Cir. 1991) (constitutional due process did not require the public employer to disclose all of the details of the disciplinary charges, such as the names of the accusers as demanded by the employees); <span class="Italic">Poole v. Stephens</span>, 688 F. Supp. 149, 154 (D.N.J. 1988) (revelation of the identity of an informant is not constitutionally required at the predecisional stage).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In claiming that the disclosure of the identity of the informant was constitutionally mandated, the Union has misconceived the purpose of the predecisional process. As Justice White noted in <span class="Italic">Arnett</span>, "the pretermination hearing is not held for the purpose of making...an ultimate determination....&#8197;The function of the pretermination hearing is, and no more is required by due process, to make a probable-cause determination as to whether the charges brought against the employee are or are not true." 416 U.S. at 200 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Justice White restated this purpose for the Court in <span class="Italic">Loudermill:</span> "[T]he pretermination hearing need not definitively resolve <span id="page_2284"></span>the propriety of the discharge. It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." 470 U.S. at 545-46. We find that the explanation of the evidence provided the grievant satisfied the purposes of the predecisional process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the essence of the Union's claim in this case is that the employee has the right to scrutinize the Agency's case prior to suspension. We find such a claim is without merit and would transform the predecisional process into an evidentiary hearing that is simply not required. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pedersen v. Ramsey County</span>, 697 F. Supp. 1071, 1078 (D. Minn. 1988) (refusal to disclose name of an informant did not render predecisional process constitutionally deficient; employee has no right to scrutinize the employer's case prior to discipline). Indeed, what the Union would have us do here, in a case where the Arbitrator found that the grievant had admitted the alleged misconduct, is to turn the predecisional process into a mini-trial--a position that was specifically rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, on remand, based on its reading of what the Supreme Court had held. <span class="Italic">Loudermill v. Cleveland Board of Education</span>, 844 F.2d 304, 310-11 (6th Cir. 1988) (on remand).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we view the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant admitted the alleged misconduct during the investigation as a factor that further supports our determination that the process provided the grievant was not constitutionally deficient. <span class="Italic">See Boals v. Gray</span>, 775 F.2d 686, 690 (6th Cir. 1985) (process by which the employee was suspended met constitutional standards, in part, because the employee did not deny the charges during the predecisional stage of the disciplinary action). We also find that the Arbitrator's recognition that the identity of the informant was not disclosed by the Agency because of the informant's fear of the grievant constitutes an additional factor that supports our determination. <span class="Italic">See Los v. Warden</span>, 771 F. Supp. 266, 270 (C.D. Ill. 1991) (need to protect others from a violent individual is a legitimate consideration in determining what predeprivation procedures are constitutionally due).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the cases relied on by the Union are inapposite.&#x2003;All the cases cited for the proposition that names of witnesses must be disclosed involved removals of public employees, rather than short-term suspensions, and involved the process required for post-removal proceedings. Simply stated, we hold that the disclosure of the identity of the informant was not constitutionally compelled and that, therefore, the Union provides no basis for finding the award deficient. As recognized by the court in <span class="Italic">Garraghty</span> in weighing the competing interests with respect to short-term suspensions, "[r]ealities of the work place...require that authority be respected and that discipline be swift." 830 F.2d at 1302.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Lodge 1998 </span>was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr.</span>, 67 FLRA 372, 374 (2014), involving a short suspension challenged for lack of due process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering exceptions alleging denials of due process, the Authority has distinguished between an agency's pre-decisional actions in the disciplinary process and an arbitrator's conduct during a post-suspension arbitration proceeding.[29] Regarding pre-decisional actions, the Authority has held that an award is not contrary to an employee's due-process rights unless it deprives the employee of notice of the agency's charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, or an opportunity to reply.[30] Regarding post-suspension actions, the Authority has held that federal employees who are suspended for fourteen days or less do not have particular constitutionally required post-suspension due-process protections.[31] That is, there are no constitutionally required due-process protections that arbitrators must observe in conducting those proceedings.[32] Consequently, the Authority has denied due-process exceptions that challenge the way an arbitrator conducts a post-suspension arbitration proceeding.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[33]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Local 1770</span>, 67 FLRA at 65 (denying exception that raised similar due-process argument).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Union's contention that the Arbitrator denied the grievant due process, we note initially that the Union's claim that the Arbitrator upheld a charge not advanced by the Agency is inaccurate. The Agency alleged, and the Arbitrator found, that the grievant violated the policy. But even if the Union's claim were accurate, applying the post-suspension due-process principles set forth above, there are no constitutionally required due-process protections the Arbitrator must observe in conducting the arbitration proceeding. Thus, the contention that the conduct of the arbitration proceeding denied the grievant due process fails.[34] For these reasons, we deny the Union's contrary-to-law exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, we addressed what process is due under the U.S. Constitution when a Federal employee is suspended for 14 days or less. We held that because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 provides that nonprobationary, competitive service employees cannot be suspended for 14 days or less except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service, these employees, such as the grievant in this case, have a constitutionally protected property interest in their employment without such suspensions. However, we explained that the question remained of what process was due.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognized that in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>), the Court determined that before public employees can be removed, due process requires, at a minimum, that they be given notice of the charges against them and "some kind of a hearing...." 470 U.S. at 542.

In <span class="Italic">Goss</span>, the Court concluded that prior to suspension from school, due process requires that the student be given notice of the charges and, if the student denies them, an explanation of the evidence and an opportunity to respond to the charges. In determining what process is due for short-term suspensions, we were persuaded by the courts that have used these two cases as benchmarks of constitutional due process. Accordingly, we held that, as a constitutional matter, nonprobationary, competitive service Federal employees are not due post-suspension proceedings and that they are due predecisional proceedings no more formal or extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and no less extensive than those required by <span class="Italic">Goss</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Viewing the Union's exception in terms of these requirements, we find that the process provided the grievant during the proceedings before the agency satisfied the requirements of <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and, consequently, was constitutionally sufficient. Prior to the decision to suspend the grievant for 5 days, the grievant was provided with written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the Agency's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. In our view, the Union's exception fails to establish otherwise....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1497</span> added, 48 FLRA at 597 n.*:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving the Union's claim that the award is deficient because the Arbitrator upheld discipline when the grievant had been deprived of due process under the Constitution, we note that recently in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Division of Liquidation, Orlando Consolidated Field Office, Orlando, Florida</span>, 48 FLRA 462, 465 (1993) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>), we stated that we are prohibited from disposing of a case on constitutional rather than statutory grounds. We note that in that case, the Union was essentially challenging the constitutionality of the Civil Service Reform Act, and it is clear that the Authority is not authorized to adjudicate the constitutionality of its enabling legislation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 986 F.2d 537, 540 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Thus, <span class="Italic">FDIC</span> should not be read to limit the Authority's power to resolve exceptions under section 7122(a) of the Statute, which contend that an arbitration award is deficient because it is contrary to the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 FLRA 1458, 1464-65 (1997), elaborated on the due process protections required in brief suspensions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Hawaii Federal Lodge 1998</span>, 45 FLRA 1164 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Hawaii Federal Lodge</span>), which involved a 5-day suspension, the Authority addressed, among other things, an employee's constitutional right to due process under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503(b). The Authority found that it was well established that employees, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, have a right to constitutional due process in actions covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. The Authority concluded, for the reasons stated therein, that employees subject to actions covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 have such a right also.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also stated, however, that once it is determined that there <span id="page_2285"></span>is a constitutional right, the question remains what process is due. As relevant here, the Authority found that Federal employees suspended for 14 days or less are not entitled to post-suspension proceedings.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Authority also found that such employees are due predecisional proceedings no more formal or extensive than those required in <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v.

In making its finding in <span class="Italic">Hawaii</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Lodge</span>, the Authority relied on the reasons and conclusions of the courts in <span class="Italic">Gillard v.

Board of Police Commissioners</span>, 609 F. Supp. 1199 (W.D. Mo. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, as the grievant's suspension was an action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503, a post-suspension proceeding was not constitutionally required under <span class="Italic">Hawaii Federal Lodge.</span> Consequently, the Union's challenge to the Arbitrator's denial of its request to raise a defense in the hearing cannot be held to violate the grievant's right to constitutional due process because there is no constitutional requirement for any post-suspension proceeding at all, let alone for the procedures that an arbitrator must follow in the hearing. Accordingly, the award is not contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503. Moreover, inasmuch as section 752.203 simply sets forth specific procedures regarding 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503(b), we find that our conclusion with regard to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503--that the Arbitrator's denial of the Union's request does not violate the grievant's constitutional due process--applies as well to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.203. Accordingly, the award is not contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.203.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases relied on by the Union to support its argument that the grievant had a right to offer the disputed defense at the arbitration hearing are distinguishable.&#x2003;The process required by the Constitution in actions involving suspensions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 is not addressed in any of these cases, none of which concern such suspension proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor, BLS</span>, 67 FLRA 387, 389-90 (2014), also noted the limited due process protections for short suspensions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering exceptions alleging denials of due process, the Authority has distinguished the constitutionally required protections that apply to an agency's pre-decisional actions in the disciplinary process from the protections that apply to an arbitrator's conduct during a post-suspension arbitration proceeding. While recognizing that constitutional protections exist for the interests the Union cites, such as the grievant's property interest in his government employment, the Authority has held that such protections only apply in a pre-decisional context. In contrast, the Authority has held that federal employees who are suspended for fourteen days or less do not have a constitutional right to particular post-suspension due-process protections that arbitrators must observe in conducting arbitration proceedings.[45] Consistent with these principles, we reject the Union's arguments that the Arbitrator violated the grievant's constitutional-due-process rights.</p>

<p class="noindent">Arbitrators' awards will be sustained upon reasonable construction of the charges fairly noticed against a grievant, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2028 and VAMC, Pittsburgh</span>, 54 FLRA 1467, 1467, 1471-73 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator denied a grievance, determining that there was just and sufficient cause for the Agency's 3-day suspension of the grievant based on the unauthorized removal of Government property. However, the Arbitrator determined there was not sufficient cause for the total discipline imposed, which encompassed a demotion and change in shift schedule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the Arbitrator sustained the discipline on the basis that the grievant was responsible for the loss of coffee because he did not properly secure and protect the food item does not render the charges against the grievant deficient under section 7503(b)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) and the Authority have upheld decisions of the Board's presiding officials and arbitrators, respectively, who sustained agency actions on grounds other than those precisely stated by the agencies in their notices to affected employees. In such cases, the MSPB and the Authority have examined whether the charges set forth in the notices encompassed the charges addressed by the presiding officials and arbitrators and whether the affected employees were sufficiently on notice to defend against the charges. For example, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 239 (1982), the Board upheld its presiding official's finding that an employee had properly been disciplined for failing to perform supervisory responsibilities even though the employee had been charged with causing damage to Government property and endangering the lives of personnel. According to the Board, "[w]hile the agency may have phrased the specification differently, the [employee] knew he was basically being charged with negligence in the performance of his supervisory duties." 11 MSPR at 240. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Denver, Colorado and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497</span>, 48 FLRA 589 (1993), the Authority upheld an arbitration award in which the arbitrator sustained a grievant's discipline for fighting on duty. Although the arbitrator took into account the grievant's aggressive actions after the conclusion of the fight, which was the sole subject of the notice, the Authority found that the grievant "was clearly notified that the [a]gency proposed to suspend him for fighting on duty and inflicting bodily harm on another." 48 FLRA at 596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievant was clearly on notice that foodstuffs under his control were removed by an employee outside the Nutrition and Food Service and, as a result of this loss, he was facing a possible suspension. The notice of proposed discipline provided to the grievant indicated, among other things, that he was facing disciplinary action for removal of "a bag of...coffee under [his] control," and specified the date, time and other circumstances surrounding the removal. The Union acknowledges that a charge of complicity "requires the association or participation in...the wrongful act on the part of the grievant." The Arbitrator's factual finding, to which we defer, that the grievant had not properly secured and protected foodstuffs fully supports the Arbitrator's conclusion sustaining the suspension since it establishes the grievant's association with or participation in the removal of the coffee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, as relevant, the Authority has indicated in assessing due process rights under section 7503(b) that Federal employees suspended for 14 days or less are not entitled to post-suspension proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 45 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Tulsa, Oklahoma</span>, 52 FLRA 1458, 1464 (1997), citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Hawaii Federal Lodge 1998</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1177 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Hawaii Lodge</span>). Such due process rights attach to the predecisional proceedings. <span class="Italic">Hawaii Lodge</span>, 45 FLRA at 1177. In this case, it is not clear whether the Union's contentions involve a claim that the grievant was denied due process at the predecisional or post-decisional stage. However, we would reach the same result in either event based on our conclusion that the grievant was provided sufficient notice to defend against the charge.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 59 FLRA 669, 670 (2004), concluded that an arbitrator properly determined that a grievant who received a three-day suspension received an opportunity to respond to the proposed suspension. That opportunity to reply met due process requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503, that section covers suspensions of 14 days or less. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Okla. City Air Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla.</span>, 47 FLRA 776, 781 n.2 (1993). In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Nat'l Mem'l Cemetery of the Pac.</span>, 45 FLRA 1164, 1175 (1992), the Authority found that employees subject to actions covered by &#x00A7; 7503 have a right to constitutional due process. Such employees are not due post-suspension proceedings but are entitled to pre-decisional proceedings no more formal or extensive than an oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to present his or her side of the story. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1177; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1151</span>, 54 FLRA 20, 26-7 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Local 1151</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the present case, the grievant's three-day suspension is an action covered by &#x00A7; 7503. The grievant was given written notice of his proposed suspension, which set forth an explanation of the Agency's evidence against the grievant. In addition, contrary to the Union's arguments, it is clear that the Agency gave the grievant the opportunity to make an oral reply. He was given ten days, and additional days if requested, from receipt of the notice of proposed suspension to review the material on which the notice was based and to answer it orally, in writing, or both orally and in writing. The Agency further informed the grievant that he <span id="page_2286"></span>could submit affidavits or other evidence in support of his answer and that he had the right to be represented by an attorney or representative of his choice. Thus, the grievant's constitutional and statutory rights to due process were satisfied. <span class="Italic">See Local 1151</span>, 54 FLRA at 27. As the Union provides no basis for finding that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 or that the grievant was denied constitutional due process, we deny the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, because the Agency clearly gave the grievant an opportunity to make an oral reply to the proposed charges against him, the Union's arguments to the contrary provide no basis for finding that the award is deficient as violating a past practice or that the award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, we deny the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Due process protections were not violated, and the arbitrator did not exceed his authority to decide the issue of good cause for a short suspension, when the arbitrator mitigated the suspension to a reprimand but looked to a section of the agency table of penalties that was not specifically referenced by the agency in the suspension proposal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Womack Army Med. Ctr.</span>, 67 FLRA 93, 94-95 (2012), explained that the nature of the conduct was sufficiently noticed in the disciplinary proposal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Arbitrator did not exceed her authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator exceeded her authority by resolving an issue that was not submitted to arbitration.&#x2003;Specifically, the Union claims that the Arbitrator erred in considering the charge of discourtesy because the Agency did not charge the grievant with that offense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). Arbitrators do not exceed their authority when the award is directly responsive to the stipulated issue. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1235, </span>66 FLRA 624, 625 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator resolved the issue submitted by the parties--whether the grievant's three-day suspension was for just cause and taken to promote the efficiency of the service. In resolving the issue, the Arbitrator evaluated the grievant's undisputed conduct and found that the Agency proved the grievant's conduct amounted to an offense for which the Agency could impose discipline--namely, discourtesy. After a thorough review of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the Arbitrator went on to find that a three-day suspension for that conduct was not for just cause, and reduced the penalty to a written reprimand. The award's consideration of just cause, and the award's remedy, are directly responsive to the stipulated issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator expressly found that although the Agency charged the grievant with disorderly conduct in the notice, the Agency "looked to a different charge, [d]iscourtesy, in the [t]able of [p]enalties" in deciding to suspend the grievant for three days. Thus, both charges were related to the issue giving rise to the grievance and the Arbitrator properly considered both charges in addressing the issue as stipulated by the parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 858</span>, 63 FLRA 227, 22930 (2009); <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 181, 183 (2001) (arbitrators do not exceed their authority by resolving issues closely related to the issue giving rise to the grievance); <span class="Italic">NATCA, MEBA/NMU</span>, 51 FLRA 993, 996 (1996) (arbitrators do not exceed their authority by addressing an issue that is necessary to decide a stipulated issue). Consequently, we deny the Union's exceeds-authority exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The award is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union argues that the award is contrary to law because it violates the grievant's due process rights. Specifically, the Union asserts that the award "negat[es] the [grievant's] due process right to know she is charged with discourtesy before she is punished for such a charge."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When exceptions involve an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exceptions and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army &#x0026; the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Union's claim that the grievant's due process right was violated because she did not know what she was charged with, we find that the claim lacks merit. The Arbitrator found that the notice specified the conduct with which the grievant was charged. The Arbitrator found that the notice's "specifications clearly state the alleged conduct underlying the disciplinary event, whether it be termed disrespectful, discourteous, or disorderly." Consequently, finding that the grievant was fully aware of the conduct with which she was charged, the Arbitrator rejected the Union's due process claim. The Union does not challenge the Arbitrator's findings as nonfacts. Accordingly, we find that the Union's due-process exception is unsupported.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) cases cited by the Union did not bind the Arbitrator, and cannot provide a basis for finding her award deficient, because the issue before her involved a suspension of fourteen days or less. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DOJ, Exec. Office for Immigration Review</span>, 66 FLRA 221, 224 (2011) (an arbitrator's failure to apply the same substantive standards as the MSPB in cases involving suspensions of fourteen days or less will not establish that an award is deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator properly concluded that an agency violated a collective bargaining agreement by transcribing an employee's oral reply to a proposed adverse action. FLRA discounted the agency's argument that the award conflicted with the agency's right to determine the technology, methods, and means for doing its work. Section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute provides that nothing shall preclude an agency and a labor organization from negotiating "at the election of the agency," on, among other things, the "technology, methods, and means of performing work." Once a provision covering matters covered by &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) is included in an agreement, the provision is enforceable through grievance arbitration even though the agency could have withdrawn from bargaining on that matter prior to reaching final agreement. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 577-78 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> communications to a deciding official, raising the due process issue of whether the grievant was deprived of due process by denial of a fair opportunity to respond to information considered by the deciding official, were considered in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897 and Dept. of Air Force, Elgin AFB</span>, 67 FLRA 239, 242 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring), referencing <span class="Italic">Stone v. FDIC</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the grievant did not receive notice or an opportunity to respond because the grievant's suspension was based on new and material <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information. For support, the Union cites <span class="Italic">Stone</span>,[43] and Federal Circuit and MSPB precedent applying <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. In <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the Federal Circuit addressed a deciding official's use of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information.[45] The court noted that only <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information that introduces "new and material information to the deciding official will violate the due[-]process guarantee of notice."[46] The court stated that, "[u]ltimately," the inquiry is whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is "so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances."[47] And, in decisions applying <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, the Federal Circuit and the MSPB have held that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is not material if it is not the basis of the discipline.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union acknowledges that these cases involved serious adverse actions under &#x00A7; 7513, rather than discipline under &#x00A7; 7503. However, the Union argues that the Authority should apply these decisions here because both &#x00A7; 7503 and &#x00A7; 7513 "provide for identical statutory protections" that limit an agency's actions to those that are for "such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. It is unnecessary for us to decide whether <span class="Italic">Stone</span> and decisions interpreting it apply to suspensions under &#x00A7; 7503. Even assuming that they do, the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to these decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that it was the grievant's actions--as recorded on video and described in the proposal and the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> memorandum--that "directly resulted in" her suspension. As such, the Arbitrator determined that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information did not "constitute or rise to the level of material information" under <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. Thus, the Arbitrator essentially made a factual finding that the Agency did not rely on the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in imposing the grievant's suspension. The Union does not allege that this factual finding is a nonfact.[53] And, under <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of a contrary-to-law claim, where there is no demonstration that factual findings are nonfacts, the Authority defers to such findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1770</span>, 67 FLRA 93, 95 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By essentially finding that the alleged <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information was not the basis for the suspension and therefore not material, the Arbitrator determined, consistent with Federal Circuit and MSPB precedent, that no constitutional-due-process violation occurred.[55] Further, the decisions that the Union cites do not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's ruling is contrary to law. The first such decision, <span class="Italic">Ross-Rawlins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DE-0752-11-0006-I-1 (Initial Decision, July 8, 2011), is not in the record, and our research has not disclosed it. The Union also cites <span class="Italic">Silberman v. DOL</span>,[57] and <span class="Italic">Gray v. DOD</span>,[58] where the deciding officials used <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information as the basis of their decisions.[59] <span id="page_2287"></span>Here, however, the Arbitrator essentially found that the deciding official did not actually use <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information as the basis of her decision to suspend the grievant.

<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, without deciding, that the precedent that the Union relies on applies in this case,[59] the Union has not demonstrated that the Agency deprived the grievant of due process. The court in <span class="Italic">Stone</span> found that "[o]nly <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications that introduce new and <span class="Italic">material</span> information to the deciding official will violate the due process guarantee of notice."[60] The Union does not cite any authority for the proposition that a deciding official's conversation with human-resources employees to confirm that discipline is consistent with the discipline of other employees is the type of "material" <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication that deprives an employee of constitutional due process.[61] This is especially true where, as is the case here, the deciding official then decides to <span class="Italic">mitigate</span> the penalty that was initially proposed.

<p class="noindent">FLRA discounted an argument that a deciding official improperly considered an aggravating factor in imposing a short suspension, although FLRA did not directly decide whether a better set of facts (for the union) could lead to a different result, <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 121 and GPO</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-25.html">71 FLRA 161</a>, 161-62 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Union argues that the award is contrary to law because it "fail[s] to rescind the suspension due to a violation of the grievant's due process rights." Specifically, the Union argues that the Agency unlawfully considered the grievant's denial of wrongdoing as an "aggravating factor" in deciding to suspend him for fourteen days because the Agency did not notify the grievant of this aggravating factor in the proposal letter.[5]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This argument is unavailing because it is well established that the substantive standards of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) are not binding on arbitrators when they consider actions that cannot be appealed to the MSPB, such as the personnel action here--a fourteen-day suspension.[6] Therefore, the numerous MSPB cases, and those cases appealed from the MSPB to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, cited by the Union are not dispositive.[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union's argument is premised on a misinterpretation of the award.[8] The Arbitrator noted the disparity between the grievant's and the mechanic's suspensions, stated that such a disparity could only be supported if the grievant's misconduct was "more aggravated" and concluded that the grievant's misconduct was <span class="Italic">not</span> "aggravated." Accordingly, the Arbitrator reduced the grievant's suspension to the length of the mechanic's suspension--effectively reversing any allegedly improper consideration of the denial as an aggravating factor. The Arbitrator did not rescind the suspension entirely because he found that the Agency proved the charges by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
