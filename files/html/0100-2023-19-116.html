<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-112"><span class="space">1.</span> Necessity for Accommodation: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ruzek</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Early Board law concerning impaired employees recognized that the Rehabilitation Act reflected the intent of Congress that some protection be provided to federal employees who fall victim to alcoholism. An agency discriminated on the basis of disability if it failed to permit a qualified disabled appellant an opportunity to overcome his impairment. <span class="Italic">Corral v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 209, 212 (1987) ("After his supervisor recommended discipline, but before the agency officially proposed his removal, the appellant completed an alcohol rehabilitation program to which the agency had referred him and returned to work, performing his duties satisfactorily with no further incidents of misconduct."). But the protection was for those who recognized their problem and accepted assistance offered by their employing agencies. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. VA</span>, 19 MSPR 147, 149 (1984) (before the incident that culminated in removal, appellant was offered counseling but declined the treatment program; entry into a treatment program after the incident leading to removal did not require further accommodation). The Board applied its Rehabilitation Act case law to appeals from suitability determinations as well as to adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mattson v. OPM</span>, 8 MSPR 159, 163 (1981) (denying the appellant's assertion that OPM failed to accommodate his disabling condition of alcoholism when OPM rated him ineligible for federal employment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ruzek v. GSA</span>, 7 MSPR 437, 7 MSPB 307 (1981), presents one of the Board's first efforts to define the agency responsibilities to alcoholic employees. The appellant, a guard with 17 years of service, was dismissed for sleeping on duty. In his reply to the adverse action proposal, he informed the agency that he was an alcoholic, had become a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, and had his problem under control. He asked for another chance but was refused. The Board set the legal framework for its discussion by noting that 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(D) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to discriminate <span id="Page_3533"></span>against any employee on the basis of a disabling condition, as defined by &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 791. In a 1977 opinion to DHEW (now DHHS) from the Attorney General, it was determined that alcohol and drug abuse constitute disabling conditions under &#x00A7; 501. 43 Op. Att'y. Gen. No. 12. In 1978, Congress amended the definition of "handicapped individual" in the Rehabilitation Act to exclude alcoholics and drug abusers for purposes of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 793 and 794, concerning employment of qualified disabled individuals by parties contracting with or receiving financial assistance from the federal government. However, because Congress did not extend the exclusion to &#x00A7; 791, pertaining to nondiscrimination against disabled individuals in federal employment, it was concluded that a disabling condition under that section includes alcoholism or drug abuse. Accordingly, the Board found, alcoholism or other drug abuse constitutes a disabling condition under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having decided that the antidiscrimination laws covered alcoholism and drug abuse, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> that 5 USC 7203 prohibits discrimination because of a disabling condition as to those positions that can be performed efficiently by an individual with a disabling condition. 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(1) (2022) [previously situated at 29 CFR 1614.203(c)(1) (2001) and earlier at 29 CFR 1613.704(a)] requires an agency to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified disabled employee unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. The Board reviewed the extent of the required accommodation indicated by the Rehabilitation Act provision that "alcoholism is an illness requiring treatment and rehabilitation." One purpose was the development and encouragement of effective occupational prevention and treatment programs within the government. Another section of the Act provided that a federal civilian employee cannot be removed "solely on the ground of prior substance abuse," but it did not prohibit dismissal of an employee who cannot properly function in his employment. 42 USC 290dd(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> noted that the legislative history of the Alcohol Abuse Act included a committee report expressing the expectation that "the alcoholic employee, like any other employee suffering from a disease, will be provided with an opportunity for treatment instead of being summarily discharged," and that "traditional punitive measures can be expected to have little or no effect on behavior that arises from illness." The Committee said that "an employee who has accepted treatment should be dismissed for medical reasons only when he has been granted sick leave, treatment has repeatedly failed, and he is clearly not capable of meeting the demands of the job." OPM guidelines in the (former) Federal Personnel Manual implementing the Act included the admonition that "[w]hen an employee's use of drugs or alcohol interferes with the efficient and safe performance of his or her assigned duties, reduces his or her dependability or reflects discredit on the agency, federal managers will take action in the form of (1) nondisciplinary procedures affording rehabilitative assistance to an employee with a drinking or drug problem, and (2) failing response resulting in acceptable work performance, invoking regular disciplinary procedures for dealing with problem employees." The FPM continued by stating that if the supervisor discusses below-standard performance with the employee and advises the employee that counseling is available, and no improvement or inadequate improvement in performance occurs, then disciplinary action should be taken on the basis of unsatisfactory work performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering the legal precedents and legislative history, <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> concluded that to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee who is disabled by alcoholism, an agency must offer the employee rehabilitative assistance and allow him an opportunity to take sick leave for treatment, if necessary, before initiating any disciplinary action for continuing performance or misconduct problems related to his alcoholism. In a determination that would subsequently change with the advent of the now-discarded "firm choice" test, discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board determined that in offering rehabilitative assistance, the employee's supervisor need not confront him with the supervisor's belief that the employee has a drinking problem, but he must do more than suggest participation in a rehabilitation program. The supervisor must make the employee aware in general terms that the supervisor suspects the employee has a problem affecting his performance or conduct, and that the supervisor recommends that the employee participate in a particular rehabilitation or counseling program available to him. Casual suggestions to the employee that he should not allow a personal problem like drinking to affect his work, and that the agency would be willing to assist the employee with any problems he may have, are not a sufficient attempt at counseling to constitute reasonable accommodation. Counseling should be specific.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Having determined in <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> that the agency did not provide proper counseling, and considering the appellant's participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and his apparent control over the alcohol problem, the Board decided that the agency should have reasonably accommodated the appellant's disability by canceling the proposed removal action and providing him another chance to come to terms with his problem and its effect on work performance. The appellant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination unrebutted by an agency showing that the reasonable accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. 29 CFR 1630.2(p) (2022) [previously situated at 29 CFR 1614.203(c)(1) (2001) and earlier at 29 CFR 1613.704(a)].The action was reversed as a prohibited personnel practice. 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(D) and 7701(c)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">McGilberry v. DMA</span>, 18 MSPR 560, 563 n.5 (1984), noted that 21 USC 1180 (1984) called for similar agency responsibilities toward drug abusers. <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> would be modified by <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. VA,</span> 37 MSPR 682, 686 n.4 (1988), <span class="Italic">post,</span> to call for accommodation when performance or misconduct problems are caused by, rather than related to, the addictive condition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Keels v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 19, 21 (1981), made clear the agency's obligation to suspend disciplinary action against an individual who seriously pursues rehabilitation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the express public policy prohibiting discrimination in employment based on alcohol abuse, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7203 and 29 USC &#x00A7; 791, and encouraging the prevention and rehabilitation of alcoholism within the Federal Government, 42 USC &#x00A7; 4541, once an employee enrolls in a rehabilitation program, an agency has an obligation to provide the employee with a reasonable period of time to demonstrate success before taking an adverse action. In this case the agency removed appellant before he had a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation. In so doing the agency failed to make reasonable accommodation to appellant's handicap, and because of this, its action must be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analysis underpinning <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> was further explained, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 9 MSPR 569, 573-74 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rules issued through the <span class="Italic">Federal Personnel Manual</span> (FPM) require that employees whose use of drugs or alcohol interferes with the performance of their duties be offered rehabilitative assistance before regular disciplinary procedures are invoked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an employee's use of drugs or alcohol interferes with the efficient and safe performance of his or her assigned duties, reduces his or her dependability or reflects discredit on the agency, Federal managers will take action in the form of (1) non-disciplinary procedures under which an employee with a drinking or drug problem is offered rehabilitative assistance and (2) failing response which results in acceptable work performance, invoking regular disciplinary procedures for dealing with problem employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Supp. 792-2, subch. S1-2(a) (February 29, 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, the FPM stipulates that the alcoholic or drug abuser should be treated "little differently" from other problem employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The supervisor identifies the aspects of job performance that are not satisfactory, consults with the medical or counseling staff, or both, about those cases that appear to be developing a trend, discusses aspects of below-standard performance with the employee and advises him or her of availability of counseling, or if there is no improvement or inadequate improvement in performance, or both, disciplinary actions should be taken, as warranted, solely on the basis of unsatisfactory job performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at subch. S5-1(b). <span class="Italic">See also Spragg v. Campbell,</span> 466 F. Supp. 658, 660 (D.S.D. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case the record shows that the supervisors made appellant aware that they suspected that he had an alcohol abuse problem which affected his attendance and performance. They recommended and tried to assist appellant into a rehabilitation program. <span class="Italic">See Ruzek v. General Services Administration</span>, 7 MSPB 307, 7 M.S. P.R. 437 (1981). When the agency had reason to believe that appellant had not gained control over his alcohol problem, that he had not regained his usefulness as an employee and that he had breached agency leave regulations, it properly invoked regular disciplinary procedures, including its right to exercise its discretion to go outside the schedule of penalties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rhodes v. GSA</span>, 27 MSPR 366, 369 (1985), relying on <span class="Italic">Keels</span>, succinctly stated the agency's responsibility to the alcoholic employee whose discipline is placed in abeyance pending successful completion of a rehabilitation program, and who meets that requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that appellant met the conditions for the continued abeyance of the suspension action related to the August, 1982 incident and, indeed, for the removal of the proposed action based on it from the agency file. The conditions were appellant's successful completion of the detoxification program in approximately 90 days as well as his satisfactory conduct and attendance during this period. Since appellant met the conditions, the agency could not properly reinstate those stale charges and rely on them in this action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Keels v. Department of the Navy,</span> 8 MSPB 385, 386, 9 MSPR 19, 21 (1981) (the agency must provide the employee with a reasonable period of time to show success before taking an adverse action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Konberg v. FAA</span>, 13 MSPR 153, 155 (1982) ("[T]he alcoholic should be treated 'little differently' from other problem employees, if there is no improvement or inadequate improvement in performance after counseling. Ruzek, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 311, 7 MSPR at 443."); <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Gummert v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 130, 131 n.1 (1985) (the same as <span class="Italic">Konberg</span>).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1988 the Board overruled the portions of <span class="Italic">Ruzek</span> that concerned the effect <span id="Page_3534"></span>of rehabilitation as a bar to discipline. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hougens v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 135, 148 (1988) ("Further, the Board herein makes a major departure from its previous precedent and now holds that an agency may impose reasonable discipline for any act of misconduct, short of removal, while at the same time affording the abusing employee an opportunity to rehabilitate.
