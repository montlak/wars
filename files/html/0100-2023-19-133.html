<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-129"><span class="space">a.</span> Requirement of Collective Bargaining Contract, Agency Regulation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 627, 635-36 (1997), noted that, despite <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, provisions of mandatory agency regulations and collective bargaining agreements may impose more stringent accommodative or rehabilitative requirements on the Board than those imposed by MSPB or EEOC cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his cross-petition for review, the appellant renews his argument that the record shows that he is entitled to accommodation under the agency's own requirements.[7] As the EEOC noted in <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, No. 03940100, slip op. at 8 n.8, and we implied in <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, while agencies are no longer obligated by the law to provide the accommodations formerly required for alcoholics, they may voluntarily do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC 12114(c)(4) (employers "may" hold alcoholics to the same standards as non-alcoholics). We find nothing in the ADA or the amended Rehabilitation Act, or their legislative histories, suggesting that the permissive "may" should be read as "must." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 270, 281 (1996) (provision that a failure to comply with a settlement agreement "may" be just cause for removal does not require finding that a violation "will" or "shall" constitute such cause); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 298, 302 (1994) ("'[s]hould' is generally understood to denote a permissive act that involves the exercise of discretion," while "'[s]hall' is generally understood to denote a mandatory action"). Nor do we find any other indication within the Acts that Congress intended to preempt agencies' normal discretion with respect to maintaining discipline among their employees. Accordingly, we hold that our finding that the law does not require accommodation in these circumstances does not preclude the appellant from showing that obligations specific to the Postal Service do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Although agency rules and regulations such as those on which the appellant relies may ultimately derive from statutory anti-discrimination requirements or the discretion granted by law, we find that this claim concerning the alleged rights he is seeking to vindicate properly constitutes an affirmative defense of harmful error rather than discrimination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7702 and 2302, defining disability discrimination and prohibited personnel practice, respectively, solely in terms of the prohibitions of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. We have found, above, that no such discrimination occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with his assertion that he has done so, however. The evidence of record is, to say the least, sparse on the issue, and we find, insufficient to meet the appellant's burden of proof by preponderant evidence. The documentary record contains only two provisions directly concerning the agency's Employee Assistance Program (EAP), section 870 of its Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELRM), and...Article 35 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Both express in general terms the parties' support for self-help programs and state that voluntary participation in EAP will be given favorable consideration in disciplinary actions, but neither appears to set any mandatory rules governing this situation. Indeed, the ELRM specifies that the EAP "is not intended to alter or amend any of the rights or responsibilities of postal employees or of the Postal Service itself' (&#x00A7; 871.12) and that participation in it "does not prohibit disciplinary action for failure to meet acceptable standards of work performance, attendance, and/or conduct" (&#x00A7; 871.31).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the appellant's exhibit also includes Article 2, &#x00A7; 1 of the collective bargaining agreement, which states that "consistent with other provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no unlawful discrimination against handicapped employees, as prohibited by the Rehabilitation Act." This provision, though, is of no benefit to the appellant in fight of our finding that the Act does not prohibit or make discriminatory the agency's failure to accommodate him....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Humphrey v. Dept. of Army</span>, 76 MSPR 519, 524-29 (1997) (accompanied by separate concurring opinions of Chairman Erdreich and Vice Chair Slavet), analyzed an Army regulatory requirement that the agency suspend adverse action and allow an employee to pursue rehabilitation for an alcohol problem when the conduct leading to the charges was the product of the disease. <span class="Italic">Humphrey</span> set aside a suspension for harmful error when the agency did not abide by its regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alcoholism has been recognized to be a disability under the law and continues to be one to this day. <span class="Italic">Cf. Little v. USPS</span>, 66 MSPR 574 (1995) (although under the Rehabilitation Act, a "handicap" was defined to include the addiction to drugs, under the amendments to it contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), current illegal drug users are excluded from its protections). To make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination based on alcoholism, an appellant must prove that he is a qualified individual with a disability and that his alcoholism caused his misconduct or that the misconduct was entirely a manifestation of it. <span class="Italic">See Kye v. DLA</span>, 64 MSPR 570, 573 (1994)....&#8197;The parties agree that the appellant was an alcoholic at the time of his misconduct, and that his <span id="Page_3557"></span>misconduct was related to his alcoholism. Their dispute has centered on the agency's obligation to accommodate that disability by holding its suspension in abeyance while providing the appellant 90 days in which to seek rehabilitation, and to forbear further from imposing it if he demonstrates success in that effort and by his continued acceptable conduct and performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency asserts, one important aspect of the obligation agencies owed to alcoholics has changed in recent years. Specifically, in <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617 (1996), the Board agreed with the view of the EEOC and held that as a result of both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, agencies--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may hold an employee who engages in the illegal use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other employees [sic], even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to the drug use or alcoholism of such employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">42 USC 12114(c)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Kimble</span>, 70 MSPR at 622-23, that agencies no longer need to provide alcoholic employees a firm choice between rehabilitation and discipline, although they remain subject to providing accommodation in certain other forms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More recently, in <span class="Italic">Walsh v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 627, 635-36 (1997), we noted that while agencies are no longer obligated by the law to provide the accommodations formerly required for alcoholics, they may voluntarily do so because the wording of the law is that they "may" hold such employees to the same standards to which they hold others. We further held in <span class="Italic">Walsh</span> that where the appellant shows that he has a right to such accommodation under an agency's own rules, collective bargaining agreements, or policy, he has proven a claim of harmful error rather than disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 635 n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it is axiomatic that an agency's regulations that are contrary to law may not be enforced for that reason, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mica v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 41, 45 (1994); <span class="Italic">Buckley v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 172, 176 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 932 F.2d 980 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), it is equally beyond dispute that an agency must abide by the obligations it takes upon itself in its regulations where no such conflict is present, and that the Board will enforce these requirements, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S. Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed.2d 1012 (1959); <span class="Italic">Giesler v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 3 MSPB 367, 3 MSPR 277, 280 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 686 F.2d 844 (10th Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long applied this rule to the obligations agencies have to employees who are, in some way, disabled as a result of physical, mental, or emotional conditions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Berry v. VA</span>, 25 MSPR 50, 52-53 (1984) (although the agency was not obligated by its Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to grant leave without pay to the appellant, it was required by the terms of its program to refer her there for assistance); <span class="Italic">Gilliam v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 6 MSPB 59, 6 MSPR 57, 60-61 (1981) (the appellant was entitled to counseling and assistance under the agency's EAP prior to being disciplined for his disability-related absences). Further, under <span class="Italic">Walsh</span>, as discussed above, we continue to hold that agencies remain obligated beyond the requirements of the law to provide employees the benefits they have established by rule, regulation, and collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we reject the agency's argument that its own regulations were superseded by the changes in the Rehabilitation Act. As we have found, the law is permissive. It <span class="Italic">allows</span> agencies to hold alcoholic employees to the same standards as non-alcoholics, but does not <span class="Italic">require</span> that they do so. It does not state that they must not provide "firm choice," merely that they are no longer required to do so where that would be inconsistent with their normal standards. Therefore, finding no conflict between the current law and the agency regulations at issue, we hold that the agency is not required to proceed with an adverse action where its own regulations require abeyance under certain circumstances. Thus, if the appellant shows that he has an entitlement to forbearance under the regulations, we further hold that he is not deprived of that benefit by virtue of the changes in the law concerning accommodation of alcoholics.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning, therefore, to the regulations at issue, the relevant provisions are set forth in Army Regulation (AR) 600-85. Paragraph 1-9 p. of those regulations states in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Enrollment of civilian employees and family members [in the agency's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Program (ADAPCP)] is voluntary. However, supervisors may utilize referral for screening services as an alternative to disciplinary action. Disciplinary or administrative action may be suspended in such cases for a period of 90 days. Employees will be offered assistance for alcohol or drug abuse related problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph 5-4, "Responsibilities," at subparagraph d. states, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The objective of ADAPCP services is to upgrade performance or prevent continued deterioration....&#8197;Responsibilities of the supervisor are to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;...intervene as soon as possible when alcohol or drug abuse is adversely affecting an employee's job performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Conduct an interview with the employee, focusing on deteriorating work performance and informing the employee of available counseling services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Conduct a subsequent interview, in followup [sic] to (4) above if job performance does not improve. Provide the employee with a choice of either accepting assistance...or accepting consequences for continuing unsatisfactory job performance or conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Offer to temporarily suspend initiation of disciplinary/adverse action if the employee agrees to seek assistance....&#8197;If the employee enrolls in the ADAPCP, such action will be suspended and subsequently canceled if the employee successfully...completes in [sic] the program and performance and conduct is [sic] satisfactory at the end of 90 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, paragraph 5-5, entitled "Relationship with disciplinary and adverse actions," specifies in part as follows at subparagraph a:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Adverse actions for absenteeism, misconduct, and marginal or unsatisfactory job performance related to alcohol or other drug abuse will be postponed for 90 consecutive days for employees who are currently enrolled in and satisfactorily progressing in the ADAPCP, unless retention in a duty status might result in damage to Government property or personal injury to the employee or others....&#8197;Suspension of adverse/disciplinary action for 90 days will only apply to employees who signed a consent form and have an active consent form currently on file. If the employee refuses rehabilitation assistance or, upon completion of the 90 day period fails to achieve satisfactory job performance and conduct, appropriate adverse action may be taken. Adverse action must be based upon failure to participate in or complete the rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Previously initiated adverse actions in which the final decision letter has not been issued will be postponed upon the employee's enrollment in the ADAPCP, provided the employee has not previously refused rehabilitative assistance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's regulations are not a model of clarity with respect to its obligations to forbear from disciplining alcoholic employees. While paragraph 1-9 can be read as imposing no mandatory abeyance obligation, even it states that employees "will" be offered assistance for alcoholism-related problems. Further, while paragraph 5-4 could be read to impose no obligation on the agency here because the appellant's performance was not the basis for the adverse action under review, we find that even it is not entirely limited to situations in which performance is at issue, since it also addresses "conduct" and "behavior" at certain points.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Focusing, however, on paragraph 5-5, which directly refers to both performance and misconduct, although it, too, is not completely clear, we find that it mandates that the agency forbear disciplining for 90 days both employees who are enrolled in the ADAPCP before the agency initiates adverse action and those who enroll after an adverse action has been initiated. Moreover, although the regulations never explicitly state that upon successful completion of the 90-day period, the agency may not then initiate or proceed with its action, we note that the agency has not argued for such an interpretation of the regulations, and find that it would be unwarranted in any event. The regulation is silent as to what is to occur in that situation, and is, rather, phrased in terms only of what the agency may do if the employee is not successful in achieving rehabilitation. In that regard, it specifies that the adverse action "must" be based on his failure, a requirement that would be nonsensical if it could proceed despite the employee's successful efforts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note...that the agency has not asserted that the appellant is disqualified because his retention would jeopardize Government property or employees (ADAPCP paragraph 5-5a1). Indeed, it retained him on duty during the process leading to his suspension and, of course, he returned to duty thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record, therefore, we conclude that the agency remains obligated by its regulations to provide a period of abeyance for employees enrolled in ADAPCP at the time it initiates adverse action and to forbear from taking such an action upon achievement of a successful result. We find that the appellant complied with the requirements of the regulations and has demonstrated to the agency's satisfaction his still effective rehabilitation efforts. Therefore, the appellant was entitled to the benefit of those regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the agency proceeded with its action and suspended the appellant based, at least in part, on conduct caused by alcoholism. Had <span id="Page_3558"></span>the agency acted as required by its own regulations, no such action relating to this conduct would have been initiated, and none could have been imposed. Accordingly, we conclude that the 31-day suspension, as far as it was based on conduct caused by the appellant's alcoholism, was the result of harmful procedural error and cannot stand. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)] (harmful error is "[e]rror by the agency in the application of its procedures that is likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error"). <span class="Italic">See also Mercer v.</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 859-60 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an adverse action will not be sustained if an employee demonstrates that, in the absence of an agency's procedural error, the outcome could have been different); <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 112 (1983) (only error that prejudices the appellant's substantive rights is harmful), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Adams v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed.2d 358 (1984).</p>
