<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 293, 297 (1993), determined that security clearance revocations or suspensions are not personnel actions under the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he process for deciding whether to revoke a security clearance is analogous to a fitness-for-duty examination because both procedures <span id="Page_3909"></span>are used to determine whether an employee meets the qualifications for his or her position. As the administrative judge found, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, 52 MSPR at 532-33, that a fitness-for-duty examination is not a "personnel action" under 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board found that a fitness-for-duty examination is not included within this statutory provision because it is not similar in nature to other Chapter 75 type actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This same reasoning applies to the revocation of a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Weber was unable to convince a circuit appeals court that a district court improperly failed to order OSC to take action as to the withdrawal of his security clearance. <span class="Italic">Weber v. United States</span>, 209 F.3d 756 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (<span class="Italic">Egan</span> negated the authority to issue a writ of mandamus forcing OSC to investigate the revocation of a security clearance). The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Weber</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">McCabe v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 62 MSPR 641, 648 (1994) ("Thus, we will not review the revocation of the appellant's SAP security clearance, the creation of a security file, and the appellant's detail out of Detachment 8."). That decision was affirmed on review in <span class="Italic">McCabe v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 nonprecedential No. 94-3463):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the board that the revocation of McCabe's access to classified information was not a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA. Under <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), an agency's decision to grant or deny a security clearance is not judicially reviewable, except to the extent that an agency must follow any applicable procedures. "It should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance. The grant of a clearance requires an affirmative act of discretion on the part of the granting official." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528. Given the high degree of discretion involved in matters of national security, we are convinced that Congress did not intend that agency decisions regarding security clearance status be encompassed within the definition of "personnel action" under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCabe contends <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not applicable to his IRA appeal because <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was concerned with an "adverse action" under Chapter 75 of Title 5 and his appeal involves a "personnel action" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512 <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2). Although we agree there are differences between the two types of actions--adverse actions being a subset of personnel actions, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(iii)--the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> leaving matters of security access to the discretion of the executive branch, applies with equal relevance to any judicial review of security clearance status, including one that is alleged to be a personnel action under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McCabe also contends that his disclosure was a contributing factor in his detail out of Detachment 8 and that the agency has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that it would have detailed him absent his disclosure. Details are personnel actions under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(iv). McCabe's argument fails, however, because his detail was merely a necessary incident of the revocation of his security clearance and, as discussed above, McCabe cannot challenge the merits of that revocation. McCabe's work in Detachment 8 required him to have special access to classified information. When that special access was revoked, irrespective of the reason for the revocation, he could no longer work in Detachment 8. We do not understand McCabe to argue that the Air Force chose to detail him out of the Detachment in lieu of other alternatives (e.g., reassignment, administrative leave) as reprisal for his disclosure. Rather the record is clear that McCabe again seeks impermissibly to argue the merits of the revocation of his security clearance in the context of his detail.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 464, 471-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-54 (1999), declining to characterize revocation of a security clearance as a personnel action or change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions subject to an IRA appeal, discussed the effect of the 1994 amendments to the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994...Congress amended the WPA in several respects, including the definition of a "personnel action" in section 2302(a)(2). Action leading to this change began on March 19, 1993, when Senator Levin introduced S. 622, a bill to authorize appropriations for the OSC and the Board. This bill contained several proposed changes to 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), including adding psychiatric testing or examination to the list of enumerated personnel actions. S. 622, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993); 139 Cong. Rec. S3276 (daily ed. Mar. 19, 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 6, 1993, Representative McCloskey introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives to reauthorize OSC. H.R. 2970, as amended on August 9, 1994, also proposed additions to the personnel actions enumerated in section 2302(a)(2). It similarly included psychiatric testing or examination, and also included a denial, revocation, or other decision relating to a security clearance. H.R. 2970, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 23, 1994, the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs issued its report accompanying a different version of S. 622. This bill still included a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination as a personnel action, but now also included an amendment to 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). S. Rep. No. 358 at 9, 19 (1994). That section had prohibited any employee from taking, or failing to take, a "personnel action" with respect to any employee or applicant for employment as a reprisal for disclosing information that the employee or applicant reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (1988). Section 5(d) of S. 622, however, proposed to amend section 2302(b)(8) by inserting "or otherwise discriminate or retaliate against" after the words "personnel action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Committee explained that this addition addressed the WPA's narrow construction regarding the types of retaliatory action for which remedies were available. It noted that many retaliatory actions fell outside the statute's enumerated definitions of personnel actions, and cited an agency's relieving an employee of high-profile assignments, and a loss of a security clearance as examples of retaliation that the WPA was enacted to remedy. The Committee stated that the WPA was intended to create a clear remedy for all cases of retaliation or discrimination against whistleblowers, and that such retaliation must be prohibited regardless of the form it may take. It stated that it intended this change to cover any discriminatory or retaliatory action taken against a whistleblower because of protected conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 9-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 30, 1994, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service submitted its report accompanying H.R. 2970, which specifically included the denial, revocation, or other determination relating to a security clearance as a personnel action. H. Rep. No. 769, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. at 37 (1994). The committee expressed its belief that the WPA had a "plethora" of coverage gaps that left many reprisal victims defenseless. It stated that the ten personnel actions listed in section 2302(a)(2)(A) reflected the outer boundaries for whistleblower protection, that the list had not kept pace with the "creativity of effective harassment tactics," and that two of the "most glaring omissions" concerned mandatory psychiatric examinations and security clearance actions. The Committee noted that security clearances were preconditions of employment for nearly three million federal and contract workers, that employers could "<span class="Italic">de facto</span> terminate" an employee by removing the clearance, and that federal workers had no functional due process rights to defend their clearances, leaving them defenseless against "back door" retaliation when a forthright attempt at firing could not succeed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 14-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Committee further stated that the bill was intended to legislatively convert Executive Branch security clearance decisions into personnel decisions that employees could allege constituted prohibited personnel practices. The Committee, however, also noted an exception to this rule, stating that a security clearance decision did not, in and of itself, constitute a decision to permit or allow access to sensitive information, and that it recognized that information access determinations were Executive Branch prerogatives. Thus, the Committee stated that the bill's amendment to the list of personnel actions did not cover decisions concerning an individual's access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), which consists of particularly sensitive classified material relating to intelligence sources, methods, or analytical processes, and that such decisions were not subject to review by the Board or the courts. The Committee also stated that it did not intend <span id="Page_3910"></span>that jurisdiction be limited to the listed personnel actions, and that many forms of unlisted harassment constituted threats that chilled or defeated the exercise of merit system rights. It included retaliatory investigations, reorganizations, reductions in force, and defunding of positions as examples of unlisted personnel actions<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 3, 1994, the Senate agreed to an amendment to S. 622 that eliminated section 5(d), which would have amended section 2302(b)(8), and replaced it with, among other things, the addition to subsection (a)(2) of any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 140 Cong. Rec. S13,960 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1994). That same day, the House passed its version of H.R. 2970, that included as a personnel action a denial, revocation, or other determination relating to a security clearance. Representative McCloskey explained that the bill expanded the definition of personnel actions to include several practices that were not yet covered, but that could have a debilitating effect on an employee's career. He said that the expanded definition of personnel action attempted to "level the playing field" for employees in these difficult cases. 140 Cong. Rec. H10,617 (daily ed. Oct. 3, 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 7, 1994, the Senate considered and passed an amendment to H.R. 2970. This version of the bill included two new enumerated personnel actions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Subsection (x) included a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination, and a new subsection (xi) included "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 140 Cong. Rec. S14,668-70, 14,884-85 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994). The House also considered and agreed with the Senate's amendment, which did not specifically list a denial or revocation of a security clearance as a personnel action, but did include "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 140 Cong. Rec. H11,419 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994). In asking for unanimous consent for the legislation, Representative McCloskey stated that he was particularly concerned with providing protections against abusive practices, such as ordering psychiatric examinations arbitrarily, and arbitrarily suspending or terminating security clearances, and that nothing in the Senate amendment affected these aspects of the early versions of the House bill. Representative McCloskey added that, consistent with the WPA's remedial purpose, the addition of "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities or working conditions" to the listed personnel actions should be interpreted broadly, and that "personnel action" is intended to include any harassment or discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system. He said that examples include, among others, the denial, revocation, or suspension of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at H11,421. The President signed H.R. 2970 into law on October 29, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) now provides that a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions constitutes a "personnel action." Because this definition and its legislative history could support the conclusion that the suspension, revocation, or denial of a security clearance is a personnel action under the WPA that could be pursued with the Board in an IRA appeal, the Board invited interested parties to file <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs in this appeal, and the related case of <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 82 MSPR 489 (1999) on the issues of whether the Board has authority to adjudicate whistleblower retaliation claims involving an appellant's security clearance, and, if so, whether there are limits pertaining to the scope of that authority....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon considering all of the above submissions, and the relevant case law, statutory provisions and legislative history, we find that the denial, revocation, or suspension of a security clearance is not a personnel action under the 1994 amendments to the WPA, and the Board, therefore, continues to lack jurisdiction over such claims in an IRA appeal or as a whistleblowing retaliation affirmative defense claim in a Chapter 75 appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we reject OPM and DOJ's argument that the denial, revocation, or suspension of a security clearance is not a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, and is, therefore, beyond the scope of the WPA amendments. As OSC correctly argues, the Board has held that it will construe the WPA broadly, and we find that adverse security clearance determinations are tantamount to a change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Federal Bureau of Investigation,</span> 71 F.3d 513, 514 (5th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Ohio National Guard</span>, 77 MSPR 583, 587 (1998). Thus, adverse security clearance determinations are not excluded from the statute's meaning on the theory that they are akin to a license or a condition of employment, rather than an actual change in duties, responsibilities or working conditions, as some of the amici argued. We must, therefore, examine whether Congress's inclusion of "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities or working conditions" as a personnel action otherwise authorizes the Board to review security clearance determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court examined whether the Board had authority to review security clearance determinations in the context of an adverse action appeal under 5 USC Chapter 75. It held that, unless Congress specifically provided otherwise, the Board lacked authority to review adverse security clearance determinations, and the agency head who had been delegated authority over such decisions by the President had the discretion to protect the classified information for which he was responsible. The Court found that Chapter 75 did not specifically grant the Board such authority, that Congress's failure to specifically exclude security clearance matters from the Board's jurisdiction did not mean that those determinations fell under the Board's scope of review, and that review authority over security clearance determinations must be specifically included in the statute because of national security concerns. In finding that this statute did not confer such authority to the Board, however, the Court also indicated that Congress had the constitutional authority to delegate review over these traditionally Executive Branch decisions, but that because of concerns with separation of powers and national security, Congress was required to grant such authority specifically. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, at 527-30, 108 S. Ct. 818.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> interpreted a different statutory provision than the one before us. In finding the above, it was deciding the limited question of whether the Board had jurisdiction over security clearance determinations in connection with adverse actions taken pursuant to 5 USC Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, at 520, 108 S. Ct. 818. The issue before us, however, concerns the breadth of the 1994 amendments to the WPA, that Congress enacted after <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Thus, the question is whether Congress has now given the Board authority to review security clearance determinations in connection with whistleblowing claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not directly resolve this question, it provides the standard for reviewing legislation to determine whether Congress has empowered the Board to review these typically Executive Branch determinations, and other courts have applied this standard to determine whether Congress provided authority to review security clearance determinations raised in connection with other legislation, such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These courts have found such authority lacking where the statutes did not contain a specific, unmistakable expression of intent to allow review of security clearance decisions<span class="Italic">. See Brazil v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 193, 196-97 (9th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Guillot v. Garrett</span>, 970 F.2d 1320, 1323-26 (4th Cir. 1992)<span class="Italic">. See also Dorfmont v. Brown</span>, 913 F.2d 1399 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the Court's standard to the WPA's 1994 amendments yields the conclusion that Congress has not authorized the Board to review security clearance determinations as personnel actions in whistleblowing appeals. The inclusion of the broad category of "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" does not show the unmistakable expression of intent to allow review of security clearance determinations that the Court mandated in <span class="Italic">Egan. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 530, 108 S. Ct. 818; <span class="Italic">Brazil</span>, 66 F.3d at 197. In this regard, we disagree with OSC's argument that Congress has satisfied the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> specificity requirement by providing for a broad all-inclusive category that necessarily includes security clearance determinations because it does not exclude them. In <span class="Italic">Brazil</span>, the Ninth Circuit rejected the similar argument, pertaining to section 717(a) of Title VII. There, the employee argued that a security clearance determination could be reviewed in connection with this statute, which provided that "all personnel actions" affecting employees be made absent from discrimination. The court found, however, that the broad phrase "all personnel actions" did not evidence the unmistakable expression of purpose necessary to conclude that Congress intended judicial review of security clearance determinations in Title VII claims. 66 F.3d at 197; <span class="Italic">see also Guillot</span>, 970 F.2d at 1325.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also recognize, however, that, in analyzing these other statutes, the courts noted the absence of intent to allow review of security clearance determinations in the statutes' legislative histories<span class="Italic">. See Egan</span>, at 530-31, 531 n.6, 108 S. Ct. 818; <span class="Italic">Brazil</span>, 66 F.3d at 197; <span class="Italic">Guillot</span>, 970 F.2d at 1325. As mentioned above, however, portions of the legislative history of the WPA's amendments reveal some congressional intent to protect whistleblowers from retaliatory adverse security clearance determinations. We find, however, that to the extent Congress may have expressed such concerns while debating the amendments, it failed to effectuate that intent because it ultimately enacted language that lacked the specificity mandated by the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Finally, in light of our conclusion that Congress did not provide the Board with authority over security clearance decisions in whistleblower appeals, we need not address the remaining issues contained in our Federal Register notice, including questions concerning the analytical framework and burden of proof in these cases. Our decision here also, of course, means that the Board continues to lack jurisdiction over security clearance issues in Chapter 75 appeals as well.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dept. of State</span>, 82 MSPR 489, 492-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dept. of State</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20001589217f3d137211419">217 F.3d 1372</a> (Fed. Cir. 2000), <span class="Italic">post</span>, applied <span class="Italic">Roach</span> to preclude IRA jurisdiction over an indefinite suspension pending a final determination on a security clearance, but <span class="Italic">Hesse</span> maintained the Board's existing limited jurisdiction to ensure that minimal due process was applied to the clearance review process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3911"></span>In light of our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Roach</span>, we find that the administrative judge correctly held that the Board has limited jurisdiction over adverse actions, such as the appellant's indefinite suspension, that are based upon the denial, revocation, or suspension of a security clearance. The Supreme Court has held that the Board does not have authority to review the substance of the underlying security clearance determination in an adverse action appeal under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513 that is based on the denial or revocation of a security clearance, and that the Board's review is limited to determining whether the agency provided the employee with the procedural protections required under section 7513. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 530-31, 108 S. Ct. 818, 98 L. Ed.2d 918 (1988). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has similarly held that an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee pending a determination on whether his security clearance should be terminated. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was not entitled to a reassignment. To be entitled to a reassignment to non-sensitive duties, the appellant was required to show that the agency had a policy, manifested by regulations, requiring such reassignment.... Although the appellant identified regulations that purportedly required such reassignment, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency was not required to reassign the appellant in lieu of suspending him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also correctly found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over allegations of discrimination in connection with the suspension or revocation of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Hinton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 692, 697 (1994). We further find that the appellant's allegation, that the agency suspended his security clearance and then suspended him in reprisal for his whistleblowing activity, is not properly before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Roach,</span> 82 MSPR at 481-84. In reaching this conclusion, we note that it is unclear whether the appellant is attempting to raise his whistleblowing claim as an affirmative defense under 5 USC Chapter 75, or in an IRA appeal, because he filed a Board petition for appeal simultaneously with a request for corrective action with the OSC. We need not resolve this issue, however, because under <span class="Italic">Roach</span>, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the security clearance claim under either statutory scheme.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed in <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dept. of State</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20001589217f3d137211419">217 F.3d 1372</a>, 1376-80 (Fed. Cir. 2000), construing ambiguous legislative history against the right of Board review of whistleblowing reprisal implications of a security clearance determination leading to an adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The principles we draw from the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> are these: (1) there is no presumption that security clearance determinations will be subject to administrative or judicial review, as those determinations are committed to the broad discretion of the responsible Executive Branch agency; (2) unless Congress specifically provides otherwise, the Merit Systems Protection Board is not authorized to review security clearance determinations or agency actions based on security clearance determinations; and (3) when an agency action is challenged under the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5, the Board may determine whether a security clearance was denied, whether the security clearance was a requirement of the appellant's position, and whether the procedures set forth in section 7513 were followed, but the Board may not examine the underlying merits of the security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">See King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 662-63 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Department of the Army</span>, 49 F.3d 1566, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Lyles v. Department of the Army</span>, 864 F.2d 1581, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not directly controlling in this case, for two reasons. First, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> involved only chapter 75 of title 5, and in particular 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513, the statute governing appeals from adverse agency actions. It did not involve chapter 12 of title 5, and in particular 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(a), the provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) that permits employees, after seeking review from the Office of Special Counsel, to obtain review of claims that they have been subjected to adverse personnel actions in retaliation for whistleblowing. The Board in Mr. Hesse's case noted that it was unclear whether Mr. Hesse was limiting himself to an appeal under section 7513, or whether he was also attempting to invoke section 1221(a), since he sought corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel simultaneously with filing the Board appeal from his suspension. The Board found it unnecessary to decide that question, however, as it concluded that the analysis of the central legal issue was the same under both statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, unlike <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, this case involves a claim of whistleblowing. Mr. Hesse contends that the suspension of his security clearance is a "prohibited personnel practice" under the statute protecting whistleblower disclosures, 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302, even if, as <span class="Italic">Egan</span> held, it is not reviewable in a case involving the more restrictive class of generally appealable agency actions set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding those distinctions, we are persuaded that the principles underlying the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision are applicable here and support the Board's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the propriety of the suspension of Mr. Hesse's security clearance. The presence of a possible claim under section 1221(a), which was not present in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, does not call for a different result in this case because, as the Board concluded, the dispositive question under both statutes is the same: whether the Merit Systems Protection Board is authorized to review security clearance determinations and require that employees' security clearances be granted or reinstated. Under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the answer to that question under section 7513(d) was no. The Court based its answer on the principle that Executive Branch agencies must be given broad discretion in making security clearance determinations, and that it would be improper, without a clear directive from Congress, to allow a nonexpert body, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, to review the merits of such determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts have applied those policies in a variety of other contexts. For example, other courts have held that security clearance determinations are not subject to judicial review in the context of a direct action by a private or government employee contesting the denial of a security clearance, <span class="Italic">see Dorfmont v. Brown</span>, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401-02 (9th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Jamil v. Secretary, Dep't of Defense,</span> 910 F.2d 1203, 1206 (4th Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 844 F.2d 1407, 1413 (10th Cir. 1988); an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, <span class="Italic">see Ryan v. Reno</span>, 168 F.3d 520, 523 (D.C. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Becerra v. Dalton</span>, 94 F.3d 145, 149 (4th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Perez v. FBI</span>, 71 F.3d 513, 514-15 (5th Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Brazil v. United States Dep't of the Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 193, 196-98 (9th Cir. 1995); an action under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <span class="Italic">see Guillot v. Garrett</span>; 970 F.2d 1320, 1324-25 (4th. Cir. 1992); and an action under the Foreign Service Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">United States Info. Agency v. Krc</span>, 905 F.2d 389, 395-97 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The same policies apply to the review that Mr. Hesse urges the Board to conduct under the aegis of the WPA. Accordingly, absent a clear indication from Congress that the Board was meant to review security clearance determinations when raised in an appeal under the WPA, the principles of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> compel a similar result in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That leads us to the second proposed distinction of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, which requires us to answer the question whether anything in the whistleblower protection provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act constitutes the kind of specific congressional authorization for the Merit Systems Protection Board to review security clearance determinations that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> found wanting in chapter 75 of title 5. As originally enacted, the Civil Service Reform Act plainly did not contain any such specific authorization for the Board to review security clearance determinations. At that time, as now, the Act provided that an employee could obtain relief if the employee was subjected to any "personnel action" in retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (1988). The Act listed 10 personnel actions, the last of which was a catch-all category. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2) (1988). The first nine of the listed personnel actions were clearly inapplicable to Mr. Hesse's case, as they did not include a security clearance determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(i)-(ix) (1988). The only other candidate, the catch-all clause, defined "personnel action" to include "any other significant change in duties or responsibilities which is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level." 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(x) (1988). That provision, however, clearly does not constitute explicit congressional authorization to review security clearance determinations, because a security clearance is a prerequisite of employment in certain positions or of the performance of certain tasks, not a "duty or responsibility" of a position. It could be argued that the denial or revocation of a security clearance has an effect on the employee's duties and responsibilities, and that for that reason the catch-all provision should be interpreted to include security clearance determinations, but whatever the merits of that argument, it certainly cannot be said that the catch-all clause in the original version of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2) constituted a specific statement of congressional intent to allow review of such determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In pressing his argument that section 2302(a)(2) reaches security clearance determinations, Mr. Hesse focuses on the 1994 amendment to that provision. It was at that time, he contends, that Congress made clear that it intended security clearance determinations to be treated as "personnel actions" for purposes of section 2302(a)(2) and thus to be reviewable in an action brought under the whistleblower protection provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act. The problem with that argument, however, is that the amended version of the Civil Service Reform Act is no more explicit in authorizing review of security clearance determinations than was the original version.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only pertinent change in the Act made as a result of the 1994 amendment was in the catch-all clause of section 2302(a)(2). As noted, the original version of the catch-all clause read as follows: "any other significant change in duties or responsibilities which is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level." The 1994 amendment changed the language of the catch-all clause to read as follows: "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." Although the two versions of the catch-all clause are somewhat different, the new <span id="Page_3912"></span>language, like the old, does not advert in any way to security clearance determinations. The new language referring to "working conditions" most naturally connotes the physical conditions under which an employee labors, although it is possible to give it a broader interpretation to mean the conditions that the employee must satisfy to qualify for the job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Sch. v. Federal Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 645, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 109 L. Ed.2d 659 (1990). In any event, the amended language is at best ambiguous and thus falls far short of constituting a specific statement of congressional intent to authorize review of security clearance determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Hesse directs our attention to the legislative history of the 1994 amendment, which, unlike the statute itself, contains references to security clearance determinations. After a close review of the legislative history, however, we are not persuaded that it supports Mr. Hesse's argument, even if legislative history alone could provide the specificity required by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What the legislative history makes clear is that some in Congress wanted the Board to review security clearance determinations in the context of actions brought by whistleblowers. What is left far from clear, however, is whether that position was intended to be incorporated in the legislation that Congress actually enacted. Indeed, the changes in the proposed statutory language that occurred during the legislative process suggest the opposite.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The House bill to expand the protection for whistleblowers proposed to amend section 2302(a)(2) of title 5 by adding two new provisions to the list of personnel practices: the first was "a decision to require psychiatric testing or examination," and the second was "a denial, revocation, or other determination relating to a security clearance." H.R. 2970, 103rd. Cong. &#x00A7; 4(a)(1)(B) (1994). The House Report accompanying the bill made clear that the bill was intended to permit review of security clearance determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-769, at 15 (1994) (the bill "is intended to legislatively convert Executive branch security clearance decisions into personnel decisions that an employee can allege constitute prohibited personnel practices").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Senate employed a different approach. Rather than amending section 2302(a)(2), the Senate bill proposed to amend section 2302(b)(8) to proscribe any action taken by an agency to discriminate against or retaliate against an employee because of protected whistleblowing conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. 622, 103rd Cong. &#x00A7; 5(d) (1994). Although the statutory language was less specific than the House bill, the Senate Report suggested that the committee intended the Senate bill to include the loss of a security clearance, because the committee included a reference to the loss of security clearance as one of two examples of conduct that it intended the new legislation to cover. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 103358, 103rd Cong. 2d Sess. at 10 (1994), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1994 at pp. 3549, 3558.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The House bill passed the House in the form reported by the House committee (except for some changes not pertinent here), <span class="Italic">see</span> 140 Cong. Rec. 27,361 (1994), but the House bill was not enacted into law, nor was the bill reported by the Senate committee. The statute as ultimately enacted contained neither the specific reference to security clearances that was found in the House bill, nor the broad language from the Senate bill that would have made any retaliatory action reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board. In the statute as enacted, the only change in the pertinent portions of the WPA was the small change in the language of the catchall clause of section 2302(a)(2), which, as we noted earlier, falls far short of an explicit statement of congressional intent to subject security clearance determinations to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There was little debate on the final version of the bill. Representative McCloskey, a strong advocate of permitting review of security clearances, argued that even though the version of the bill that was enacted omitted reference to security clearances, the Act still should be read broadly, to prohibit "arbitrarily suspending or terminating security clearances." <span class="Italic">See</span> Cong. Rec. 29,352-53 (1994) (remarks of Rep. McCloskey). The Supreme Court, however, has warned us to be "wary of relying on the remarks of a single legislator," <span class="Italic">Texas Indus., Inc. v. Radcliff Materials, Inc.</span>, 451 U.S. 630, 644 n.17, 101 S. Ct. 2061, 68 L. Ed.2d 500 (1981), and in light of Representative McCloskey's strong views on the matter, his remarks may simply reflect the hope that the enacted language would be interpreted as if the language he favored had actually been included in the legislation, even though it was not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress's failure to enact the versions of the bill proposed by the two committees seriously undermines the force of Mr. Hesse's argument, which is based heavily on language from the two committee reports. It is reasonable to conclude that by declining to enact the language of either reported bill that would have governed security clearance determinations, Congress rejected the suggestion in the committee reports that the Merit Systems Protection Board should be authorized to review security clearance determinations in the context of whistleblower actions. <span class="Italic">See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co.</span>, 419 U.S. 186, 200, 95 S. Ct. 392, 42 L. Ed.2d 378 (1974) (Congress's failure to enact a proposed version of a statute "strongly militates against a judgment that Congress intended a result that it expressly declined to enact"). In any event, however, the legislative history does not provide clear support for Mr. Hesse's contention that Congress intended to include security clearance determinations within the scope of personnel actions covered by the Act. Thus, even if under some circumstances legislative history could be strong enough to constitute the specific statement of congressional intent that the Supreme Court required in the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> case, it is not strong enough in this instance.[*] Accordingly, we agree with the Board that because 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), like the statute reviewed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, lacks specific language authorizing the Board to review security clearance determinations, the Board was correct to conclude that it lacks authority to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The lack of clear guidance from the legislative history does not end with the fact that Congress did not enact either of the reported bills in the form in which it was reported. Even the House Report is damaging to Mr. Hesse's case in one important respect. Although the language of the House bill appears helpful to Mr. Hesse, the House Report noted a qualification to the bill's seemingly broad language. The House committee explained that its proposed amendment making security clearance determinations subject to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board would "not cover decisions concerning an individual's access to Sensitive Compartmentalized Information (SCI) [i.e., certain particularly sensitive classified materials].... Decisions with respect to controlling access to SCI...are not subject to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board or the courts under this legislation." H.R. No. 103-769, at 15 (1994). Mr. Hesse contends in his brief that "it was the absence of SCI clearance which led to the decision...to remove [him] from his position." If we were to credit that statement and give full credence to the statement by the House committee that SCI access determinations were not meant to fall within the reach of the new legislation, we would have to uphold the Board's ruling even if we concluded that Congress meant for the language that was ultimately enacted to be fully equivalent to the language that was in the House bill. We do not rest our judgment on that point, but we note that it demonstrates that even the legislative history on which Mr. Hesse relies is not uniformly favorable to his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true, as Mr. Hesse asserts, that the Board's construction of section 2302(a)(2) will leave federal employees without recourse to the Board or the Special Counsel if they believe they have been denied security clearances in retaliation for whistleblowing. Employees, however, are not left wholly without recourse. As is illustrated by this case and its companion, the <span class="Italic">Roach</span> case, employees typically have internal appeal procedures within their agencies through which to object to adverse decisions on security clearance issues. Moreover, because individual supervisors are typically not involved in the security clearance adjudication process, the risk of retaliation for protected disclosures may be less in this context than in others. Perhaps for that reason, as the Special Counsel noted in her brief before the Board, the Office of Special Counsel has received only a handful of claims alleging whistleblower retaliation in the context of a security clearance determination since the 1994 amendments to the Civil Service Reform Act. We thus view with some skepticism Mr. Hesse's suggestion that the Board's jurisdictional ruling in this case, if affirmed, will create a huge loophole in the protection afforded to federal employees by the whistleblower protection provisions of that Act. In any event, when Congress amended the Act in 1994 it chose not to give express authority to the Board to review security clearance determinations, even though at the time the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> Court had made quite clear that an explicit statement of Board authority was required. <span class="Italic">See Cannon v. University of Chicago</span>, 441 U.S. 677, 696-99, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 60 L. Ed.2d 560 (1979) (noting that Congress is presumed to know the law, particularly recent precedents that are directly applicable to the issue before it). Thus, because the Act does not specifically authorize the Board to review security clearance determinations, it cannot serve as a basis for Board jurisdiction in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hesse</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Knapp v. MSPB,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211117165">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), determining that MSPB correctly declined jurisdiction over an indefinite suspension and other job-related actions that resulted from improper emailing of classified information by a person who sought to make or support allegedly protected disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Knapp was employed as a civilian Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Victim Advocate for the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. On March 12, 2018, Ms. Knapp wrote to a senator regarding retaliation against soldiers who reported sexual harassment and assault during her time as a Victim Advocate. On August 10, 2018, Ms. Knapp emailed classified information over an unclassified network, which is referred to as "spillage." On August 23, 2018, Ms. Knapp disclosed additional violations of Department of Defense reporting procedures during a meeting with <span id="Page_3913"></span>USASOC officials. That same day, USASOC officials ordered the removal of Ms. Knapp's computer, quarantined the device, and erased the hard drive. On September 21, 2018, Ms. Knapp forwarded the August 10th email containing classified information to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On October 1, 2018, Ms. Knapp's security clearance was suspended, and she was placed on administrative leave because of this additional spillage. On February 26, 2019, the Army proposed indefinite suspension from duty and pay status for Ms. Knapp based on the two spillage incidents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 8, 2019, Ms. Knapp filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that she made several protected whistleblowing disclosures during her employment as a Victim Advocate. She also alleged that less than a month after making protected disclosures to the USASOC, she was accused of spillage, subjected to an administrative investigation, and indefinitely suspended from duty and pay status while her security clearance was reviewed. Ms. Knapp also alleged that she received a performance appraisal of "unacceptable" even though she was rated as "outstanding" in the prior year. Upon filing an administrative grievance, Ms. Knapp's appraisal was changed to "fully successful." On November 21, 2019, OSC informed Ms. Knapp that it had terminated its investigation into her complaint and that she had the right to file an individual right of action (IRA) appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Supreme Court held that the Board does not have authority to review the substance of an underlying security clearance determination while reviewing an adverse action because the power to grant and revoke a security clearance is a judgment call exclusively retained by the executive branch. 484 U.S. at 520, 529-30; <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v. Dep't of State,</span> 217 F.3d 1372, 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (explaining that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the merits of an agency's security clearance determination). Here, Ms. Knapp asks the Board to do exactly that. Ms. Knapp's August 10 and September 21, 2018 emails contained classified information sent over an unclassified network. The Army responded to these two spillage incidents with a security clearance investigation and disciplinary actions directly related to Ms. Knapp's security access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All of the actions taken by the Army were based either on its determination that Ms. Knapp committed security violations or on the Army's decision to suspend her clearance because of these violations. Because the personnel actions taken against Ms. Knapp all related to her access to classified information and spillage, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is controlling. While Ms. Knapp's situation may be sympathetic, the law is clear and we cannot provide the relief Ms. Knapp requests.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board may not review the appellant's loss of clearance, or an action based on the loss of clearance, the Board may consider allegations that an appellant made protected disclosures that agency employees or contractors are violating security procedures, <span class="Italic">Briley v. NARA</span>, 236 F.3d 1373, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]iting 484 U.S. 518 (1988), the Board held that it lacked jurisdiction to review Briley's claims regarding Bilger's security clearance approval. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court held that the Board does not have authority to review the substantive merits of the agency's decision to deny security clearance to the employee<span class="Italic">. See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 526-30. This court has subsequently held that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review an employee's claim that his or her security clearance was suspended in retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Hesse v. Dep't of State</span>, 217 F.3d 1372, 1375-80 (Fed. Cir. 2000). The situations in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, however, are substantially different from this case: Briley claims that she was retaliated against because she raised questions about the appropriateness of Bilger's access to classified information. To redress Briley's claim, the Board would not necessarily be required to trespass on territory forbidden to it by <span class="Italic">Egan:</span> it would have no need to overrule the agency's determination of whether Bilger should or should not have access to classified information. The protection of classified information would remain "committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529. Instead, the Board would only be required to determine whether Briley made a disclosure which she reasonably believed violated a law, rule, or regulation related to security classifications. Nor does this case involve a question whether Briley's own security clearance was suspended in retaliation for whistleblowing, as in <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In IRA appeals the Board evaluates agency-initiated denials of certifications other than security clearances. The Board considered the merits of a claim that the certification of an employee for a Personnel Reliability Program (PRP) was lifted, and other adverse job actions resulted, from whistleblowing reprisal. <span class="Italic">Griego v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-1221-15-0427-W-1 (NP 3/11/2016). Without a demonstrable impact on pay and benefits, an IRA appeal that contended the agency denied the appellant certification as a mineral examiner, without adversely affecting his duties, was not within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Paul v. USDA</span>, 66 MSPR 643, 648-49 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this IRA appeal because the agency action that the appellant complained of, denial of certification as a mineral examiner, is not a personnel action as defined at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2). He analogized the appeal to those in which appellants argued that revocation of a security clearance and an order to undergo a fitness for duty examination were personnel actions under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), which lists an action under chapter 75 of Title 5 or other disciplinary or corrective action among the definitions of "personnel action." In <span class="Italic">Weber v. Department of the Army</span>, 59 MSPR 293, 297 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 26 F.3d 140 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), cited by the administrative judge, the Board held that revocation of a security clearance was not a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii) because it was not similar in nature to a chapter 75 type action. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 MSPR 529, 531-33 (1992), the Board held that an order to submit to a fitness for duty examination was not a personnel action because it was not a "disciplinary or corrective action" as contemplated by 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). The Board further held that the order did not fall within any of the other definitions of personnel action because it was merely an attempt to elicit information upon which a pay or personnel decision could be made. <span class="Italic">Caddell</span>, 52 MSPR at 533. The administrative judge in this appeal found that the denial of certification was similar to revocation of a security clearance and an order to undergo a fitness for duty examination because it also had to do with an employee's qualifications for a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the circumstances in this appeal with regard to the denial of certification are somewhat similar to those in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 393, 400 (1994), in which, the Board stated that it has not restrictively interpreted the meaning of "personnel action" as set forth at section 2302(a)(2)(A). In <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, the Board found that the agency's failure to waive qualification requirements for a vacant position after the appellant's position was abolished by a reduction in force was a personnel action. The Board agreed with the appellant's argument that the failure to waive qualifications resulted in his separation from Federal service and a concomitant loss of pay and thus was a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix), i.e., a decision concerning pay or benefits. Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, however, the appellant here was not separated. Although he was reassigned after his position was listed as surplus, he apparently suffered no loss of pay or benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that his lack of certification as a mineral examiner had an adverse impact on his applications for vacancies after his position was declared surplus. However, he has presented no evidence that his lack of certification was the basis for his nonselection....</p>
