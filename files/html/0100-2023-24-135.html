<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-131"><span class="space">e.</span> Whistleblower Reprisal Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Shaller v. United States</span>, 58 Fed. Appx. 464, 466-68 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), neither the Tucker Act nor the APA provided a basis for monetary recovery by a VA physician who asserted a claim based on whistleblowing reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> whether the Court of Federal Claims correctly dismissed Dr. Shaller's claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for which relief may be granted. <span class="Italic">Ledford v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 297 F.3d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Dr. Shaller asserts that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to hear his case under various provisions of (1) the APA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.;</span> (2) 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462 (2000); (3) the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491 (2000); and (4) the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346 (2000). He further submits that the Court of Federal Claims may hear his case as a matter of public policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Dr. Shaller contends that there is jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims for his claims under the Tucker Act. The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491, confers jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims to "render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). Therefore, the Tucker Act is only a jurisdictional statute; it does not, by itself, create a substantive right enforceable against the United States for money damages. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed.2d 114 (1976). In essence, in order to bring suit under the Tucker Act, the plaintiff must "assert a claim under a separate money-mandating constitutional provision, statute, or regulation, the violation of which supports a claim for damages against the United States." <span class="Italic">James v. Caldera,</span> 159 F.3d 573, 580 (Fed. Cir. 1998). A money-mandating statute is one that "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained." <span class="Italic">Khan v. United States,</span> 201 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 400).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Little Tucker Act confers jurisdiction to the district courts and the Court of Federal Claims over civil actions, not exceeding $10,000, founded upon the Constitution or an Act of Congress, a regulation, or a contract with the United States. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(a)(2). Like the Tucker Act, this statute is only jurisdictional and the party asserting such a claim must assert a separate money-mandating statute. <span class="Italic">Litzenberger v. United States,</span> 89 F.3d 818, 820 (Fed. Cir. 1996). In this case, to the extent Dr. Shaller could plead a separate money-mandating statute on which to seek relief, he is precluded from relying on the Little Tucker Act as a jurisdictional basis because his monetary claim is for $750,000, and, thus, this statute does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Dr. Shaller asserts that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction to hear his suit under the APA, specifically 5 U.S.C, &#x00A7; 702. Section 702 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof. An action in a court of the United States seeking relief <span class="Italic">other than money damages</span> and stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This statute expressly precludes actions seeking monetary damages. In addition, &#x00A7; 702 is not a jurisdictional statute and, as such, does not confer jurisdiction on the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">Crocker v. United States</span>, 37 Fed. Cl. 191, 197 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 125 F.3d 1475 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("The Court of Federal Claims does not have general federal question jurisdiction, however, and it is well established that the APA is not an independent basis for this or any other court to exercise jurisdiction over claims for money."). Therefore, Dr. Shaller may not rely on the APA as a statute on which to base jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the Court of Federal Claims did not have jurisdiction to hear Dr. Shallers' claims, the court did acknowledge that there was jurisdiction, under the APA, in the district court. A decision by the Court of Federal Claims concerning whether to transfer a claim to another court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1631 (2000) is discretionary and is reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See, LeBlanc v. United States</span>, 50 F.3d 1025, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, the Court of Federal Claims declined to transfer the case back to the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1631 because: (1) neither party requested such a transfer; (2) Dr. Shaller had already brought eight separate, unsuccessful suits before the district court on these issues; and (3) Dr. Shaller declined the option during the eighth lawsuit to keep the case in district court. Based on these factors, we do not find that the Court of Federal Claims abused its discretion when it declined to transfer the case back to the district court under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1631.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, even though "plaintiffs complaint appears to be convoluted, if not somewhat contradictory," the Court of Federal Claims, pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, liberally construed Dr. Shaller's complaint as relying on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462[1] for his cause of action as well as the basis for jurisdiction. In any event, Dr. Shaller's reliance on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7462 fails. With respect to jurisdiction, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 is not a money-mandating statute because it does not expressly or by implication, mention that a party is entitled to compensation for damages. <span class="Italic">Testan,</span> 424 U.S. at 399-400. Thus, Dr. Shaller may not rely on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 as a money-mandating statute in order to bring a claim under the Tucker Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;On May 7, 1991, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4101-4618 were renumbered and recodified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Section 41110, in particular, relates to the disciplinary, and grievance procedures of the VHA personnel. The events giving rise to plaintiff's claims occurred between March 1988 and January 1991, prior to Congress' amendment and recodification of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. To that end, the Court of Federal claims applied the prior version of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for asserting a cause of action under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 (1991), the Court of Federal Claims did not err when it ruled that Dr. Shaller's back pay claim under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596 (2000) was statutorily precluded from judicial review in that court by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. In support of this <span id="Page_5361"></span>holding, the Court of Federal Claims relied upon <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, that such a claim is statutorily precluded. Dr. Khan was a VA physician who, like Dr. Shaller, was appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(l) and who, like Dr. Shaller, filed a claim against the agency for back pay and reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Khan</span>, 201 F.3d at 1379. This Court held that the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA") does not apply to physicians appointed under section 4104(1). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381-82. We further held that as such a physician, Dr. Khan had an exclusive grievance procedure under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7463. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382. Moreover, under the mandate of <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988), Dr. Khan could not bring his claims in the Court of Federal Claims<span class="Italic">. Khan,</span> 201 F.3d at 1381-82. In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, the Supreme Court held that the "deliberate exclusion of employees in respondent's service category from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action of the sort at issue here prevents respondent from seeking review in the Claims Court under the Back Pay Act." 484 U.S. at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dr. Shaller, like Dr. Khan, was a VA medical doctor appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(1). In determining that Dr. Shaller had a similar exclusive remedy, the Court of Federal Claims stated that "[a]lthough Dr. Shaller, unlike Dr. Khan, is covered under the earlier provisions, for purposes of the controlling legal issues involved in these two cases, the grievance procedures set forth in section 4110 do not differ in any substantive manner from those set forth in sections 7462 and 7463." We agree that because the grievance procedures set forth in sections 7462 (covering major adverse actions involving questions of professional conduct or competence) and 7463 (covering other major adverse actions) are similar, the Court of Federal Claims did not err in extending Khan to claims under section 7462. To that end, Dr. Shaller is precluded from any appeal to the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act or from the agency to the Board under the CSRA for that matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Tucker Act was not discussed by the court, direct resort to district court in whistleblower cases, that is, bypassing the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, was impermissible in <span class="Italic">Hendrix v. Snow,</span> 170 Fed. Appx. 68, 78-79 (11th Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hendrix argues that the court erred in concluding that she did not exhaust her administrative remedies as to her WPA claims because she made a good-faith attempt to exhaust them by submitting a claim to the OSC. Hendrix also contends that, due to her previous filing of an EEO complaint, she reasonably believed that she could not seek review before the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA provides protection to federal employees against agency reprisal for whistleblowing activities, such as disclosing illegal conduct, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, or acts presenting substantial dangers to health and safety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). To the extent Hendrix's brief can be construed as arguing that the district court erred in dismissing her WPA claims based on its determination that the CSRA provides the exclusive remedy for those claims, the district court, in fact, correctly explained that the WPA was an amendment to, and, thus, a part of the CSRA, and it considered her WPA claims under the procedural framework of the CSRA, <span class="Italic">see Broughton v. Courtney,</span> 861 F.2d 639, 643 (11th Cir. 1988) (the CSRA provides the exclusive procedure for challenging federal personnel decisions). Indeed, although we have not previously directly addressed this issue, the D.C. Circuit has concluded that, "[u]nder no circumstances does the WPA grant the district court jurisdiction to entertain a whistleblower cause of action brought directly before it in the first instance." <span class="Italic">See Stella v. Mineta,</span> 284 F.3d 135, 142 (D.C. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the CSRA, after a federal employee alleging a WPA violation files her claim with the OSC, the OSC investigates and may petition the MSPB on the employee's behalf if the OSC finds a violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 1221. If the OSC finds no violation, the employee, herself, may seek review before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The decision of the MSPB then is appealable to the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. However...if the employee raises a "mixed case claim," that is, one alleging both WPA and Title VII claims, the employee may seek relief either by filing a complaint with the agency's EEO department, or by appealing directly to the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Hendrix failed to include in any of her EEO complaints what disclosures she made that she now contends were protected under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Willis v. Dep't of Agriculture,</span> 141 F.3d 1139, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (explaining as persuasive authority that an employee failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he failed to set forth the disclosures he believed were protected). Thus, to exhaust her administrative remedies, Hendrix was required to seek review of the OSC's decision before the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), 1221. Because the OSC issued a decision dismissing Hendrix's WPA claims, and because Hendrix did not seek review of this decision with the MSPB, the district court correctly determined that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kelliher v. Veneman,</span> 313 F.3d 1270, 1274 (11th Cir. 2002) (concluding that district court had jurisdiction to review a "mixed case claim" where the employee had exhausted his claims before the MSPB).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Ninth Circuit rejected a private cause of action under federal law for whistleblower reprisal, <span class="Italic">Rivera v. United States</span>, 924 F.2d 948, 952-54 (9th Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Whistleblower Protection Act</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Riveras argue that while they may not have been able to bring their FTCA claims at the time of Mary Rivera's harm, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 ("Act") retroactively authorizes suit on those claims. The district court held that even if the Act did change prior law to permit FTCA claims arising in the context of government employment, it would not apply retroactively. Without expressing any view about the retroactivity of the Act, we affirm the district court on the alternative ground that the Act does not authorize government employees to bring FTCA claims based on conduct for which redress is available under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Golden Nugget, Inc. v. American Stock Exchange, Inc</span>., 828 F.2d 586, 590 (9th Cir. 1987) (court of appeals may affirm district court on alternative legal basis adequately supported in record).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Riveras argue that the text, purpose, and legislative history of the Act indicate that Congress intended to make available additional remedies outside the CSRA, including FTCA claims, to federal employees who suffer reprisals for blowing the whistle on government waste and wrongdoing. For textual support, the Riveras rely on a section of the Act, codified at 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1222 (Supp. 1990), that reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in section 1221(i), nothing in this chapter or chapter 23 shall be construed to limit any right or remedy available under a provision of statute which is outside of both this chapter and chapter 23.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Section 1221(i) provides that the procedures governing the individual right of action created by the Act, set out in sections 1221(a) through (h), also apply in administrative appeals before the MSPB. 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1221(i) (Supp. 1990). Chapter 23 establishes the merit system principles governing federal personnel management. 5 U.S.C.A. Secs. 2301-05 (Supp. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that this provision admonishes courts against construing the CSRA "to limit any right or remedy available under" a statutory provision outside the CSRA. However, as we held above, at the time the Act came into effect, a suit under the FTCA was not an "available" remedy. The text of section 1222, standing alone, cannot support the Riveras' argument that the Act has done more than preserve existing rights and remedies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Riveras supplement their textual argument with an argument about the purpose behind the Act. They first cite section 2 of the Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The purpose of this Act is to strengthen and improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government by--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) mandating that employees should not suffer adverse consequences as a result of prohibited personnel practices; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2) establishing--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;that the primary role of the Office of Special Counsel is to protect employees, especially whistleblowers, from prohibited personnel practices;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;that the Office of Special Counsel shall act in the interests of employees who seek assistance from the Office of Special Counsel; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(C)&#x2003;that while disciplining those who commit prohibited personnel practices may be used as a means by which to help accomplish that goal, the protection of individuals who are the subject of prohibited personnel practices remains the paramount consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub.L. No. 101-12, Sec. 2, 103 Stat. 16, 16 (1989). The Riveras also point to legislative history emphasizing that Congress sought "to eliminate the inadequacy of current whistleblower protection policy." 135 Cong. Rec. H754 (daily ed. March 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. Hoyer); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 135 Cong. Rec. S2804-05 (daily ed. March 16, 1989) (statement of Sen. Adams) (criticizing current system, particularly Office of Special Counsel).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the above sources indicate, there is no question that Congress was dissatisfied with whistleblower protection policy. However, in attempting to correct the faults in that policy, Congress focused on the procedures established by the CSRA. A Joint Explanatory Statement, issued in lieu of a House-Senate conference report on the heavily negotiated Act, explains that the Act "seeks to eliminate two types of impediments" to redress for whistleblowers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One category of impediments is a string of restrictive Merit Systems Protection Board and federal court decisions. Specific provisions of the bill modify or overturn inappropriate administrative or judicial determinations and make it more likely that whistleblowers and other victims of prohibited personnel practices will win their cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The second category of impediments are [sic] due to the policies of the Office of Special Counsel and stem from the Special Counsel's view of its role. The clear intent of the [CSRA] was that the Special <span id="Page_5362"></span>Counsel should protect and defend the rights of employees who were the victims of prohibited personnel practices.... However, the Special Counsel's view of the role of the Office--protecting the merit system--can and has led to instances in which the Special Counsel has acted to the actual detriment of employees seeking help from that Office....&#8197;Unless employees have confidence that they will not be hurt by going to the Special Counsel--that the Special Counsel is a safe haven--the Office can never be as effective as Congress intends in protecting victims of prohibited personnel practices.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. S2782-83 (daily ed. March 16, 1989) (Joint Explanatory Statement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act attacks the latter category of impediments by, for example, more extensively detailing the duties and responsibilities of the OSC to federal employees, 5 U.S.C.A. Secs. 1211-1219 (Supp.1990); providing whistleblowers with increased confidentiality, 5 U.S.C.A. Secs. 1212(g) &#x0026; 1213(h) (Supp. 1990); granting whistleblowers an individual right of action to pursue a claim before the MSPB and obtain judicial review of adverse decisions, 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1221 (Supp. 1990); and authorizing the award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs to whistleblowers who prevail on their claims, 5 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1221(g) (Supp. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Riveras argue that the first category of impediments described in the Joint Explanatory Statement includes cases such as <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, <span class="Italic">Kotarski</span>, and <span class="Italic">Lehman</span>, which emphasize the exclusivity of the remedies offered by the CSRA. In other words, they contend that section 1222 is a "specific provision" of the Act that overturns "inappropriate...judicial determinations" and authorizes suit under the FTCA on their claims. However, the Joint Explanatory Statement itself, upon which the Riveras rely, belies this interpretation. It instructs: "Section 1222 is not intended to create a cause of action where none otherwise exists or to reverse any court decision." 135 Cong. Rec. S2784 (daily ed. March 16, 1989). It is difficult to imagine a clearer statement of legislative intent on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One more piece of legislative history contradicts the Riveras' reading of the Act. The bill originally introduced in the House, H.R. 25, contained a section entitled "NON-EXTINGUISHMENT OF ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES," which provided that the Act should not be construed to extinguish or lessen rights or remedies available under, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the FTCA. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. 25, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., Sec. 10, <span class="Italic">reported in</span> H.R. Rep. No. 274, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., at 13 (1987). As the House Report explained, this section provided that "any right or remedy...under the Federal Torts [sic] Claims Act...is not extinguished by the specific statutory provisions covering prohibited personnel practices." H.R. Rep. No. 274, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., at 40 (1987). The initial Senate bill, S. 508, included no such reference to the FTCA, and the House provision completely disappeared in the ensuing negotiations over the compromise text of the Act. Thus, the issue of what effect the Act would have on FTCA claims was before Congress, and Congress chose to include only the general phrasing of section 1222, "not intend[ing] to create a cause of action where none otherwise exists or to reverse any court decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lacking textual support and facing contrary authority in the legislative history, the Riveras' argument must fail. The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 increases protections for whistleblowers, but it does so within the context of the CSRA. The Act does not authorize government employees to bring FTCA claims arising out of conduct addressed by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A tort claim, a False Claim Act case, and a cause of action based on the federal question jurisdictional statute, 28 USC 1331, were all denied as to a whistleblower, whose exclusive basis for relief was through the Reform Act provisions designed to protect whistleblowers. <span class="Italic">Daly v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 741 F. Supp. 202 (D. Col. 1990). A court suggested the possibility that an EEO case with a whistleblowing claim might be proper in a district court, though the discussion of administrative exhaustion was lacking in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Ulmer</span> (<a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20220204796">1:21-cv-03128</a> (UNA) D.D.C. 2022) ("Moreover, in any circumstance, the MSPB's determination of a WPA claim is appealable exclusively to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Weber</span>, 209 F.3d at 758 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703). While a plaintiff may plausibly bring a 'mixed case' in this District--i.e., involving the WPA in combination with claims under other viable federal anti-discrimination employment statutes--plaintiff has filed a 'pure' WPA case, therefore depriving this court of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gammill v. Dep't of Education</span>, 989 F. Supp.2d 118, 121-22 (D.D.C. 2013) (collecting cases and citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1))."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Zachariasiewicz v. DOJ</span>, 48 F.4th 237 (4th Cir. 2022) (Judge Diaz dissenting) (district court lacked jurisdiction over whistleblower claim joined with an EEO claim coming from an appeal to MSPB from a constructive demotion).</p>
