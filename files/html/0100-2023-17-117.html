<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-118"><span class="space">C.</span> DISCRIMINATION DEFENSES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board treats an appeal from a RIF as a mixed case if the appellant alleges that the RIF, or a component of the RIF, e.g., assessment of assignment rights, discriminated against the appellant, e.g., on a basis prohibited by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act (race, religion, gender) or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">George v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 71, 78-79 (1997). To treat the discrimination defense, the Board must have jurisdiction over the RIF. 5 USC 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">McDonald v. VA</span>, 86 MSPR 539, 544 &#x00B6; 15 (2000). If a RIF is challenged as discriminatory, the appellant must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; then the agency is required to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the RIF. The burden then shifts back to the appellant to show that the asserted reason is pretextual. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHUD</span>, 6 MSPR 177, 178-79, 6 MSPB 157 (1981) (appellant was not assigned to another position because she lacked the necessary qualifications, meaning that she did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 408, 412-14 (1997) (considering, as to a RIF, allegations of disparate treatment relative to the favored treatment of other individuals in the appellant's competitive level); <span class="Italic">Moran v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 77, 86 (1994) (appellant did not present evidence of discrimination; further, the agency demonstrated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the RIF and the appellant did not show that the agency's rationale was pretextual).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant does not demonstrate the qualifications for a position sought during a RIF, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is not demonstrated. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 535, 537-38 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Foss v. Thompson</span>, 242 F.3d 1131, 1135-37 (9th Cir. 2001) (Dissenting Opinion of Judge Kleinfield analyzing sexually discriminatory disparate impact of nursing degree requirement of position sought through assignment rights). In <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the appellant alleged that during a RIF she was subjected to racial discrimination because, unlike others, qualification requirements were not waived for her as to a job she sought through assignment. The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), analysis was adopted concerning burden of proof for a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. In her appeal, the evidence demonstrated that although the agency waived qualification requirements for recruitment of experienced individuals to fill higher-level positions, it did not waive those requirements as to personnel filling GS-7 positions; there was no showing that the agency sought to fill the position the appellant sought through assignment with applicants with qualifications similar to hers, meaning that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was not established. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DHUD</span>, 6 MSPR 177, 179-80, 6 MSPB 157 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Foland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 92, 96-99 (1997) (analysis of the agency's treatment of a vacant position sought by a disabled employee during a RIF); <span class="Italic">Kitching v. DHHS</span>, 20 MSPR 579, 581-82 (1984) (also applying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> formulation to a RIF challenged as discriminatory); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 11, 14 (1982) (appellant did not show as pretext the agency demonstration that RIF was not personal to him or that bumping rights were satisfied); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Green v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 6 MSPR 102, 105, 6 MSPB 98 (1981) (RIF was a reprisal for the filing of grievances). [Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-002.html#sec12-3">Procedures in Mixed Cases</a>" for discrimination defenses.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abakan v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 98 MSPR 662, 665-66 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2005), outlined the AJ's responsibilities when discrimination is asserted as a RIF defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the agency has the burden to prove by preponderant evidence that it properly invoked and implemented the pertinent regulations during a RIF.<span class="Italic"> See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 195, 201&#8209;02 (1980). The agency may establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case on the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of its decision by coming forward with evidence showing a RIF was undertaken for one of the approved reasons; once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence, but not the burden of persuasion, shifts to the employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As part of its overall burden, the agency must also show that it afforded the appellant the proper assignment rights during the RIF. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 18 (1999). This is a substantive right, not merely a procedural requirement. <span class="Italic">See Losure</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 201 n.5. In particular, the agency is responsible for assuring that the actions taken in a RIF are done uniformly and consistently. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 351.201(b), 351.201(c). The Board has found that an affirmative defense of discrimination properly goes to the issue of the appellant's entitlements under the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">George v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 71, 78 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant does not challenge the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF in general. Instead, his sole contention below, and on PFR, is that the agency unfairly failed to offer him reassignment to a vacant GS-5 position of Quality Assurance Specialist, instead of the Laborer position to which he was demoted. He contends, in part, that the agency's actions were improper because it treated a similarly-situated Caucasian employee more favorably during the RIF. The Board has held that a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is not required to plead the issue of discrimination with the precision of an attorney in a judicial proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Turner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 7 (2003). Here, the appellant's submissions indicate that he was attempting to make and support claims of race and national origin discrimination as the basis of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, generally, an appellant is deemed to have abandoned a discrimination claim if it is not included in the list of issues in a prehearing conference summary, or status conference summary, and the party was afforded an opportunity to object to the conference summary. <span class="Italic">See Clarke v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 435, 442 (1997). In the absence of a summary, we cannot conclude that the AJ limited the issues in this way. Therefore, we find the appellant was not properly put on notice that his discrimination claims would not be considered, and he cannot be deemed to have abandoned his discrimination claims. In fact, the appellant's argument on PFR that the AJ failed to consider the legitimacy of Harris' RIF assignment suggests that the appellant never abandoned his discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board has held that when an appellant timely raises a claim of discrimination, the AJ must apprise him of the relevant burden and elements of proof. <span class="Italic">Yovan v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 264, &#x00B6; 5 (2000); <span class="Italic">Clarke,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 442. Here, the record does not show <span id="Page_3125"></span>that the appellant was ever properly informed of his burden and the elements of proof on his discrimination claims. Accordingly, this appeal must be remanded to the regional office for further development of the record and adjudication of these issues. <span class="Italic">See Coleman v. Department of Energy,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 251, &#x00B6; 6 (1999); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Army,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 245, &#x00B6; 6 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is proved by membership in a protected group, evidence that the appellant was the only protected group member affected by the RIF, and evidence that no others suffered as severely with respect to overall employment benefits in the RIF process. If the agency demonstrates a nondiscriminatory reason for the RIF, the appellant must then demonstrate that a connection existed between the appellant's membership in the protected group and the RIF to prove that the nondiscriminatory reason offered was a sham. <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 21 MSPR 153, 158 (1984). The Board adopted an EEOC finding that the appellant was discriminated against on the basis of disability when the agency abolished his position during a RIF. <span class="Italic">Click v. DHHS</span>, 20 MSPR 57, 58 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Click v. DHHS</span>, EEOC No. 03820132 (1983) (Commission found that an agency's failure to convert an excepted service to a competitive service appointment was discriminatory and that evidence demonstrated harassment of the employee because of a disability). The Board rejected the contention that an agency must apply affirmative action goals to attain a more balanced work force during its consideration of what positions to eliminate by RIF. <span class="Italic">Motley v. TVA</span>, 43 MSPR 1, 2 (1989) (relying on <span class="Italic">Liao v. TVA</span>, 867 F.2d 1366 (11th Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may require a demonstration of intentional discrimination, <span class="Italic">Kline v. TVA</span>, 46 MSPR 193, 200-01 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency's action was based upon discrimination due to his race (black), and upon reprisal for his filing of EEO complaints. Although an agency's action is sustained, it must be reversed if one of these prohibited personnel practices is proven. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B). The appellant bears the burden of proving these claims by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army,</span> 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Fenn v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 362 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Fenn</span>, at 366-67, an appellant, in order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of race discrimination based on disparate treatment, must show that: (1) He is a member of a protected group; (2) he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the particular protected group; and (3) he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. An appellant is also required to show that the difference in treatment was based on an intent to discriminate. Intent may be shown by circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge found that the appellant did set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, since he was black, Mr. Shaffer was white, and the agency erred in not including both in the same competitive level. We have found, however, that the agency did not err in its competitive level determination. The parties stipulated that there were legitimate management reasons for conducting the RIF. Moreover, even had there been error in defining the competitive level, there is no evidence that racial discrimination was the intent behind the error. <span class="Italic">See Fenn,</span> at 367 (even though the agency's reasons may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders, the relevant question for the Board is whether the stated reasons are a pretext for discrimination). There is no evidence that race was a factor in Mr. Bramblett's apparently good-faith competitive level decision. Therefore, even had the appellant set forth a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, we find that the agency articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its different treatment of the appellant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may examine something less than intentional discrimination, as it explained regarding a disparate impact and disparate treatment affirmative defense in the RIF appeal of <span class="Italic">Stern v. FTC</span>, 46 MSPR 328, 332-40 (1990), critiquing statistical analysis as a means of proving discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Disparate Impact</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that her situation meets the test for establishing disparate impact set forth in <span class="Italic">Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (1989), a Title VII action brought by nonwhite cannery workers who asserted that their employers' hiring and promotion practices had denied them employment in noncannery (i.e., skilled) jobs on the basis of race. In <span class="Italic">Wards Cove</span>, the Court explained that under a "disparate impact" theory, a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed to violate Title VII without the evidence of an employer's subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a disparate treatment case<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2119.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court explained that to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, an employee must identify the specific employment practice that is challenged as responsible for the statistical disparities and show that the application of this particular practice created the disparate impact<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2124-25. If the employee establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the employer must offer a business justification for its use of the practices. In this phase, the employer carries the burden of producing evidence. The dispositive issue is whether a challenged practice significantly serves the legitimate employment goals of the employer. If the employer meets this burden of production, the employee may still establish disparate impact by showing the availability of alternative practices that achieve the same business ends with less impact on the protected group<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2125-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that she established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate impact by presenting evidence showing a significant disparate impact on members of the following protected groups: women, older employees, and older women. She asserts that the disparity resulted from the facially neutral employment practices of focusing on part-time employees in the RIF and exempting junior attorneys (GS-11 and GS-12) from the RIF. The agency responds that no such employment practices existed, asserting that no agency or BCP guidelines instruct managers to first consider separating part-time employees or to exempt newly-hired attorneys from RIFs. Rather, it characterizes the determination of who to separate pursuant to the RIF as an "<span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the agency's assertion that its "<span class="Italic">ad hoc</span>" decisions concerning who to separate during a RIF cannot be considered to be employment practices for purposes of a disparate treatment analysis. The Supreme Court has held that subjective or discretionary employment practices may be analyzed under the disparate impact approach in appropriate cases<span class="Italic">. See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and Trust</span>, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 2786-87 (1988). We note, however, that the Court also placed a burden on the employee to isolate and identify the specific employment practice and to offer sufficient statistical evidence to prove that the practice in question, in this case the appellant's separation, was because of her membership in a protected group<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2788-89. The employer is then free to counter with evidence that the employee's statistical evidence is unreliable<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 2789-99.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming that the appellant has shown that both of the agency decisions she identified constituted facially neutral employment practices,[3] she must still show that the decisions caused her separation based on her membership in a protected group. We conclude that the appellant has failed to make this showing and thus has not established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under a disparate impact analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As the administrative judge found and we reiterate in this opinion and order, part-time workers are not a protected group. Thus, the appellant's attempt to show that the agency's decision to target part-time workers for separation constituted an employment practice must focus on the connection between part-time status, gender, and age. In this regard, we note that the record does not show that the appellant's part-time status was due to her sex or age. Rather, it suggests that it resulted from her alleged handicap, an issue not before us. Therefore, although it may be that most part-time workers are female and over 40, we find the appellant's attempt to assert that she was discriminated against as a member of these protected classes questionable since her part-time status apparently did not result from her membership in those classes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To begin with, we note that throughout her petition, the appellant, in effect, has attempted to create a protected class of part-time employees. As the administrative judge found, part-time employees are not entitled to greater rights than those accorded by the laws and regulations governing RIFs<span class="Italic">. See Drucker</span>, 14 MSPR at 441. Moreover, we note that there is no evidence, and indeed no assertion, that the appellant's--or in general the older women's--part-time status resulted from any employment practice of the agency. Thus, we will not further consider her assertions that the agency discriminated against her as a part-time employee. To the extent that the appellant is asserting that the agency's employment practices had a disparate impact on women and employees over 40, we will consider her arguments separately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in rejecting her statistical proof. Specifically, she asserts that he erred in discounting the statistics on the basis that Dr. Roth had created a hybrid protected group of women over 40. To support her assertion, the appellant characterizes the initial decision as finding that employment practices that have a disparate impact on members of two statutorily protected groups, i.e. women and employees over 40, are permissible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not find that it is acceptable to discriminate against older women; rather, he simply found that combining the statistics regarding older employees and women led to a skewed result and one that was insufficient to establish discrimination. In any event, we find it unnecessary to address the appellant's argument in this regard. Even if it would be appropriate to combine the two groups for purposes of statistical analysis, as set forth below, we find that the resulting small sample size is insufficient to establish disparate impact in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that she showed disparate impact separately against women and employees over 40 separately is also without merit. In this regard, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge's reliance on agency-wide statistics to support his finding that the RIF had no disparate impact on these protected classes was inappropriate. She <span id="Page_3126"></span>contends that the administrative judge should have analyzed the issue on the basis of BCP statistics because the decision to separate her was made at the bureau level. Similarly, she asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the small sample size that would result from looking only at BCP would be insufficient to show disparate impact.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To begin with, if agency-wide statistics are considered, the appellant has failed to sustain her burden of proving disparate impact. As the administrative judge found, before the RIF the agency consisted of 50.8% women and 50.2% employees over 40. Of the agency employees separated by RIF, 43.3% were women and 56.7% were over 40. Thus, the percentage of women separated, far from showing a disparate impact, actually showed that women were "favored" during the RIF. The percentages do show that employees over 40 were separated at a slightly higher rate than their representation in the work force. However, the Board has found in a disparate treatment case that statistics showing a much greater effect on employees over 40 are insufficient to show discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Decker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 134-35 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the BCP statistics, rather than the agency-wide statistics, are considered, the RIF had a greater impact on women and employees over 40. As the administrative judge also found, before the RIF BCP consisted of 57.2% women and 47.1% employees over 40. Of the BCP employees separated by the RIF, 83.3% were women and 66.7% were over 40. However, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the resulting sample size would be too small to support a finding of disparate impact.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Because of this, we find it unnecessary to address the appellant's assertion that the administrative judge erred in finding Dr. Roth's statistics invalid because they did not consider the impact of the RIF regulations. We note, however, that the RIF regulations establish a somewhat mechanical approach that takes away some agency discretion in determining the conduct of a RIF, they do not allow for equal employment opportunity factors to be considered, and they require the placement of part-time positions in separate competitive levels<span class="Italic">. See Drucker v. Department of the Interior</span>, 14 MSPR 436, 439 (1983); 5 CFR 351.403(b)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant has cited several cases to support her assertion that the sample size was not too small. We do not find these cases dispositive, however. In <span class="Italic">Boykin v. Georgia-Pacific Corporation</span>, 706 F.2d 1384 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">rehearing denied</span>, 714 F.2d 137 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 465 U.S. 1006 (1984), a Title VII class action to challenge alleged racial discrimination in the initial assignment and promotion of blacks, the numbers involved were much larger than in the present case. The court considered the assignment of 761 employees and the promotion of 335 non-probationary employees<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1391. In <span class="Italic">Fudge v. City of Providence Fire Department</span>, 766 F.2d 650 (1st Cir. 1985), the court found that the plaintiff's proof, which consisted solely of the different rates of acceptance for 24 black applicants and 224 white applicants, was an insufficient basis for finding disparate impact<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 657. Finally, we note that although <span class="Italic">Schmid v. Frosch</span>, 680 F.2d 248 (D.C. Cir. 1982), involved smaller numbers, the court's conclusion was only that the district court inappropriately granted summary judgment because the plaintiff's statistical and other evidence sufficed to make out a genuine issue of material fact warranting further consideration. Indeed, it found that the district court correctly found that small samples are of lesser value than large samples and noted that the mathematical computations did not take competence and qualifications into consideration<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 249-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that the focus in determining whether the sample is sufficient should not be the number of employees in BCP before the RIF, that is 208, but the number of employees separated by RIF, i.e., 6<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corporation</span>, 823 F.2d 937, 943 (6th Cir. 1987) (departure of only 17 people as basis for statistical argument is suspect because of small sample size); <span class="Italic">Fuller v. U.S. Department of Justice</span>, 4 MSPR 497, 499 (1981). With such a small sample, the substitution of a single employee of a different sex and age for one of those separated by the RIF dramatically affects the percentage of those separated relative to their representation in the workforce of the BCP. In addition, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Decker</span> that it could not draw any probative inference of age discrimination from statistics showing that the employees selected for RIF were all in the protected group. Moreover, as the administrative judge correctly found, because more females than males held part-time positions, which constituted five of the six abolished positions, a comparison of statistics is insufficient to show a discriminatory impact on women<span class="Italic">. See Drucker</span>, 14 MSPR at 441.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Even where, standing alone, statistics are not too small to be of significance, their usefulness nonetheless depends on the surrounding circumstances<span class="Italic">. Teamsters v. U.S.</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 340 (1977). Under the circumstances of this case, we find the statistics not sufficiently probative to constitute a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for reasons discussed above. In addition, because, as discussed <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the agency offered the appellant employment in a part-time status if she would work 32 rather than 24 hours a week, it is not clear that statistics concerning part-time workers in general, without consideration of their work schedules, are the most relevant. Moreover, we note that the retention registers indicate that four other part-time attorneys, all of whom apparently are women, were retained in the RIF. To the extent that attorneys in BCP, rather than BCP employees in general, may represent the qualified workforce competing for retention, <span class="Italic">see Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio</span>, 109 S. Ct. 2115, 2121-22 (1989), an issue not addressed by the appellant, the statistics do not support a claim of sex discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Drucker</span> because the agency did not target part-time positions for elimination in that case. The appellant, however, is again attempting to create a protected class out of part-time employees. Although, as the appellant points out, the agency in <span class="Italic">Drucker</span> abolished temporary positions before part-time positions, she has not shown that any temporary positions existed in BCP. Indeed, the facts in <span class="Italic">Drucker</span> indicate that the agency abolished the part-time positions before the full-time positions. The appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Drucker</span> as a similar case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Disparate Treatment</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof of discrimination under the disparate treatment theory requires evidence of the employer's subjective intent to discriminate<span class="Italic">. Wards Cove</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 2119. In order to establish a claim, the appellant first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the initial decision incorrectly described her burden to demonstrate a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under <span class="Italic">Decker</span>. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Decker</span>, however, the administrative judge found that the appellant must show that she is a member of a protected group, that she was adversely affected by an agency action, and that credible evidence supports an inference with substantial or reasonable probability that her protected characteristic was the determining factor in the challenged action<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Decker</span>, 40 MSPR at 132.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;On the last point in connection with her sex discrimination claim, the appellant must show that there was a causal connection between her sex and the agency's action<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Clardy v. Veterans Administration</span>, 13 MSPR 598, 602 (1982). To the extent that the administrative judge misstated this standard, we find that it did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights<span class="Italic">. See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The appellant cites statements by agency officials that she asserts showed a desire to retain younger attorneys and to separate part-time employees, evidence that younger employees were retained and hired, and replaced her after the RIF. The statements, however, are insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment. The appellant asserts that one agency official, Sylvia Miller, commented that younger attorneys were exempted from the RIF because they were the "lifeblood for the agency's new ideas." Ms. Miller's affidavit, however, reveals that she actually said that the BCP decided not to abolish the positions of the GS-11 and GS-12 attorneys because the "recent hires" were the lifeblood for the agency's new ideas. Although the appellant asserts that most GS-11 and GS-12 attorneys were under 40, she has failed to show how such a statement, which does not even refer to age, shows an intent to discriminate against the protected class. <span class="Italic">See</span>, e.g., <span class="Italic">Van Patten-Steiger v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 29 MSPR 324, 328-29 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant has not shown that Ms. Miller's statement with respect to part-time employees that "they've made their choice, we've made ours," and evidence that officials referred to part-time employees as "part-time women" shows sex discrimination. Although the appellant does not identify when Ms. Miller's statement was made, the agency asserts that it occurred in 1984. A statement so far removed in time is insufficient to show discriminatory intent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Worrell v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 26 MSPR 361, 364 (1985). In any event, Ms. Miller's statement as reported does not even refer to women. As previously stated, part-time employees are not a protected class.[8] Moreover, the agency officials' reference to "part-time women" is not sufficient to show an intent to discriminate. Rather, it could simply reflect the undisputed fact, which indeed is the basis for the appellant's sex discrimination claim, that most part-time employees are women.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;On this point, the appellant implies that the agency targeted part-time employees for separation because they are mostly women and over 40. For the reasons discussed in our analysis of the appellant's statistics concerning her disparate impact argument, we <span id="Page_3127"></span>find that she has similarly failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on this basis under the disparate treatment theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant cites testimony by Ms. Miller that she believed that the BCP's RIF presented serious equal employment opportunity problems. The appellant, however, has not explained how this shows any intent by the agency to discriminate. Indeed, in response to a congressional inquiry concerning the same issue, the agency provided a detailed explanation of its actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that she established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case by showing that younger employees were retained and hired, and replaced her after the RIF. The appellant, however, has not shown that the agency hired any part-time GM-14 attorney to replace her. Indeed, as previously stated, the record shows that the other attorney in her competitive level, who was under 40, was also separated by RIF. Moreover, the appellant has failed to show that she was entitled to any of the retained positions, and the agency's actions after the RIF are insufficient to establish discrimination<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Vincent v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 41 MSPR 637, 640-41 (1989). In any event, we note that the agency in fact offered the appellant a position as a full-time or part-time (32 hours a week) attorney after the RIF. Thus, her arguments concerning the agency's hiring of full-time attorneys after the RIF are without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant did not establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under the disparate treatment theory, we find it unnecessary to consider her assertions that the agency's explanations were pretext<span class="Italic">. See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Decker</span>, 40 MSPR at 135.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Work force statistics were discounted in <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 131-35 (1989), analyzing a disparate treatment age discrimination defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear in the initial decision whether the administrative judge analyzed the appellants' affirmative defense of age discrimination as a claim of disparate impact or disparate treatment. The Board and the federal courts have generally considered age discrimination complaints as falling within disparate treatment analysis because the challenge is most often to the employer's motive for taking a discrete, particular employment-based action, rather than to broad policies or practices having equal application to all employees, where disparate impact analysis applies.[9] Here, the appellants' age discrimination allegation is limited to the agency's decision to eliminate their specific positions and to reassign them to lower graded positions, rather than to any general agency personnel policies affecting all employees falling within the age protected class.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering age discrimination claims under disparate treatment analysis in Title V cases, the Board has been guided by the tripartite order and allocation of proof standard first established under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> <span class="Italic">v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973)<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Mahurin v. Department of Air Force,</span> 4 MSPR at 304-05; <span class="Italic">Kitching v. Department of Health and Human Service,</span> 20 M.S. P.R. 579, 581-2 (1984). Under this standard, the putative discriminatee must first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination. Only if a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established does the burden of production shift to the agency to articulate a non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC &#x00A7; 621 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> in a reduction-in-force case, an employee must show (a) coverage under the Act, (b) an unfavorable employment action, and (c) that the employee's age was the determinative factor in the agency's challenged action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ayala v. Mayfair Molded Products Co.,</span> 831 F.2d 1314, 1318-19 (7th Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Cuddy v. Carmen,</span> 694 F.2d 853, 857 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Williams v. General Motors Corp.</span>, 656 F.2d 120, 129 (5th Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 455 U.S. 943, 102 S. Ct. 1439, 71 L. Ed.2d 655 (1982). Under this standard, the Board weighs all credible evidence that in sum must support the inference with substantial or reasonable probability, as distinguished from a possibility, that the employee's age was the determining factor in the separation or demotion action. We now turn to the specific evidence offered to meet the appellants' burden of establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and we agree, that the appellants met their burden of showing they are within the age group protected by the Act (at least 40 years of age) and they have suffered an adverse employment action (demotion from positions for which they were qualified).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He further found that the appellants had satisfied the third requirement by the following statistical comparisons: (1) Nine employees were affected by the RIF and all were in the protected age group; and (2) immediately following the RIF, eight employees received agency awards, and of the eight, only one (who was between 40-44 years old) was in the protected age group. He found that the likelihood of the two events occurring by chance was about 1 in 36,000. According to the administrative judge, the agency's exhibit showing that 58% of the Tucson office employees were over 40 years old did not explain the "remarkable disparity" between employees in the protected age group who were affected by the RIF and the younger employees who received awards immediately after the RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also relied upon the unrebutted testimony of Appellant Berg that Director Robertson gave him the impression that she wanted him to retire by inquiring about his retirement plans and asking him why he had stayed so long in a "dead-end job." The administrative judge noted that, although the testimony would not evidence age discrimination <span class="Italic">per se</span>, he found that it could, when considered together with other evidence of discrimination and improprieties by the agency, demonstrate age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before discussing the probative value of appellants' statistical evidence, we first reject as contradictory the administrative judge's finding based upon Berg's testimony that lawful acts can be relied upon to demonstrate illegal age discrimination. Both the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-253 &#x00A7; 308(a)) and OPM guidelines authorize federal agencies considering a RIF to survey employees eligible for retirement as a means of using voluntary retirement to lower employee complements and thereby reduce the number of employees affected by the RIF action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d); FPM Chapter 351 (Interim), Subchapter 1-3 (urging planning and alternative actions to abate the adverse impact of a RIF); FPM Chapter 351, Appendix E (concerning agencies' authority to request approval by the Office of Personnel Management for early retirement in a RIF situation). Therefore, absent evidence that Robertson suggested Berg retire, her inquiries of Berg regarding <span class="Italic">his</span> retirement eligibility cannot properly be relied upon as "evidence" of her intent to later discriminate against Berg, because Robertson's questions do not show that she thought Berg should retire. <span class="Italic">Compare Russo v. Trifari, Krussman</span> <span class="Italic">&#x0026; Fishel, Inc.,</span> 837 F.2d 40, 43 (2nd Cir. 1988) (Department Manager's statement to over age 40 employee: "It's time you retired." establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the two categories of the appellants' statistical comparisons evidence, we first conclude that the performance award statistics are irrelevant to the agency's motive in selecting appellants' positions for elimination and in demoting appellants to lower graded positions. The affirmative age discrimination defense challenges the agency's RIF actions, not the agency's monetary performance award practices. Appellants seek to invalidate their demotions and return to their eliminated positions, not to obtain performance awards. Nor is there any contention or record evidence that appellants would have received monetary awards but for their demotion. There is no apparent relationship or cause and effect connection evidenced by these statistics between the agency's RIF selections and its later performance award selections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the administrative judge erred by relying upon performance award statistics we find to be devoid of relevance to the appellants' <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> burden of showing that the agency's RIF selection decision was not age neutral.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants' <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case thus rests solely upon the numerical percentages that all the employees selected for RIF were over age 40, and this percentage (100%) exceeded that of the total percentage of office employees over age 40 (58%). Appellants offered no other oral or documentary evidence, direct or circumstantial, supporting an inference that appellants' age was substantially or reasonably a factor in the agency's decision to include their positions in the RIF. <span class="Italic">Compare Cooper v. Asplundh Tree Expert</span> <span class="Italic">Co.,</span> 836 F.2d 1544, 1548 (10th Cir. 1988) (supervisor stated "people over 40 should be gotten rid of"); <span class="Italic">Mahurin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR at 305 (uncontroverted statements regarding appellant's age by superior). In these circumstances, we conclude that the appellants failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we caution that the statistical sample is small and such bases lack probative significance in drawing evidentiary conclusions. <span class="Italic">See Fink v. Western Electric Company</span>, 708 F.2d 909, 918 (4th Cir. 1983) (small numbers unreliable in making statistical evaluations). However, assuming a measurable numerical base, the appellants' statistical disparity between the group selected for RIF and the percentage of the agency's over-age-40 work force fails to show that particular employees outside the protected class but in the same comparative position as appellants were more favorably treated in the RIF selection decision. Absent a more narrowly defined statistical comparison between the appellants and any <span id="Page_3128"></span>younger employees also in overgraded positions who were not selected for RIF, the broader work force comparison does not shed any light on why the appellants, rather than younger employees, were selected for this particular RIF. <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Midland-Ross</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.,</span> 823 F.2d 937, 943 (6th Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact, then, that qualified over-age-40 employees are selected for RIF and demotion is not alone inherently suspect for "[t]here is no automatic presumption that every termination of an employee between the ages of 40 and 70 results in a violation of the [ADEA]." <span class="Italic">Locke v. Commercial Union Insurance Co.</span>, 676 F.2d 205, 206 (6th Cir. 1982). This is so because aging is a universal human process. By operation of this process, an agency's work force will steadily achieve the statutorily protected age category, absent unusually high turnover, particularly in higher graded positions where it is likely that a majority of incumbents will fall within the protected age group. <span class="Italic">Simpson v. Midland-Ross Corp.,</span> 823 F.2d at 941 n.3; <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.,</span> 554 F.2d 730, 736 (5th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Laugesen v. Anaconda Co.,</span> 510 F.2d 307, 312-13 n.4 (6th Cir. 1975)<span class="Italic">. See also McCorstin v. U.S. Steel</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.,</span> 621 F.2d 749, 754 (5th Cir. 1980). It follows from this situation that protected age employees are more likely than underage-40 employees to be selected for RIF from higher graded positions. Because this consequence can be explained naturally by operation of the aging process, we are unable to draw any probative inference of age discrimination from statistics showing that the employees selected for RIF were all in the protected group, or that the percentage of age protected employees in higher graded positions exceeded the total percentage of the agency's employees in the protected age group in all positions. <span class="Italic">See Pace v. Southern</span> <span class="Italic">Railway System,</span> 701 F.2d 1383, 1389 (11th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 464 U.S. 1018, 104 S. Ct. 549, 78 L. Ed.2d 724 (1983). Standing alone, these statistics are insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination of sufficient probability to require the agency to articulate legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its reduction-in-force decision. <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. B. Green &#x0026; Co., Inc.</span>, 836 F.2d 845, 848 (4th Cir. 1988). Accordingly, we conclude, contrary to the administrative judge, that the appellants failed to sustain their affirmative defense of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Drucker v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 14 MSPR 436, 440-41 (1983), determined that the appellants established, based on statistical and other evidence, a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination in a RIF, but the agency established a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the RIF: shortage of funds. The appellants did not demonstrate that the stated basis for the RIF was pretextual. Of the "disparate impact" analysis offered by appellants:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to demonstrate "disparate impact," an employee must show that some facially neutral employment practice has a substantially disproportionate impact on one group more than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. <span class="Italic">International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. U.S.,</span> 431 U.S. 324, 97 S. Ct. 1843, 52 L. Ed.2d 396 (1977). Unlike a "treatment" case, it is not necessary to show intent to discriminate. <span class="Italic">See Id. See also Grigg v. Duke Power Co.,</span> 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statistical evidence relied upon by the appellants showed that although female attorneys comprised approximately 25.1%, of the attorney workforce in OS, they constituted 57.2% of the attorneys terminated under the RIF. Additionally, the evidence reflected that while 221 (49.3%) of the total number of employees were females, females constituted 60.7% (31) of the total number of employees separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, while acknowledging that 12 of 13 part-time positions abolished were occupied by females, points out that 20 of the 51 employees separated by the RIF were men. The agency further relates that the two other groups of employees, temporary and full-time permanent, were divided equally between males and females separated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Statistical evidence is competent evidence which serves an important role in cases in which the existence of discrimination is in doubt. <span class="Italic">Teamsters, supra.</span> Although statistical proof, standing alone, without specific evidence of discrimination, may be used in certain instances to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, <span class="Italic">Hazelwood School Dist ct v. U.S.,</span> 433 U.S. 299, 307-308, 97 S. Ct. 2736, 2741-2742, 53 L. Ed.2d 768 (1977), the usefulness of such circumstantial evidence depends on all the surrounding circumstances. <span class="Italic">Teamsters</span>, 431 U.S. at 340, 97 S. Ct. at 1857.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After careful consideration of the statistical evidence presented, the Board finds that appellants have failed to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination on the basis of sex under an "impact" analysis. The agency's actions, contrary to appellants' contention, did not separate a disproportionate percentage of females. Moreover, because more females than males held part-time positions, a comparison serves to dilute any actual discriminatory impact against females. The statistics do not warrant a finding of discrimination, under the circumstances of this case, under either theory.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> analysis to a RIF claimed to discriminate on the basis of race, the Ninth Circuit remanded the plaintiff's claim in <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1993), back to district court for a trial when the government's justification for the underlying reorganization, fiscal necessity, was pretextual. Upon a showing of pretext, discriminatory motivation remained a question for the factfinder to answer. The court relied on the Supreme Court's analysis in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to claims of discrimination on the basis of disability, race, and sex discrimination in placement and reemployment rights during a RIF, the Board found no improprieties in <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 21, 27 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant did not show that the agency discriminated against her on the basis of handicap in effecting the RIF. The appellant's assertion that the agency was obligated to accommodate her handicap when it considered placement during the RIF is without merit. There is no evidence that the appellant could have been placed in any position during the RIF. She had no bump or retreat rights and no vacancies were available. No regulation entitles an employee subject to RIF separation to a permanent light-duty position regardless of his or her placement rights, and the appellant did not show that the agency retained any employees with lesser RIF rights than she in any capacity, including light-duty. Thus, the agency's obligation to consider an employee's handicap when placing individuals subject to RIF did not arise in the appellant's situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that the agency's rehiring decisions after the RIF constituted improper race and sex discrimination is not within the purview of this appeal. An allegation that the agency violated the appellant's reemployment rights is subject to the Board's jurisdiction if the employee asserts that another former employee with lower standing on the reemployment priority list was hired. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209. The appellant has not, however, referenced her reemployment priority rights, and she has not indicated that the one individual that she identifies specifically, a man who was rehired after the RIF, has lower retention standing than she. Further, the appellant received worker's compensation continuously from the date of the RIF until after her reemployment priority rights expired in September 1992. Thus, we find that she was unavailable for work during that interval.</p>
