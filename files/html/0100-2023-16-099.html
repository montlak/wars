<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-98"><span class="space">4.</span> Training</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shuman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 620, 630-32 n.15 (1984), considered the defense that the employee received insufficient training. A collective bargaining agreement provided that an employee could raise lack of necessary training as a defense to an unacceptable performance action. The Board determined that the negotiated agreement did not impose additional requirements on the agency that the Board was required to enforce. As to the defense, the Board concluded that an employee who is not given adequate instructions regarding the manner she is to perform her duties was not provided with an adequate opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Shuman</span> was remanded for development of further evidence concerning appellant's training. However, no, although at note 15 of the decision the Board said, "We are not holding that an agency is required to provide formal training to each employee. The nature of the instructions it is obligated to provide its employees will vary from one situation to another." No law, rule, or regulation requires an agency to provide training to an appellant prior to removal for performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Macijauskas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 564, 569 n.2 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Cho v. Dwight David Eisenhower Army Med. Ctr.</span>, 8 MSPR 52, 57-58, 7 MSPB 548 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Siegelman v. DHUD</span>, 14 MSPR 326 (1983)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bare v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 684, 689 (1986), found unconvincing appellant's protestation that he could have survived his PIP with additional training:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant has alleged that the agency should have provided him with additional training. The training the appellant alleged he needed in order to perform his work acceptably concerned mathematical calculations, chemical analyses, and the method by which tubes were to be placed in mice's stomachs. As we indicated above, however, the appellant was an experienced biological laboratory technician before he was assigned to the position from which he was removed, and he did not request assistance concerning these matters or others related to the assignment his second-level supervisor gave him. Furthermore, agency officials involved in the removal evidently were not aware, until after the appellant submitted his written products, that he was not proficient in the matters at issue here. Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's failure to offer the appellant additional training does not cause the removal to be improper.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We find it unnecessary to decide whether the agency would have been obligated to provide additional training if the appellant had advised the agency of his need.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Daniel v. VA</span>, 223 Fed. Appx. 986, 990 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), discerned no inherent requirement for training during a PIP, although the decision suggested guidance might be provided in agency regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Daniel notes that the agency denied his general request for formal training and argues that doing so was contrary to agency policy. At the Board hearing, a DVA human resources specialist testified that she would generally expect an employee on a PIP to bring up any training that he or she felt was needed. The specialist agreed that if an employee expressed a general desire for training, it would normally be appropriate for the supervisor to follow up with the employee regarding what specific training the employee desired. That testimony falls short of demonstrating that the DVA had a policy requiring a supervisor to recommend training opportunities in response to a general request for training. Nor was there any other testimony or written evidence of any DVA policy or general practice of that nature.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that "an agency does not have a generalized obligation to provide formal training during a PIP period." <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 204, 207 (1997) ("Although the appellant claims that the agency did not provide her with training and counseling, no training was required for the items she was called upon to accomplish during the PIP.");<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Hussey v. USDA</span>, DA-0432-13-0237-I-1 (NP 8/7/2014) ("The Board has found that an agency is not required to provide an employee with any formal training as part of an opportunity to improve under a PIP. <span class="Italic">Corbett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 288, 290 (1993). However, if an agency promises an employee assistance during a PIP and both fails to do so and otherwise prejudices the appellant or hinders his chances to succeed, then it does not meet its burden of proving that it provided the employee with an opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">Johnson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In a performance-based action taken under 5 USC 4303, the agency must prove by substantial evidence that it afforded the appellant the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sandland v.

The Board has held, however, that an agency is not required to provide an employee with any formal training as part of this opportunity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Macijauskas v.

The Board has also found that an agency does not meet its burden of proving that it afforded an appellant an opportunity to improve, where it promises an appellant assistance during a PIP, and then both fails to provide such assistance and otherwise prejudges the appellant or hinders the appellant's chances to succeed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 579 (1991); <span class="Italic">Adorador v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 461, 466 (1988); <span class="Italic">Zang v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In placing the appellant on her PIP in the present case, the appellant's supervisor, Ms. Lidija Erazo, both recounted the agency's past training efforts and offered the appellant additional assistance during her PIP. She noted that, since March 15, 1991, the appellant had four different trainers, including her current one, Ms. Sheryl Carrington. She stated that these trainers had been instructed to provide the appellant with day-to-day training and assistance, and that, even though the appellant had also been provided divisional, branch, and individualized training, she was unable to understand and put to use the fundamental elements of the small purchase acquisitions she was required to make in her position. Thus, she stated that the agency was delaying training the appellant regarding more complex large purchases. She further stated that, once the appellant reached a fully successful level in small purchases, she would be provided training for the more complex area of sealed bid acquisitions. Finally, Ms. Erazo informed the appellant as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During this period I will afford you four (4) hours to read FAR, Federal Acquisition Register, Part 13 and MAC Reg 70-3 in order to familiarize yourself with requirements. You will report directly to me when you have questions, concerning your work assignment. You and I will meet on a weekly basis to review work and progress, clarify issues and correct misunderstandings. At any time that you need assistance do not hesitate to ask questions. You will be responsible for researching appropriate directives and completing work assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the conclusion that the agency provided this promised assistance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also undisputed that, in addition to access to Ms. Erazo, the agency continued to provide the appellant with Ms. Carrington as a trainer during the PIP. Ms. Carrington testified that she trained the appellant on two days for approximately 1/2 day on each occasion during the PIP. Although, as the administrative judge found, Ms. Carrington testified that the appellant's PIP was unusual because the appellant was not allowed to direct questions to other employees, and because she was not given a plan to follow in training the appellant, her testimony also supports the conclusion that the agency met its offer of training and assistance. In this regard, she testified that she was instructed to train the appellant on new items that arose, that the appellant was free to come to her with questions, that there were no prohibitions or limitations on training, that she never refused a request for training, and that the appellant never expressed dissatisfaction with her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Ms. Erazo and the appellant corroborated Ms. Carrington's testimony regarding her availability to help the appellant, and the appellant's satisfaction with her efforts. Ms. Erazo testified that Ms. Carrington was instructed to help the appellant learn about new documents, and to be available to answer questions. She further testified that the appellant had previously expressed dissatisfaction with the three trainers assigned to her prior to Ms. Carrington, that she changed the appellant's trainers upon receiving complaints, and that the appellant never complained about Ms. Carrington's training efforts. The appellant also admitted that Ms. Carrington was available "most" of the time, that Ms. Carrington trained her on new items, and that she never asked Ms. Carrington for help in problem areas.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2968"></span>We find that the above evidence establishes that the agency satisfied the general regulatory requirements governing PIPs and opportunities to demonstrate acceptable performance, as well as any specific obligation it may have incurred in offering the appellant training and assistance during the PIP. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 432.103(e) (defining an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance as "a reasonable chance for the employee...to demonstrate acceptable performance in the critical element(s) and/or critical work objectives at issue"); <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 432.103(f) (setting forth the requirements for a PIP for a supervisory or managerial employee and specifically requiring an "offer [of) assistance to the employee"). We, therefore, conclude that the agency provided the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 464, 468-69 (1990); <span class="Italic">Macijauskas,</span> 34 MSPR at 567-69.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Corbett v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3533):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the record contains substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that the agency provided Corbett with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. Although other co-workers were instructed not to help Corbett, Corbett's supervisor and trainer were generally available to answer Corbett's questions. The documentary and testimonial evidence supports the finding that Corbett's supervisor met with Corbett on a weekly basis to give Corbett feedback on Corbett's performance. Moreover, it is undisputed that Corbett's trainer assisted Corbett on two days for approximately half the day on each occasion during the PIP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is in a developmental or training program when the PIP is imposed, the agency will be expected to provide the employee an opportunity to obtain tutoring or retesting, consistent with agency training requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gormley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 330, 333-34 (1990). A decision following remand in <span class="Italic">Gormley</span> concluded that if the employee is given an opportunity to improve during an apprenticeship or training program and the agency fails to properly notify the appellant of an exam he must take and pass to complete the program, the PIP is not reasonable and removal will not be sustained<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Gormley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 181, 187 (1991) (agency failed to inform an employee of the opportunity to take a make-up test).

EEOC</span>, 5 MSPR 19, 21, 5 MSPB 101 (1981). But failure to provide training to remedy performance deficiencies is not a prohibited personnel practice. Although it is a merit system principle that the work force be provided adequate training, no law, rule, or regulation implementing the merit system principle is violated if the agency fails to provide training. 5 USC 2302(b)(12); 5 USC 2301(b)(6), (7). <span class="Italic">Cho v.
