<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-82"><span class="space">1.</span> Light Duty and Job Modification</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Light duty cases may involve elements of both job restructuring and reassignment. Claims to light or limited duty assignments as an alternative to discharge, LWOP, or indefinite suspension produce many MSPB decisions, often depending on interpretation of collective bargaining agreements. [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-006.html#sec10-7">Furlough</a>" for applicability of furlough procedures to discontinuation of light duty assignments; refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-124.html#sec1-123">Temporary and Term Appointments</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-08-133.html#sec1-132">Postal Service Light Duty</a>" for Board jurisdiction over modification of temporary or intermittent appointments and light duty assignments for postal workers; Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-098.html#sec6-97">Light and Limited Duty; Medical Restriction</a>," includes decisions involving constructive suspension appeals arising out of disputes over light duty.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The source of any obligation for an agency to provide light duty work to an employee was indirectly explained in <span class="Italic">McFadden v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 18, 24-25 &#x00B6; 20 (1999), determining that an employee suffers a constructive suspension if light duty is denied under the requirements of agency policies or labor agreements or if light duty is an accommodation required for a disabled individual. <span class="Italic">McFadden</span> noted that if light duty is not required by policy or negotiated agreement, the agency need not create a permanent light duty position to accommodate the disabled appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency would be bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate the appellant's medical condition only if she showed that she was a qualified disabled employee under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c). A qualified disabled employee is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a disabled employee who, with or without accommodation, can perform the essential functions of her position, without endangering the health and safety of herself or others. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fox v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 MSPR 522 &#x00B6; 8 (1999). An agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning her to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mengine v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 MSPR 123 &#x00B6; 8 (1999); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 77 MSPR 486, 492 (1998). Thus, because with or without accommodation she could not perform the essential functions of her position, the appellant has not shown that the agency was bound by the Rehabilitation Act to accommodate her medical condition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The availability of light duty assignments should not be presumed, as is demonstrated by a passage from <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Lader</span>, 185 F.3d 1203, 1211 (11th Cir. 1999), involving an SBA employee who sought alternative employment while recuperating from heart surgery:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Sutton argues that the SBA could have allowed him to return to work as a construction analyst but given him some sort of "light duty." The evidence was undisputed, however, that there are no "light duty" construction analyst positions at the SBA. Nor is the SBA required to create such a position for Sutton. <span class="Italic">Shiring,</span> 90 F.3d at 831 ("employers are not required to create positions specifically for the handicapped employee"); <span class="Italic">Fedro v. Reno</span>, 21 F.3d 1391, 1395 &#x0026; n.5 (7th Cir. 1994) (Rehabilitation Act does not "require an employer to <span class="Italic">create</span> alternative employment opportunities for a handicapped employee") (emphasis in original); <span class="Italic">Davis,</span> 442 U.S. at 406, 99 S. Ct. 2361 (Rehabilitation Act does not require employer to change job requirements).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hurst v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 281 (1994), again attempted to relate disability accommodation and light duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that an agency does not have to permanently assign an employee to a light duty position to which he had been assigned where his duties consisted of bits and pieces of other positions and such duties constitute only a portion of an existing position. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 36 MSPR at 165. Nor is an agency required to create a position where none exists. <span class="Italic">Capuzzi v. Dept. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 314, 316 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has found that when an employee seeks reassignment as an accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act, the agency may be required to reassign him to a light-duty position that has been restructured to remove nonessential functions the appellant cannot perform. <span class="Italic">See Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 668-69 (1991); <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 36 MSPR at 167. Such restructuring is not required if tasks which the appellant is physically unable or unqualified to perform are "essential functions" of the position. 29 CFR 1630.2(o). We therefore find that if there was a vacant Warehouseman position during this period, the appellant's discrimination claim would rest upon a determination of whether such a position could have been restructured to accommodate the appellant's disability, including an evaluation of whether heavy lifting or carrying were "essential functions" of this position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(n). Because the administrative judge failed to address this potential accommodation, we find that it is necessary to remand the case for further adjudication on this point.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its precedent involving light duty in a permanent, complete, restructured position, <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 668-69 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency need not accommodate a handicapped employee by permanently assigning him to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162 (1988). If, however, the appellant's request for the restructuring accommodation were to result in the appellant's having a position that the agency would define as light duty, that would not negate the agency's obligation to restructure the job. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 53, 57 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, with regard to the regulation defining a "qualified handicapped employee" as one who is able, with or without accommodation, to perform the essential duties of the "position in question," the term "position in question" is not limited to the employee's original position; rather the term may be read to include other positions to which the employee may be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ellis v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 503 (1988). Thus, the agency may be required to accommodate an employee by reassigning him to a light-duty position, as long as the essential duties remain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because, in this case, the appellant's light-duty Operation 030 position is also a reassignment position that has been restructured to remove non-essential duties that the appellant cannot perform because of his lifting restriction, the appellant has articulated an accommodation under which he can perform the necessary duties of that position. Thus, the appellant has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination with respect to the Operation 030 and the FSM positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency failed to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The agency did not come forward with evidence that the appellant's articulated accommodation, relieving him of the ledge-loading and sweeping duties, was unreasonable and would impose an undue hardship on the agency's operation....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Lighter duty, rather than creation of a permanent light duty job, is an <span id="Page_3477"></span>accepted form of accommodative job modification. <span class="Italic">Tornatore v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 381, 385-86 (1988), analyzed the proof that must be offered by an agency claiming that job modification presents an undue hardship. The accommodation sought by the appellant, a boilermaker, was that he be excused from job rotation and, instead, that he be allowed to perform his duties exclusively in the shop rather than aboard ships. The accommodation was reasonable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency maintains that all Boilermaker workers must be able to perform their duties shipboard on a rotational basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's assertion that it can never accommodate a qualified handicapped employee in the job category of Boilermaker by allowing a permanent shop assignment does not constitute articulation of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and is insufficient to show undue hardship. The agency has offered no specific evidence supporting its assertion that being included in ship work rotation is an essential duty of the appellant's position....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]ome Boilermaker workers are assigned to the shop at all times, [they] perform the full range of the duties of the position when they are in the shop and that at least for limited time periods, some are not subject to shipboard rotation. While it is true that reasonable accommodation will take the appellant out of the rotation to shipboard work, a job structure different from non-handicapped employees, the agency has not shown that this difference amounts to undue hardship. The Board has held that some differences in job structure between handicapped and non-handicapped employees is within the spirit and provisions of the Rehabilitation Act....&#8197;Further...testimony acknowledges that the agency's need for Boilermaker workers in the shop will provide sufficient work for the appellant within his limitations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the agency has offered no specific evidence to show that budgetary restrictions prevent the accommodation of permanent shop assignment...or that it would incur any additional cost by accommodating the appellant's handicap through such an assignment. Thus, the Board finds that the appellant established that the ability to work shipboard is not an essential duty of the Boilermaker worker...and the agency did not articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its actions....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Without commenting on an agency's responsibility to continue a light duty assignment permanently, <span class="Italic">Sweet v. DHHS</span>, 14 MSPR 168, 171 (1982), determined that an agency properly accommodated an individual who was on light duty status for more than four years following a work-related injury and who was then reassigned to another job in another location, without loss of pay, when it was determined that the physical disability was permanent. When the employee declined to report to the new job, he was removed. The removal was sustained. <span class="Italic">Nuanez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 32 MSPR 144, 147 (1987), accepted the EEOC's position that an appellant who successfully performed during a light duty assignment should have been considered for accommodation through job restructuring or reassignment to a position calling for restricted duties. Although the decision did not endorse permanent light duty, it suggested that successful performance in light duty is indicative of the likely success of job restructuring. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Meadows v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 153, 156 (1981) ("The agency has not asserted that appellant was not safely performing useful and efficient service under the temporary assignments, but it made no attempt to reasonably accommodate him on a permanent basis[.] ").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Snipes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 165, 167-68 (1984), the employee, disabled with a back injury, was placed on light duty status for six or seven years. Reviewing his termination, the Board concluded that tenure in light duty status does not establish entitlement to permanent or continuing light duty assignment, particularly with a permanent condition involving a job the agency could not permanently restructure because of its need for the position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's argument is essentially that, since the agency had maintained him in a light duty position for approximately ten years, it had in effect "restructured" his position, and it could not now claim that such accommodation of appellant imposes an undue hardship on its operation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official considered this argument and rejected it, noting that "a light duty status by its very nature presumes that the employee will recover and resume the full duties of his position at some future time." Medical evidence in the record supports this view, since it indicates that appellant was placed on light duty status for short periods of time only, and that the status was then continued only after further medical evaluations indicated he was unable to perform his full duties. Therefore, appellant's tenure in a light duty status did not establish any entitlement to a permanent or continuing light duty assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant argues that the agency would not suffer any undue hardship by permitting appellant to continue in his light duty position. This argument is answered by agency witness William Russell, a Commissary Store Officer at the Oceana branch store, Naval Air Station, Oceana, who testified that, after receiving the fitness for duty report on Mr. Snipes, he considered restructuring Mr. Snipes' position, but concluded that, if the job were restructured to meet Mr. Snipes' medical needs, the position would have to be abolished. The record also contains a memorandum from the Director of Commissary Store Division to the Director of the Civilian Personnel Department stating that "the requirement for full level performance in the position coupled with staffing limitations precludes the restructuring or job engineering of [Mr. Snipes'] position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These reasons are sufficient to establish that the requested "restructuring" of the position would impose an undue hardship on the agency. The agency has shown itself willing to accommodate appellant's recurring back problem on numerous occasions over the past ten years. However, appellant's condition has now been diagnosed as "chronic and stable." Further, appellant concedes that he cannot perform the full duties of the position. Therefore, the type of accommodation being sought is permanent rather than temporary in nature. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the agency had no obligation to retain appellant in a light duty position.[*] <span class="Italic">See Sweet v. HHS,</span> 12 MSPB 325 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[*] In the initial decision, the presiding official found that the agency had attempted to accommodate appellant by reassigning him and that such reassignment would represent an undue hardship. Appellant does not reassert, in his petition for review, his earlier argument on the issue of reassignment. We note, in this regard, that the Board has recently held that "an agency is not required, by law or regulation, to consider the reassignment of an employee in order to accommodate his handicapping condition." <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 16 MSPR 530 at 542 (1983). Thus, the agency's efforts to reassign appellant exceeded its obligation to accommodate him.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed from his position as a Housekeeping Aid, WG3566-3, at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, effective April 18, 2008, for inability to perform the physical requirements of the position.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an ID finding that the agency established that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of a Housekeeping Aid.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although as a federal employee, the appellant's claim arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act and are applied to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Pinegar v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not testify regarding his back condition other than to say he was injured while serving as a paratrooper and again on the job at the agency and that he could not perform the essential functions of the Housekeeping Aid position. He did not discuss the particular limitations resulting from his condition. However, the agency found the appellant unfit for duty based on a July 20, 2007 report from a physician who had treated him since 2003. As discussed more fully in the ID at 6-7, the report shows that the appellant had persistent lumbar pain due to bulging and deteriorating discs. His physician stated that the appellant should avoid carrying and lifting more than 20 pounds, flexing forward, stair climbing, and prolonged sitting and standing. We find that these limitations are sufficient to find the appellant has a disability within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act, even under the stringent pre-ADAAA standard. <span class="Italic">See Clark v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's Housekeeping Aid position required continuous walking, standing, stooping, lifting (including weights of up to 50 pounds), pushing, pulling, and bending. The appellant testified that he could not perform the essential functions of the position and that there was no accommodation in the position that would enable him to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's contention throughout the proceedings was that he had been accommodated since 2002 by being reassigned to clerical duties and that he should have been allowed to continue to perform these duties rather than being removed. The administrative judge correctly held, however, that the record contains no evidence the agency ever formally reassigned the appellant to a permanent limited or light duty position; rather, he continued to encumber the Housekeeping Aid position, although he was performing different duties. Provision of such limited or light duty tasks that do not constitute a separate position is not a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Collins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 13.

In this case, the appellant, who had earned a B.A. in accounting, requested reassignment to a vacant administrative position. The position, however, was higher graded, and so the agency rejected the appellant's request in both its proposal and decision to remove him. The appellant testified he knew of no other positions to which he could have been reassigned. Moreover, the agency produced as a hearing exhibit a list of vacant positions at the San Juan VAMC at the time of the appellant's removal, showing that the only vacancies at or below his grade level were in the food service and laundry. The position descriptions show that these positions had stringent physical requirements similar to or greater than those of the Housekeeping Aid. Therefore, the appellant would not have been qualified for those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Geographical location is among the factors to be considered, but an agency's reassignment obligation is not limited by geographical area, facility or personnel system. <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at 19-20. Moreover, the employee need not compete for a vacant position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21.

It also provided that if a vacancy had been posted, the agency was only required to consider the employee requiring accommodation on an equal basis with other applicants. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain evidence showing that the agency considered the appellant for any position other than the administrative job he requested or that it otherwise engaged in the interactive process through which a reasonable accommodation is identified. The agency asserted on appeal that the appellant never made an accommodation request. However, "an employee only has a general responsibility to inform his employer that he needs accommodation for a medical condition." <span class="Italic">Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (citing 29 C.F.R. part 1630 Appendix, &#x00A7; 1630.2(9)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at 5 (to make an accommodation request, an individual need only let the employer know that he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition and need not use the words "reasonable accommodation"). Once the employee does so, the employer must engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at 6. In this case, the appellant had requested reassignment to an administrative position prior to his removal. Such a request is a request for a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Jones v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</span> 502 F.3d 1176, 1194 (10th Cir. 2007). Moreover, there is no dispute that the agency was aware <span id="Page_3479"></span>of the appellant's medical condition and need for accommodation, since he had been on light or limited duty for approximately 6 years. <span class="Italic">See Conneen v. MBNA America Bank, N.A.,</span> 334 F.3d 318, 332 (3d Cir. 2003) (accommodation effort triggered where employer has enough information to know of the disability and desire for accommodation). Therefore, under the circumstances of this case, we find that the agency had an obligation to engage in the interactive process and search for a reassignment for the appellant prior to removing him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, however, the agency ultimately produced evidence at the hearing that there was no appropriate vacancy to which he could be reassigned, and the appellant did not identify any. The failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather the appellant must show that this omission resulted in failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See McBride v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above evidence, we find that the appellant did not show that he was denied reasonable accommodation and thus did not prove his affirmative defense of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 24 (to prevail, the appellant must prove, not merely articulate, that the accommodation he seeks is reasonable); <span class="Italic">Henry,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 15 (the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proof).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 680, 696-99 (1996), considered the elements of light duty, job restructuring, and reassignment to a vacant position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the appellant must show, as a threshold matter, that he is disabled for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC 791. A "disability" under the Act is, among other things, a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The fact that an impairment makes an employee unable to do a particular job does not necessarily mean that he is disabled, however; the impairment must foreclose generally the type of employment involved.<span class="Italic"> See Groshans v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 629, 635-37 (1995); <span class="Italic">Cohen v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 369, 373-74 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that lifting heavy objects, or long periods of standing or walking, causes synovial fluid pressure to build up in his toe. He also testified that the pressure in his toe tends to increase throughout the day. According to the appellant, the pressure causes intense pain. In December of 1990 and January of 1991, the appellant's physician described the appellant's limitations as follows: He cannot lift more than 20 lbs.; he cannot walk for more than two hours per day; he cannot push or lift heavy objects; and he cannot stand for "prolong[ed] periods." The appellant's physician noted that the appellant's limitations are "permanent." The appellant did not submit an official description for the Mailhandler position, but he described its essential duties as lifting 70-lb. sacks of mail from trucks, loading the sacks into carts, pushing the carts to an unloading area, and unloading the sacks onto belts and into trays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has shown that he is "disabled" within the meaning of the Rehabilitation Act. His toe condition substantially limits the major life activities of walking and standing. Furthermore, he is foreclosed generally from the type of employment involved, namely, manual labor. His restrictions do not allow him to perform unskilled labor requiring him to be on his feet all day or to carry heavy things. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hurst v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 281 (1994) (a Machinist and Pipefitter who became unable to perform the class of jobs involving "heavy physical labor" was disabled).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having established that he is disabled, the appellant must articulate a "reasonable accommodation" under which he believes he could perform the essential duties of his position or a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Dept. of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988). In January of 1991 the appellant submitted a set of medical restrictions that included a request for light duty or to be retrained. We find that the appellant articulated what he believed to be a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pledger</span>, 50 MSPR at 331-32 (by informing the agency of his medical restrictions and indicating that "he might be able to perform the duties of [a]Laborer position...if it were restructured, [the appellant] articulated a method by which he believed the agency could reasonably accommodate his [disability] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the burden then shifts to the agency to show that the action at issue was based on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. The agency can meet that burden by showing that the appellant is not a qualified, disabled individual, that is: the requested accommodation would not have allowed the appellant to safely perform the essential duties of his position, or that it would have created an undue hardship on the agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 10, 13 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining undue hardship, the Board has held that the agency was "not required to make [the requested] accommodation unless any employment barrier posed by the appellant's [disability] " would have been "surmountable without substantial modification in the requirements" of the Mailhandler position. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. In this connection, the agency was not required to create a permanent light-duty position where none otherwise existed, but if the essential duties of the Mailhandler position would have remained after restructuring it, the agency was required to have afforded the requested accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 668-69 (1991); <span class="Italic">see also Hurst</span>, 61 MSPR at 281 (an agency must restructure a position to accommodate a disability by removing nonessential functions the employee cannot perform, but such restructuring is not required if tasks the employee is unable to perform are essential to the job).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant described the Mailhandler duties as lifting 70-lb. sacks of mail from trucks, loading the sacks into carts, pushing the carts to an unloading area, and unloading the sacks onto belts and into trays. His restrictions, as outlined by his physician, precluded him from performing these duties. He could have worked only two hours at a time, and even then he could only have lifted 20-lb. sacks of mail. Both Searuggs and Cheryl Faile, Supervisor of Distribution Operations, testified that the appellant could not have performed the "core duties" of a Mailhandler under the restrictions outlined by his physician. The appellant does not claim that he could perform the full range of Mailhandler duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 156 (1988), the agency was required to accommodate the appellant's physical limitations by reassigning him from his physically arduous Aircraft Worker position to a Materials Sorter and Classifier position. The appellant could perform all of the duties of the latter position, save for the incidental task of lifting materials baskets once they were full. Either co-workers could lift the baskets for him or he could scoop materials out with a shovel until a basket was light enough, without an appreciable loss of productivity. In the present case, by contrast, lifting heavy objects, pushing carts, and standing and walking all day--things the appellant cannot do--are at the heart of the Mailhandler position, not incidental to it. We find, therefore, that the agency was not required to restructure the Mailhandler position to accommodate the appellant's restrictions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Miller</span>, 42 MSPR at 13-14 (the agency was not required to accommodate a painter's condition by purchasing special equipment for him to move heavy objects, when with the requested accommodation his productivity would have been between one-fifth and one-twentieth of that of other painters).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the agency was not required to restructure the Mailhandler position to accommodate the appellant's limitations, the remaining question is whether the agency was required to reassign him to a vacant position, the duties of which he could perform with or without accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. The appellant argues <span id="Page_3480"></span>on review that the agency should have reassigned him to the light-duty position identified by Searuggs in September of 1990. Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the light-duty assignment was a separate position, however, it was not within the restrictions the appellant claimed to be under at the time, namely, he could work mornings only.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the agency should have reassigned him to "a position" after receiving his revised medical restrictions in January of 1991. He further contends that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) applicable to him did not preclude assignment to another craft. Still, he does not allege that there are any positions, vacant or otherwise, that he could have performed within the Mailhandler craft. Although he implied at the hearing that he might have been able to perform Clerk duties using a rest bar for his foot, he also admitted that he was not qualified for positions in the Clerk craft, that he never sought reassignment to the Clerk craft, and that he was not even sure that he could perform any job requiring standing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, although he requested light duty twice, he did not raise the possibility of changing crafts. In this connection, Searuggs stated that employees with medical restrictions must request reassignment....&#8197;Under the circumstances, we have no basis for finding that the agency discriminated against the appellant by not reassigning him to a vacant position, the duties of which he could perform with or without accommodation, for the appellant has not even identified a type of job in which he believes he could have been accommodated. <span class="Italic">Cf. White v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 68 (1990) (the appellant's argument that the agency did not consider restructuring positions "other than those he identified" to accommodate his disability was rejected; the agency was only required "to consider whether vacant positions identified by the appellant" could be restructured); <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 485, 492 n.9 (1990) (to meet "his burden of articulating a reasonable accommodation" by reassignment, the appellant was required to "refer[&#8197;] to a specific position whose duties he believed he could perform").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">D'Leo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 44, 49-50 (1992), determined it was appropriate to terminate an indefinite light duty assignment for a physically incapacitated employee when budget conditions required curtailment of positions and to separate for inability to perform a job an employee who could not perform in the original or other vacant position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant was a qualified handicapped employee entitled to reasonable accommodation because he had a physical impairment substantially limiting one or more major life activities and he had articulated a reasonable accommodation. He had noted several positions other than Pipefitter Worker positions which were vacant and for which he met the minimum qualifications and the duties of which he was physically able to perform. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(a) and (f); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 148, 152 (1988); <span class="Italic">See also Anderson v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 136, 141 (1990) (to be considered handicapped, an impairment "must foreclose generally the type of employment involved"). In this case, there is no dispute that the appellant was foreclosed from Pipefitter Worker positions and any such position involving heavy or active labor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly concluded that, under the unique circumstances affecting the agency, it would have been an undue hardship to require the agency to accommodate the appellant. She noted the budget cuts, the fact that the agency had accommodated numerous employees with handicaps by placing them in permanent vacant positions which they could physically perform, and the fact that the appellant had no greater need or right to an accommodation than did any of the other handicapped employees that the agency placed in vacant positions. Additionally, as the administrative judge noted, Virgil Davis, the deciding official, testified that the appellant was the most restricted employee in the shop and the least likely to be placed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency's failure to place the appellant did not constitute handicap discrimination. <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Education,</span> 31 MSPR 519, 529-30 (Spec. Pan. 1986) (the requirement that an agency accommodate a qualified handicapped employee is not infinite--it must search its vacancies and take other potentially fruitful steps, but it need not consider reassignment <span class="Italic">ad infinitum</span> or create a position where none exists), <span class="Italic">vacated on other</span> <span class="Italic">grounds sub nom. Lynch v. Bennett,</span> 665 F. Supp. 62 (D.D.C. 1987); <span class="Italic">Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 36 MSPR 162 (1988) (an agency need not accommodate a handicapped employee by permanently assigning him to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Joyner v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 596, 600-01 (1991), also declined to require permanent light duty as an accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may not discriminate against a "qualified...handicapped person." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.703. The mere existence of a handicap, however, is insufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that an individual is a qualified handicapped employee; the employee must articulate a reasonable accommodation that the agency could or should have made in order to enable him to perform successfully. <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 373, 378 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also Brown v. United States Postal Service,</span> 46 MSPR 252, 256 (1990). We concur in the administrative judge's determination that the appellant failed to show that he was discriminated against on the basis of his physical impairments, because, even if he was handicapped, he failed to articulate a reasonable accommodation in his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant argues that vacancies occurred in positions for which he was qualified just prior to and immediately following his removal; that the agency could have or should have reasonably anticipated appropriate vacancies; and that its failure to assign him to a vacancy constitutes a failure to reasonably accommodate his condition. He further argues that the agency's inability to find work for him after 10 years of light duty constitutes discrimination on the basis of his handicapping condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find these allegations without merit. As the administrative judge found, the agency was not required to continue to employ the appellant until a suitable position was found. <span class="Italic">See Johnston v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 39 MSPR 451, 457 (1989). With respect to the allegation regarding vacancies existing before his removal, we note that the appellant identifies those vacancies only by referring to the verification section and to nuclear log clerk work. Those references indicate that the appellant's allegation concerns light duty assignments he performed before his removal. A prior assignment to light duty does not establish entitlement to permanent light duty once it is clear that the employee's handicap is permanent. <span class="Italic">See Brown,</span> 46 MSPR at 255; <span class="Italic">Lamb v. Department of the Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 79, 84-85 (1989). Therefore the agency was not required to assign the appellant permanently to the light duty assignments to which refers. <span class="Italic">See White v. Department of the Army,</span> 46 MSPR 63, 68 (1990) (agency need not create a position to accommodate handicapped employee where none exists).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Permanent light duty in an incomplete position was eschewed as a required accommodation in <span class="Italic">Warren v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 97, 100 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency need not accommodate a handicapped employee by permanently assigning him to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 661, 668 (1991). The fact that an employee performing light-duty tasks has sufficient work to engage him full time does not establish that the employee is performing the duties of a complete and separate position. The agency may cull out the light-duty elements of one position, or of several positions, and assign them to an employee who needs light duty without having <span class="Italic">de facto</span> created a separate position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 165 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant admits that she could not perform the full range of duties of the complete and separate position of Laundry Clerk. Her light-duty assignment, although occupying her full time, did not encompass the full range of duties of the Laundry Clerk position. The agency established that the full range of duties included more standing, walking, stooping, and bending than the light-duty assignment. While the appellant had full-time duties, she did not occupy a separate full-time position. The agency was under no obligation to assign her permanently to those duties. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McQueen v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 53 MSPR 530, 535 (1992) (an agency's obligation to accommodate an employee's handicap does not require it to create a position where none exists).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mengine v. Runyon</span>, 114 F.3d 415, 418 (3d Cir. 1997) (rare cases aside, it is unreasonable to expect the employer to convert a temporary light duty position to a permanent position as an accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">Schoener v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPR 239, 243 (1981) ("[A]ssigning light duties to appellant placed a greater strain on his fellow employees....&#8197;[It] enabled him to spend only four to six hours per day productively employed. Because appellant's restrictions were such that, in addition to not lifting weights over 35 pounds, he was not able to bend, even most light duty was unsuitable for him.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 676, 679-680 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 252, 255 (1990), the employer was not required to continue an employee in light duty status when it became clear that the employee's disabling condition was permanent. The law was again summarized in <span class="Italic">Bauman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 209, 219 (1992): "[A] prior assignment to light duty does not establish a continuing entitlement to light duty when a handicapping condition is permanent...an agency need not accommodate a handicapped employee by permanently assigning him to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position." <span class="Italic">Bauman</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Crew v.
