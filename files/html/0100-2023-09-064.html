<p class="Body-Text">If physical or mental impairment or illness is asserted as a basis for waiving the appellate deadline, the AJ should clearly inform the appellant of the type of evidence he should provide and the need to link the medical impairment with the inability to timely file the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cordero v. VA</span>, AT-0752-13-0986-I-1 (NP 3/28/2014) ("To establish that an untimely filing was the result of a medical condition, the party must: (1) identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit evidence showing that he suffered from the illness during the relevant time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time."). [<span class="Italic">Cordero</span> is discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-050.html#sec2-49">Judge's Responsibility to Provide Notice Concerning a Timeliness Issue</a>."] 28 USC 2401(a), allowing for an action against the United States within three years after a disability ceases, has no application to timeliness determinations by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gershfeld v. MSPB</span>, 232 Fed. Appx. 972, 975 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A late appeal is excused by medical evidence that, during the filing period, the appellant was under medical care for a condition that impaired his ability to file legal papers. <span class="Italic">Hampton v. VA</span>, 25 MSPR 246, 248 (1984) (hospitalization and treatment for depression and PTSD); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DOJ</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (appellant was hospitalized); <span class="Italic">O'Reilly v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 693, 697 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (excusing the delay of a little more than a month following a year-long hospitalization; mental status was irrelevant since the hospitalization was a sufficient basis for the waiver of the appellate deadline); <span class="Italic">Rocio v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 518, 521 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (excusing a delay in appeal of six days following release from the hospital); <span class="Italic">Saturley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 69 MSPR 522, 528 &#x0026; n.6 (1996) (although the waiver is not "automatic" for a short appeal delay, the appellant's delay of one day was excused by a "debilitating medical condition, which severely restricted her mobility and possibly her mental faculties"); <span class="Italic">Kool v. DHHS</span>, 69 MSPR 290, 294 (1996) ("While [appellant] was not hospitalized during a portion of the filing period as was the appellant in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, we find that a similar concern for one's health while recovering from surgery is understandable and does not show a lack of due diligence by the appellant, considering the minimal 3-day delay here, his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status below, his loss of mobility because of the catheterization, and the absence of any prejudice to the agency.").<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mack v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 253, 254, 1 MSPB 241 (1979), concluded that an appellant who was not represented by counsel demonstrated good cause for extending the time for filing an appeal when, at the time of his removal, he was hospitalized for surgery. He filed his appeal promptly upon his release from the hospital. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 588, 590 (1991) (eye injury caused the appellant's incapacitation and inability to timely perfect his appeal; the AJ was incorrect in concluding that the appellant could have made arrangements for another person to have completed the appeal: a party need not show that it was impossible to timely file; he need only demonstrate that his actions were reasonably prudent to establish good cause for the untimely appeal); <span class="Italic">Juchert v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 104, 104 (1980) (appeal filed the day after the appellant was released from the hospital in a chemical dependency treatment program: "Circumstances such as hospitalization extending beyond the regulatory time limit as prescribed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) have been held by the Board to constitute good cause for appellant's failure to file a timely appeal."). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. OPM</span>, 63 MSPR 131, 134 (1994) (neither illness of appellant nor hospitalization of her representative materially interfered with her ability to file timely appeal); <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 15, 16 n.* (1985) (due diligence was not shown by the appellant who, while hospitalized, called his union but failed to discuss his appeal with his representative and failed to authorize him to file on his behalf).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is criticized for its unreasonable assessment of the ability of individuals with incapacitating illnesses to file their appeals at some hypothetical date arbitrarily fixed by an AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. DOJ</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The government argues that Anderson had one full week to file his appeal after he was released from the hospital and that he failed to act diligently and with ordinary prudence in filing his appeal on time. We do not agree, since Anderson stated that he took action toward filing his appeal <span id="Page_950"></span>immediately upon his release from the hospital but was unable to contact his representative. These circumstances collectively constitute a reasonable excuse for Anderson's delay and the government has not alleged that it was prejudiced by the minimal delay."; "A holding of lack of good cause under these circumstances is equivalent to requiring a showing that it was impossible to appeal in time, which is not the law. In view of the minimal delay, the reasonableness of the excuse, and the lack of prejudice to the government, it was an abuse of discretion for the AJ not to waive the time limit for good cause."). In <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 90-3406), the Board was the object of commentary by its reviewing court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant need not demonstrate the <span class="Italic">impossibility</span> of filing an appeal on time but merely good cause for delay. The Administrative Judge's judgment that a person in the hospital for mental treatment, or indeed, for any treatment must diligently pursue appeal rights while confined, or on the day of release, is divorced from the reality of normal behavior. Tolling the time for the period of his hospitalization or granting an extension for the length of his hospitalization would afford him only a total of twenty days in which to file and would make his filing within nineteen days timely. We conclude that the Administrative Judge applied the standard of "good cause" too strictly in this case and thereby abused his discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board generally will extend the time for filing an appeal pending the appellant's release from a hospital. <span class="Italic">Mongtomery v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 401, 404-05 (1998), considered the effect of receipt of the adverse action documentation by appellant's "agent" while the appellant was in the hospital:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]here an agency fails to provide an employee with notice of the employee's removal on or before the effective date of the removal, the date of the employee's receipt of the removal notice must be considered the effective date of the removal for purposes of the running of the period for filing a Board appeal of that removal action. <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, 25 F.3d at 1014; <span class="Italic">accord</span> <span class="Italic">McClendon v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 66 MSPR 211, 213-14 (1995). In such a case, it is irrelevant for purposes of determining the timeliness of the appeal whether the employee needed the full filing period or whether the employee could have contacted the agency concerning the appeal requirements. <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, 25 F.3d at 1014; <span class="Italic">accord Alejandro v. Department of the Navy,</span> 64 MSPR 506, 508 (1994). Thus, the appellant's petition for appeal of his removal had to be filed no later than 30 days from the date of his receipt of the agency's decision letter to be timely....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not disputed the agency's assertion and record evidence that his agent received the agency's decision letter on January 15, 1997....&#8197;Notwithstanding, the appellant asserted that he was hospitalized from January 8, through January 24, 1997, and that he did not receive the agency's decision letter until January 27, 1997, 3 days after his release from the hospital....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[C]ontrary to the agency's argument, the fact that his agent received the decision letter on January 15, 1997, does not disprove the appellant's allegation that he did not personally receive the decision letter until January 27, 1997. Waiting 3 days after his release from the hospital to retrieve his mail from his agent is not unreasonable nor incredible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Justice,</span> 999 F.2d 532, 534 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[o]ne who is hospitalized is entitled to give primary consideration to recovery of his health without being considered to lack diligence in showing good cause"; finding an attorney within 4 days of release from a hospital is not unreasonable). Thus, we find that the appellant received the agency's decision letter on January 27, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having not received notice of his removal until January 27, 1997, when he received the agency's decision letter, the appellant had, under <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, 30 days from January 27, 1997, i.e., on or before February 26, 1997, to timely file his appeal of the removal action....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In evaluating evidence of medical incapacity to file an appeal, consideration may be given to other litigation-oriented activities pursued by the appellant during the period of incapacitation, <span class="Italic">Estrada v. MSPB</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 942, 945 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As the AJ noted, while hospitalization during the filing period may support a finding of good cause, Ms. Estrada's hospitalization period did not overlap with the filing period for her Board appeal. Record evidence establishes that Ms. Estrada was able to engage the OPM, the Department of Labor, and the Embassy of the Philippines in Washington, DC through written correspondence during this time period. The AJ thus correctly concluded that Ms. Estrada's health condition was not so severely debilitating as to impair her ability to timely file her Board appeal.</p>

Cir. 2012 NP) ("Even though Rivera was proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, Rivera did not show that her illness (which the AJ acknowledged) or any other reason rendered her unable to file within the time required by the Board's regulations. On the contrary, the evidence shows that within this time frame she participated in other proceedings, requesting and appearing for hearings to testify on her own behalf, despite her various medical conditions."); <span class="Italic">Metcalfe v. MSPB</span>, 214 Fed. Appx. 987, 989 (Fed.
