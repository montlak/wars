<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-10"><span class="space">2.</span> Jurisdiction or Timeliness as Alternate Bases for Dismissal of Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may elect not to decide a timeliness issue if it is simpler to address a jurisdictional issue (or the Board may dismiss the case on a timeliness issue rather than decide a thornier jurisdictional matter). [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-011.html#sec5-12">Timeliness and Jurisdictional Issues</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-12-151.html#sec5-150">Timeliness of Appeal</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-12-066.html#sec5-66">Jurisdictional Issue</a>."] The most frequently cited decision on the point, <span class="Italic">Popham v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 193, 197-98 (1991), allows AJs some discretion, depending on the state of the record, to choose among dispositive issues, with a general preference for nonjurisdictional dismissals when timeliness or other threshold reasons for dismissal are presented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold here that, while the existence of Board jurisdiction is the threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, a jurisdictional determination would not be in the Board's interest of adjudicatory efficiency and fairness to the parties involved in an untimely appeal in which (a) the Board arguably may have jurisdiction over the appeal and (b) the record developed on the timeliness issue shows no good cause for the untimely filing,[2] or (c) other grounds exist for the dismissal of the appeal.[3] Thus, if the record is sufficiently developed on the issue of timeliness or other grounds to show that an appeal should be dismissed on other than a jurisdictional basis, then an administrative judge may properly determine, by assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction (without actually making fact findings and conclusions of law on the jurisdictional issue), that dismissal of the appeal is warranted.[4] In all other circumstances,[5] however, the administrative judge must: (1) Make an actual jurisdictional determination; (2) make a determination on the issues of timeliness or other grounds, if necessary; (3) conduct further proceedings on the merits; and (4) make a determination on all other material issues of fact and law.[6] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;For example, an appellant, who claims that good cause has been shown for a waiver of the time limit for his untimely appeal of an alleged involuntary resignation or retirement, does not carry his burden of proof on the timeliness issue where the record shows that he failed to assert, much less establish, that the agency knew that he perceived the action as one obtained through duress or coercion and, therefore, had an obligation to inform him of his right to file a timely appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gaynor v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 481, 484 (1990). In cases such as <span class="Italic">Gaynor</span>, the parties' substantive rights would not be prejudiced by not affording the appellant a jurisdictional hearing and a determination on that issue, because the ultimate outcome is the same regardless of any finding on the jurisdictional issue, i.e., the dismissal of the appeal by the Board without any determination on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wooten v. Government Printing Office</span>, 21 MSPR 425, 426-27 (1984) (the administrative judge properly dismissed the appellant's petition for enforcement based on the equitable doctrine of laches because the appellant unreasonably and inexcusably delayed for more than 1 year in filing his petition).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Manning v. Trustees of Tufts College</span>, 613 F.2d 1200 (1st Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Hochstadt v. Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology</span>, 545 F.2d 222 (1st Cir. 1976)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This would include appeals where the issues of jurisdiction and timeliness are inextricably intertwined so as to require a jurisdictional determination before the timeliness issue can be addressed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This analysis applies henceforth to all Board appeals in which final decisions have not yet been rendered. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bivens v. Department of the Navy</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 67, 71-72 (1988); <span class="Italic">Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fain v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Board jurisdiction is normally the threshold issue in adjudicating an appeal, for its jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). When faced with an untimely appeal of questionable jurisdiction, however, the Board may not deem a jurisdictional determination to be in the interest of efficiency and fairness, if the record is sufficiently developed to show that the appeal should be dismissed because no good cause exists for the untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Higgins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6; 6 (2000). On the other hand, dismissal of an appeal on timeliness grounds may not be appropriate where resolution of the timeliness issue depends upon whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable action, and "the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. On the issue of timeliness, the appellant bears the burden of proof. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)] .</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appropriate case, an AJ may assume that an appellant was subjected to an appealable action and has standing to appeal and proceed to dismiss an appeal as untimely filed if the record on timeliness is sufficiently developed. <span class="Italic">Hanna v.

Moreover, it is undisputed that the agency did not provide the appellant with notice of his right to appeal an alleged involuntary disability retirement to the Board, and, accordingly, any time limits for filing an appeal. Therefore, because the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined, this appeal should not have been disposed of on timeliness grounds without first addressing jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6; <span class="Italic">Shelton</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 15.</p>

Where the Board clearly lacks jurisdiction over an appeal, however, and where the existing record suggests that the question of timeliness is close, the better practice is to address the jurisdictional issue and dismiss the appeal on that ground. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burger v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 582, &#x00B6; 44 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Hayes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 390 F.3d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2004). We note that our holding here does not reverse the general rule, first set forth in <span class="Italic">Popham</span>, that an administrative judge may dismiss an appeal on timeliness grounds where the record is sufficiently developed on that issue but where Board jurisdiction remains unresolved. Rather, our holding is limited to the narrow set of cases where uncertainty exists as to the timeliness question but the Board clearly lacks jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, regarding the timeliness issue, the appellant attributes her two-day delay in filing her appeal to: (1) The confusion caused by her receipt of three separate letters from the agency on April 30, 2004--the decision notice, a letter informing her that her VERA/VSIP approval had been revoked, and a letter informing her that she tested positive for illegal drug use; (2) her mother's sudden bout with cancer; (3) her son's bitter separation from his wife; (4) the incarceration of her youngest son; and (5) the difficulty of moving her daughter home from college and sending her to Africa for a student exchange. The appellant also asserts that another attorney, whom she retained prior to filing this Board appeal with the assistance of different counsel, provided her with incorrect information regarding the time limit for filing the appeal. Given the appellant's good cause arguments, coupled with the minimal length of her filing delay, we acknowledge that the question of timeliness is close. <span class="Italic">See Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (noting that the Board should consider factors such as the length of the delay and a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune in every good cause determination, and finding that good cause existed for the appellant's two-day delay in filing his appeal); <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980) (listing "the length of the delay" among the factors considered in making a good cause determination). Therefore, we reserve judgment on the timeliness of the appellant's appeal and decide the jurisdictional question that it presents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving that her appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] .

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant responded to the administrative judge's jurisdictional show-cause order by challenging the validity of the LCA. Specifically, she argued that the precise office of the Department of Defense in which she worked at the time the LCA was executed had been "abolished" prior to her removal, and because her former office did not execute a "memorandum of agreement...to delegate authority of the LCA" to the office to which she was reassigned, the deciding official lacked the authority to remove her pursuant to the LCA. The appellant also disputed the validity of the LCA by arguing that, to her knowledge, her supervisor did not "formally" engage in the decision-making process leading to the removal action, in violation of the agency's Drug Plan. However, neither of these claims undermines the validity of the LCA, and the appellant has not shown that the agency breached the agreement in a material way or otherwise breached the agreement by acting in bad faith. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Link</span>, 51 F.3d at 1582. The appellant likewise has failed to allege that she complied with the agreement, that she did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the agreement, or that the agreement was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Hamiter</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 511, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, the appellant's arguments are unavailing since she failed to establish any of the jurisdictional factors set forth above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant waived her Board appeal rights under the LCA, and we dismiss her appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may not dismiss an appeal as untimely without determining whether an appealable action has occurred when issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are "inextricably intertwined," i.e., when resolution of the timeliness issue depends on whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable action. <span class="Italic">E.g., Brown v.

One of the circumstances in which timeliness and jurisdictional issues are inextricably intertwined is when the jurisdictional question is whether the appellant was an "employee," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, who is entitled to appeal a removal action but was not given notice of his right to appeal his termination as an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Smart v.

The agency's termination notice did not inform the appellant that he had the right to appeal his termination to the Board as a removal action. Accordingly, it was error for the administrative judge to dismiss the instant appeal as untimely filed without first determining if the appellant had established <span id="Page_875"></span>jurisdiction. The case must therefore be remanded to the regional office to resolve whether the appellant established jurisdiction.</p>

Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 7 (2005).

However, where the issues of the Board's jurisdiction and the timeliness of the appeal are inextricably intertwined, as in this case, we have found that the administrative judge must first address the jurisdictional issue before addressing the timeliness of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Delalat v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 448, &#x00B6; 9 (2006). Accordingly, because the issues of timeliness and jurisdiction are inextricably intertwined and because the record is not sufficiently developed on the timeliness issue, this appeal should not have been disposed of on timeliness grounds without first addressing jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Hanna v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6 (2006).</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tanner v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 417, 425 n.* (2003), determined that the issues of jurisdiction and timeliness were not inextricably intertwined. The timeliness issue could be independently addressed in the constructive removal case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[*]&#x2003;This does not appear to be a case where the jurisdictional and timeliness issues are "inextricably intertwined," such that the resolution of the timeliness issue depends on whether the appellant was subjected to an appealable action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Greek v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 470, 473-74 (1998) (the Board ordinarily will excuse the untimeliness of a petition for appeal if an agency should have given notice of a right to appeal but did not, and the appellant acted promptly and within allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim). Here, the appellant became aware in 1995 of his right to appeal his alleged involuntary resignation to the Board, the AJ in 1995 did not dismiss that appeal on timeliness grounds, and the record suggests that the appellant was aware of his misinformation claim at that time. Thus, it may be appropriate for the AJ to assume that the appellant was subjected to an appealable action, i.e., a 1995 involuntary resignation, and dismiss the appeal as untimely filed after the record on timeliness is developed<span class="Italic">.
