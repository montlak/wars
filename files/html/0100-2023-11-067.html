<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-68"><span class="space">a.</span> Medical Expert Opinion</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Medical opinion is most valuable if it is developed soon after the onset of the condition described in the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bibby v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 33 MSPR 88, 90 (1987). It is more reliable when the physicians who provide the reports are aware of workplace conditions and the appellant's position description. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shanley v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 494, 496 (1981). Reports issued long after the operative events may have little weight, <span class="Italic">Blaske v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 76 MSPR 164, 170 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the circumstances, we do not find Dr. Weissbourd's after-the-fact opinion of the appellant's condition during the six-year period beginning in 1984 to be probative, since it is not based on any observation of the appellant during that period, or even on a review of medical records created during that period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 467, 477-78 (1994) (a doctor's opinion about the appellant's condition that was not based on direct observation of the appellant, but that instead was based entirely on the appellant's self-reporting of his condition during a period before the doctor had even met the appellant, was entitled to "little weight"); <span class="Italic">Bibby v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 33 MSPR 88, 90 (1987) (a psychologist's opinion was not probative because it was a "mere inference" that the appellant was suffering from a disorder 15 months before he visited the psychologist). Considering the appellant's extraordinarily lengthy delay in filing, the lack of contemporaneous medical evidence covering the entire period of delay, and the fact that she was able to start her own business after she resigned, she has failed to carry her burden of showing that from 1984 until 1995 she was prevented by incompetence from discovering and pursuing her appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a medical opinion clearly establishes a necessary fact, e.g., the appellant's inability to perform work, by clear evidence that the appellant cannot perform even basic life functions, it is not necessary for the physician's statement to demonstrate a detailed understanding of the appellant's job functions for the physician to state that the appellant's condition rendered her unable to perform successfully in her position. The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 619, 627 (1996) (partially overruled by <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 313, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012), discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-11-053.html#sec4-54">Evidence in Disability Annuity Appeal; <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>; Post-Separation Evidence</a>"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the nexus between the appellant's psychological impairment and her ability to perform the specific duties of her position, the Board has stated that a physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tanious v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 107, 111 (1987). This is not a case, however, where the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement turned on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements. The medical reports of Drs. Sahandy and McDonald, which were credible and consistent with one another, confirmed the appellant's personal account as to the extent of her disability. According to these reports and her personal account, the appellant was unable to leave her home, <span class="Italic">see</span> visitors, drive, and had great difficulty managing ordinary household tasks such as cooking and doing laundry. She was also taking medication that dulled her mind, made her unable to concentrate, and shortened her attention span. Under these circumstances, it was unnecessary for her doctors to have a detailed understanding of the appellant's specific duties as a GS-13 Computer Specialist (Programmer) in order to render an opinion that the appellant's psychological condition rendered her unable to perform successfully in her position. We further note that OPM had a copy of the appellant's position description when it denied the appellant's application for disability retirement. Given the medical reports and the appellant's personal account of the effects of her psychological condition, OPM was in a position to conclude that the appellant's condition precluded her from performing her job duties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> was the subject of brief commentary in <span class="Italic">Wall v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 188, 193 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 178 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule in disability retirement cases is that an appellant's medical evidence must show how his condition affects the ability to perform specific job duties and requirements. <span class="Italic">Alford</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 536, &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Tanious v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 107, 111 (1987). Alternatively, where the medical evidence does not specifically address the job requirements, but it shows unambiguously and without contradiction that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position, the Board can draw the linkage and find the appellant entitled to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit provided its interpretation of <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> in <span class="Italic">Simpkins v. OPM</span>, 411 Fed. Appx. 323, 326 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We affirm the Board's decision, discerning no substantial departure from procedural rights or misconstruction of the governing legislation in Simpkins' legal challenge to the Board's decision. Although the Board has applied an exception to the rule that proffered medical evidence must be linked to the specific job duties at issue to show entitlement to disability retirement, that ruling was in a case where the employee provided overwhelmingly unambiguous and uncontradicted evidence that she suffered from such incapacity that she was unable to leave her home. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996). In contrast, the Board found that the medical evidence here does not suggest a complete incapacity to function effectively such that it is unnecessary to show an inability to perform specific job duties. Instead, the Board found that the evidence supported a conclusion that Simpkins' conditions were being managed through medication such that he could continue to perform his duties. This determination did not constitute a misconstruction of the governing legislation, as contemplated by the cases interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(d). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Anthony</span>, 58 F.3d at 626.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span>, the Board decided there was not a need for precise analysis of a position description in a medical opinion. <span class="Italic">Treziok v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 361, 367 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2001) (overruled or modified by <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 313, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012)), involved analysis of a disability retirement appeal and the presumption of disability that follows when an employee is removed for physical inability to perform his job:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's removal for inability to satisfactorily perform the duties of his position constitutes a rebuttable <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that he has met this requirement, which shifts the burden of production to OPM to come forward with evidence that is of sufficient weight to show that the appellant is not disabled. <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294. As a general rule, OPM may meet its burden of production under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span> by showing a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Here, the administrative judge applied this standard in noting that a physician's conclusion that an employee is disabled is persuasive only if the physician explains how the medical condition affects the employee's specific work requirements and in finding that none of the appellant's treatment providers addressed his specific work requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, though, has recognized an exception to the general rule under the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), in which the Board found that an employee's entitlement to disability retirement does not always "turn on finely tuned correlations between particular medical impairments and specific job requirements." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Specifically, where the Board is presented with the position description and with medical evidence that unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of the position, the Board may link the medical evidence to the job duties and requirements and find that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. In such circumstances, the Board may make this finding absent reference in the medical evidence to specific job duties or requirements. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2001).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was removed from her position based on her inability to perform her duties, her removal constitutes <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that she is entitled to disability retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, 996 F.2d at 294. Under <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>, the burden of production then shifts to OPM to come forward with evidence from which a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the appellant did not qualify for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 F.3d 520, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Klein v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 366, 370 (1996). OPM can meet its burden of production by demonstrating a lack of objective medical evidence providing a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to <span id="Page_1494"></span>perform specific work requirements. <span class="Italic">See Trevan</span>, 69 F.3d at 526-27. If OPM meets its burden of production, the Board then considers the totality of the evidence in deciding the disability issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 527. The appellant retains the burden of persuasion at all times to establish her entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Klein</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, there are limited circumstances under which a specific showing from OPM is not required. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 13 (2001). Under <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 619, 627 (1996), there is an exception to the rule that the medical evidence itself must show that the medical condition affects specific job duties and requirements. Where the Board is presented with the position description and with medical evidence that unambiguously and without contradiction indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties or meet the requirements of the position, the Board may link the medical evidence to the job duties and requirements and find that the appellant is entitled to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 14. In such circumstances, the Board may make this finding in the absence of reference in the medical evidence to specific job duties or requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Considering medical evidence in this way is part of the Board's role as the ultimate decision maker with the authority to independently evaluate the probative value of medical evidence in the absence of contradictory medical evidence from another source. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> <span class="Italic">Trezick</span>, and similar cases were substantially modified or partially overruled by <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 313, 2012 MSPB 11 (2012). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-11-053.html#sec4-54">Evidence in Disability Annuity Appeal; <span class="Italic">Chavez</span>; Post-Separation Evidence</a>," for <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>.] As to evaluation of medical evidence in a disability retirement case, the bottom line from <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> is, 117 MSPR at 322-23, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore overrule <span class="Italic">Bynum</span> and its progeny to the extent that they state that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> reflects an "exception" to a "general rule" that medical evidence must unambiguously and without contradiction show how the medical condition affects specific job duties or indicate that the appellant cannot meet the requirements of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has always stated that it will consider all pertinent evidence in determining an appellant's entitlement to disability retirement: objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on her ability to perform the duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dunn v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 426, 432 (1994), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 91 F.3d 169 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). However, nothing in the law mandates that a single provider tie all of this evidence together. For example, if the medical provider provides clinical findings, a diagnosis, and a description of how the medical condition affects the appellant's activities in general terms, the Board could consider that evidence, together with the appellant's subjective account of how the condition has affected her ability to do her job and her daily life, testimony or statements from supervisors, co-workers, family members, and friends, and the appellant's position description. From that, the Board could conclude that the medical condition caused deficiencies in the employee's performance, conduct, or attendance, <span class="Italic">or</span> that the medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service in her position, either because the appellant is unable to perform critical elements of her position, <span class="Italic">or</span> because she cannot work at any job, in a particular line of work, or in a particular type of work setting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ultimate question, based on all relevant evidence, is: Do the employee's medical impairments preclude her from rendering useful and efficient service in her position? And this question must be answered in the affirmative if the totality of the evidence makes that conclusion more likely to be true than not true. 
</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> notwithstanding, the Board does not lightly avoid the need for a description of a specific connection between a medical condition and the inability to work, as it explained in <span class="Italic">Newkirk v. OPM</span>, 101 MSPR 667, 673 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 119 (2006), involving evidence from the appellant that the Board stated did not unambiguously and without contradiction demonstrate that the appellant could not perform the duties of her position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Under the Board's caselaw, there are limited circumstances in which a specific showing as to how an appellant's medical condition affects her particular job requirements is not required, i.e., where the medical evidence unambiguously indicates that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 299, &#x00B6; 17 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 120 Fed. Appx. 320 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 627. Where the position description and the medical evidence unambiguously and without contradiction indicate that the appellant cannot perform the duties of the position, but the medical evidence itself does not describe how a condition affects the ability to perform, the Board will link the medical evidence to the job duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted the limitations of <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> in <span class="Italic">Reid v. OPM</span>, 246 Fed. Appx. 687, 689 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Reid argues the Board committed legal error by not applying the <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> exception to link her proffered medical evidence to the specific job duties of a mail handler to find that she is entitled to a disability retirement. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> provided overwhelmingly unambiguous and uncontradicted evidence that she suffered from such severe mental incapacity that she was unable to leave her home and was incapable of performing any of her duties at home. <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. at 627. In the present case, however, both OPM and the Board reviewed the evidence and found no evidence that Ms. Reid's condition prevented her from performing the essential duties of her position. Further, the second CA-17 form contradicts Ms. Reid's assertion that her condition was severe enough to prevent her from performing. Thus, the Board properly determined that <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard</span> does not apply. Because we find no reversible error in the Board's decision, this court affirms.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Admissible expert opinion includes evidence from psychologists offering testimony or reports concerning appellants who assert psychological illness in response to AWOL charges or who claim to lack the mental capacity necessary to enter a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v.

In other contexts, moreover, the Board will accept evidence from a clinical psychologist in evaluating an appellant's psychological condition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Krzewinski v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 353, 361-62 (1996) (the Board examined the issue of whether the appellant lacked mental capacity to enter into a last-chance settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Padilla v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 561, 565-66 (1993) (the Board analyzed whether the appellant's mental condition justified a dismissal of the appeal without prejudice).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Statements from physicians may be in the form of affidavits, <span class="Italic">Quinn v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 286, 288 (1983), but ordinarily their reports will not be sworn. A credibility analysis is not ordinarily appropriate when an AJ evaluates conflicting medical expert testimony, <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. DOJ</span>, 60 MSPR 138, 142 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant met the standards for the medical qualification as a DUSM depended on an evaluation of the medical evidence of record and expert testimony concerning his mental condition. In analyzing the testimony of the expert witnesses, the administrative judge applied the standard for resolving factual disputes and questions of credibility, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, 35 MSPR 453, 458 (1987).... This was not the most appropriate standard. It is clear from our examination of the record...that the dispute among these witnesses over the appellant's diagnosis involved a conflict of expert medical opinion rather than an argument over the basic facts of the appeal. Therefore, in assessing the probative weight of each medical opinion, the administrative judge should have considered whether the opinion was based on a medical examination, whether the opinion provided a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with the treatment of the appellant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board obliquely mentioned analysis of the credibility of experts in <span class="Italic">McCray v. DOD</span>, 68 MSPR 186, 193 n.6 (1995), involving a disability defense:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that while couched as credibility determinations, certain of the administrative judge's findings are not actually credibility determinations but, in fact, appear to be medical judgments as to the severity of the appellant's symptoms and as to what pattern of behavior could or could not result from the appellant's mental condition. We caution that the purpose of credibility determinations is to resolve factual questions in issue; such determinations may not simply reflect an administrative judge's opinion on an issue not in dispute<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text">Presented with the conflicting testimony of physicians, the Board will more likely rely on the testimony of the doctor whose involvement with the appellant has been more frequent. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Agnes v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 176, 179 (1980). <span class="Italic">Battle v. OPM</span>, 7 MSPR 422, 424 (1981), considered conflicting medical testimony and favored the evidence from physicians more familiar with appellant's condition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The probative value of medical opinions "may depend in part upon such factors as whether the opinion was based on a medical examination, whether the opinion provides a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from mere conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with or treatment of the applicant's condition." [<span class="Italic">Chavez</span>], 6 MSPR 422-24. The presiding official in the instant appeal did not have available the Board's ruling in <span class="Italic">Chavez.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the guidance of <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> and under the circumstances presented in this case, we conclude that the reports of appellant's own doctors <span id="Page_1495"></span>supporting appellant's claim of total disability have greater probative value than the report of the OPM doctor who found the appellant able to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was examined once by the OPM physician, and that single medical examination did not even culminate in a medical diagnosis. Indeed, the report of the physician noted that a diagnosis was "deferred." In contrast, the reports of appellant's doctors, based upon treatment of appellant over a period of years, evidence diagnoses of progressive arthritis particularly affecting the appellant's extremities, as well as hypertension. Moreover, these reports contain reasoned explanations for the findings and opinions of the physician which are not inconsistent with the appellant's subjective evidence of pain and inability to perform the essential functions of her position as cook. The appellant's testimony regarding her capabilities is entitled to substantial weight in light of her employment with the agency for a period of more than fifteen years. <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> 358, n.39, 6 MSPR 422, n.39.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board made the point in <span class="Italic">Bordelon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The persuasiveness of medical evidence depends upon whether it provides a reasoned explanation of how certain aspects of a particular condition render the employee unable to perform specific work requirements.... The Board has also stated that the extent and duration of an expert's familiarity with or treatment of the applicant's condition, as well as the qualifications of the expert, should be considered in evaluating the probative value of medical opinions....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">[N]one of Dr. Abrams' statements were challenged by expert testimony. Although the appellant believes that Dr. Abrams is wrong, and that his condition is under control, he has not presented persuasive evidence in support of his belief. Dr. Donaghy's unsworn statement that there are no restrictions on the appellant's employment was not subject to cross-examination and appears to be based on a single blood test of a type which Dr. Abrams testified is not the best method for evaluating the long-term control of a diabetic condition. Thus, the appellant's evidence is not of sufficient weight for us to discount the agency medical officer's sworn testimony and reasoned medical opinion that the appellant is not physically qualified to serve as a Security Guard at a military installation. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bahm v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 627, 630, 632 (1988) (in assessing the appellant's medical condition, the opinion of an agency physician who had examined the appellant and who testified at the hearing was entitled to more weight than the conclusory opinion of a private physician, where the private physician did not testify at the hearing, and where his opinion was based on a single examination); <span class="Italic">Walls v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPB 516, 10 MSPR 274, 278 (1982) (the administrative judge should not have given more weight to affidavits than to contradictory live testimony where there was no reason, such as inherent improbability or internal inconsistency, to discount the live testimony).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Schrodt v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 609, 614-15 (1998), did not credit a medical opinion with the same "considerable weight" it was given by the AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that Dr. Berg's medical opinion evidence was entitled to considerable weight because he had examined the appellant, had toured the agency's facility and had observed the employees performing their duties, and had reviewed the appellant's position description. This was error. Although Dr. Berg did tour the plant two to three years prior to his examination of the appellant, his testimony does not reflect any particularized knowledge of the appellant's duties, i.e., he stated, for example, that he had only a "vague familiarity" with what was involved in doing tie-outs. Moreover, he did not order any independent diagnostic tests in March 1996, but relied only on what was already in the appellant's medical history. Examination of the March 1996 Medical Examination and Assessment form also reveals that he performed no clinical evaluation based on a physical examination. In finding that the appellant was not fit for duty as a PTF distribution clerk, Dr. Berg admitted that his examination and opinion has not really changed from February 6, 1995. Furthermore, as previously noted, although Dr. Berg did not recall examining the appellant on November 2, 1995, he admitted that a medical report in his writing based on an examination for the same condition found the appellant fit for duty as of November 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also significant is the fact that, in each of his medical reports, Dr. Berg failed to relate the appellant's medical condition to the specific duties of the manual distribution clerk position, merely stating, in a conclusory fashion, that he believed that the appellant's condition rendered him unfit for the distribution clerk position. <span class="Italic">See Lassiter v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 60 MSPR 138, 142 (1993). In addition, he only considered whether the appellant could perform the duties of the distribution clerk position as set forth in the position description, but not whether he could perform the duties of the manual distribution clerk position to which he was assigned. He also admitted that he was not asked to determine whether modifications to the appellant's job could accommodate his disability. He testified that his instructions, in essence, were to determine whether the appellant could do all the jobs in the distribution clerk position description. The record reveals that the position of distribution clerk may encompass many duties, many of which were not required of the appellant in his position of manual distribution clerk. For example, a distribution clerk could work on the dock distributing parcels on a machine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of the inadequacies of Dr. Berg's testimony and examinations of the appellant as they relate to the appellant's actual performance of his job duties, we find his medical evidence was entitled to little probative weight.</p>
