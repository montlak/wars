<p class="Body-Text">Delayed filing may be excused under some circumstances when the appellant relies on his counsel but at the same time actively seeks to track the status of his case. <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 643-44 (1990), excused delayed filing of an appeal when an attorney's proper efforts to file were thwarted by the intentional misconduct of his own staff and when the appellant repeatedly and timely checked with the attorney's staff concerning status of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> is applied to delayed filings of PFRs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 190, 193 n.1 (1993) (excusing the late filing of a response to a PFR and cross-PFR when the respondents were properly served but the law office secretary, who was fired for disruption and incompetence, failed properly to send documents to the Board; the appellant's attorney corrected the problem immediately upon its discovery); <span class="Italic">Nolte v. DHHS</span>, 58 MSPR 44, 47 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> applies when the appellant proves that his diligent efforts to prosecute his case were, without his knowledge, thwarted by his attorney's deceptions or negligence; <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> is inapplicable when the appellant does not show that he made an effort to prosecute his case: "appellant has not shown that he made any diligent effort at all to prosecute his case, as he allowed approximately three months to lapse before allegedly inquiring about its status"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Bro v. USPS</span>, 46 MSPR 294, 296 (1990) (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>: "Ordinary diligence requires that the appellant check on the status of his [PFR] prior to the deadline rather than afterwards as is the case here."). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-108.html#sec2-106">Delay Excused; Obstruction or Misrepresentation by Counsel</a>," concerning the effect on timeliness of an appeal of deliberately misleading information from counsel or his staff, with particular reference to <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640 (1990).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the Board explained, rejecting a PFR, <span class="Italic">Soleto v. USDA</span>, 58 MSPR 253, 256 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board has found that an appellant is responsible for the errors of his representative.[2] <span class="Italic">Sofio v. IRS</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). The Board has also held that an appellant's representative has an affirmative obligation to be familiar with Board deadlines and that counsel's erroneous interpretation of a Board regulation is not a reasonable excuse for a delayed filing.... Thus, the fact that the appellant relied on his representative's advice that refiling was unnecessary does not excuse the untimely filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Board has recognized that a representative's misleading of an appellant as to the status of an appeal establishes good cause for untimely filing where the appellant exercised diligence in monitoring the progress of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 643-45 (1990). The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, however, that an appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of the appeal at all times and not to leave it entirely to his attorney. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 MSPR at 643. In this case, the appellant did not monitor the progress of the petition for review that he believed would be filed (or had been filed) on his behalf. Although the appellant contacted Mr. Sparks regarding the refiling of his petition shortly after his deficient petition was returned to him in July 1992, he waited several months before he made another attempt to track the progress of his petition. Thus, we find no basis under <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> to waive the time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Belter v. DHS</span>, DA-1221-11-0609-W-1 (NP 9/20/2013), excused a late PFR when an attorney misled the appellant concerning the status of his PFR and the appellant promptly filed his PFR once the problem was discovered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a motion on review asking the Board to waive the deadline for filing his petition for review because his then-attorney misled him into believing that he had timely filed the petition. Attached to his motion are documents concerning a bar disciplinary complaint that the appellant filed against his former attorney. In one of the documents, the appellant's former attorney admits that he forwarded the appellant a copy of a petition for review of the initial decision and advised him that he had filed that petition with the Board. The appellant claims in his motion, under penalty of perjury, that he did not learn that his former attorney never actually filed the petition for review until July 2012. The appellant then filed his petition for review <span class="Italic">pro se</span> on July 14, 2012.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1782"></span>The Board may grant or deny a waiver of a time limit for filing a petition for review after considering all of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). To establish good cause for untimely filing, the appellant has the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To determine whether the appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits, or of unavoidable misfortune which caused his inability to file his petition in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It is well settled, however, that an appellant is responsible for the errors of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981). A limited exception to this general rule exists where an appellant proves that his diligent efforts to prosecute his case were thwarted by the representative's deception and negligence. <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 640, 643-44 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Here, we find that the appellant had no reason to suspect that his then-attorney had not filed the petition for review as he had indicated. Indeed, the attorney provided the appellant with a copy of what he claimed had been filed when he informed the appellant that he had filed his petition for review, and the copy contained a signed certificate of service indicating that the petition had been timely filed. It was not until after the appellant contacted his then-attorney regarding the status of the petition for review that he learned that the petition had not been filed with Board, and the appellant filed his own petition for review shortly thereafter. Under these unique circumstances, we find that the appellant's efforts to pursue his case were thwarted by his former attorney's deception and negligence and that the limited exception therefore applies in this case. <span class="Italic">See Dunbar</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 643-44; <span class="Italic">cf. Belcher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 7 (2006) (the appellant failed to establish good cause where he failed to show that he tried to contact his attorney, who he believed was filing his petition for review on his behalf, before the filing deadline or otherwise make an effort to ensure that his petition was timely filed). Accordingly, we waive the filing deadline upon our finding of good cause for the appellant's delay in filing his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Dunbar</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 645.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Lamb v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 500, 501-03 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Lamb v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3790), the alleged neglect of an attorney did not excuse a belated PFR and <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> was distinguished when the appellant failed to promptly confirm the actions taken by counsel to actually file the PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge informed the appellant that the initial decision would become the Board's final decision on June 8, 1994, unless a petition for review was filed by that date with the Clerk of the Board. On January 26, 1995, the appellant mailed a letter to the Clerk of the Board requesting information as to the status of her case. The letter stated that she had terminated the services of the attorney who had represented her in the regional office proceeding, and that she had not been in contact with the attorney since about May 18, 1994, at which time he told her he would be appealing the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the declarations, the attorney telephoned the appellant on June 7, 1994, the day before the last day for filing a petition for review, and told her he had decided not to appeal the initial decision. After the appellant threatened to report the attorney to the state bar association, he reportedly relented and agreed to file a petition on the appellant's behalf. The appellant states that she then waited for ninety days without receiving any communication from the attorney before trying to contact him. She says she wrote the letter to the Clerk of the Board on January 26, 1995, when her phone calls and letters to the attorney remained unanswered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). A limited exception to this rule exists when an appellant has proven that her diligent efforts to prosecute her case were thwarted by her attorney's deceptions and negligence. <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 643 (1990). The Board has stated, however, that an appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of the appeal at all times and not to leave the matter entirely to the attorney. <span class="Italic">Soleto v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 58 MSPR 253, 256 n.2 (1993). The Board has found that an appellant who has allowed three months to elapse before inquiring about the status of his appeal has not shown due diligence. <span class="Italic">Nolte v. DHHS</span>, 58 MSPR 44, 47, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 16 F.3d 421 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming the truth of the appellant's declarations, she delayed for three months following the June 8, 1994 deadline before she even attempted to ascertain whether her attorney had filed a petition for review on her behalf, and then delayed more than three additional months before verifying with the Board whether such a petition had been filed. These actions do not evince the diligence in monitoring and prosecuting her appeal necessary to come within the <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> exception to the rule that appellants are responsible for the errors of their chosen representatives. We therefore find that the appellant has not established good cause for the untimely filing of her petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boyce v. VA</span>, 79 MSPR 402, 405 &#x00B6; 7 (1998), distinguishing <span class="Italic">Dunbar,</span> emphasized that delay in filing a PFR will not be excused because of a representative's neglect unless the appellant is diligent in monitoring the progress of his case (presumably to guard against his representative's neglect):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his timeliness motion, the appellant appears to contend that he was somehow prevented from previously filing the petition due to the actions or inactions of his representative below. Even assuming the truth of this contention, it does not excuse the appellant's filing delay because an appellant is bound by the errors of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). The Board has held that, where an appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal were thwarted by his representative's negligence or malfeasance, the appellant and his representative were not acting as one, and the representative's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. Department of State,</span> 60 MSPR 441, 445-46 (1994); <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 640, 643-44 (1990). Here, the record shows that the appellant was duly notified of the time limit for filing the petition for review, and his waiting more than a year after the filing deadline to check on the status of his appeal does not show that he made diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal. We therefore find that the appellant may not escape the consequences of his failure to exercise due diligence by blaming his representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Strong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 243, 246-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2000), a relatively routine inquiry to counsel's office concerning the status of the PFR due to be filed seven days later was not sufficient to avoid dismissal of a late PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 640 (1990), the Board recognized a limited exception to this rule for cases where an appellant proves that he actively monitored the progress of his appeal, but that his diligent efforts to prosecute his case were thwarted by the deception and negligence of his representative. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 643-45. This limited exception has not changed the requirement that an appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of the appeal at all times and not to leave the matter entirely to his attorney. <span class="Italic">Soleto v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 58 MSPR 253, 256 n.2 (1993). Further, an appellant's unwarranted belief that his representative is pursuing his appeal is not a proper basis for a finding of due diligence. <span class="Italic">Curry v. Department of the Navy,</span> 43 MSPR 645, 650 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant acknowledges receiving the initial decision, which apprised him of the filing deadline. He did not say when he met with Mr. Watts to discuss a possible petition for review, and he does not allege that a decision was ever made before the filing deadline to seek review of the initial decision. Although the appellant declares that he "checked with" Mr. Watts' office on December 17, he does not allege that he spoke with Watts, does not mention what he was told by the person in Watts' office to whom he spoke on the 17th, and does not claim that he attempted to contact Watts between December 17 and December 24 when the petition for review was due.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has submitted no statement from Mr. Watts elaborating on what may have been said at any time before December 24, 1999, regarding the filing of a petition for review. In addition, the appellant does not allege that he had any contact with Watts in the 19-day period between December 17, 1999, and January 5, 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> requires a greater degree of diligence on the part of the appellant in the prosecution of his appeal than has been shown here. In <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the appellant checked repeatedly on the status of his appeal before the filing deadline, attempted to mail the appeal himself and was hampered in his efforts by a deliberate act of defiance on the part of his attorney's secretary. <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 43 MSPR at 644.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant in this appeal does not allege that his representative actively deceived him or thwarted his diligent efforts to prosecute this appeal. Rather, he asserts that he and Mr. Watts discussed a petition for review sometime before December 17, and that he called Watts' office only one time after that conversation, not to inquire about the status and progress of a petition for review, but simply to see if he needed to do anything else. As stated above, the appellant does not identify the person in Watts' office to whom he spoke on December 17, and what that person told him. Further, if in fact the appellant did not speak to his lawyer on December 17, he has not claimed that he made any further attempts to contact Watts after December 17 and before the deadline for filing a petition for review. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant did not make diligent and repeated efforts to monitor the progress of his appeal, and that he has not established sufficient grounds to overcome the well established rule that an appellant is responsible for <span id="Page_1783"></span>the mistakes of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 41 MSPR 35, 37 (1989); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Winey v. DOD</span>, DC-0432-12-0839-I-4 (NP 8/10/2016) ("The appellant was a registered e-filer and was properly served with all of the documents in his case, as he now concedes. Therefore, he was on notice that the deadline for refiling his appeal was 180 days from the date of the initial decision. He implicitly seems to contend that he did not refile himself because he relied on his counsel to refile for him. However, the appellant does not claim, and there is no evidence, that he affirmatively monitored the progress of his appeal rather than merely waited to be informed of the next step. <span class="Italic">Belcher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 7 (2006). Therefore, the appellant has not shown that his diligent efforts to prosecute his appeal were thwarted, and has not established sufficient grounds to overcome the well-established rule that an appellant is responsible for the mistakes of his representative."); <span class="Italic">Belcher v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 58, 61 &#x00B6; 7, 2006 MSPB 10 (2006) ("Although the appellant submitted his own sworn statement, he did not submit any corroborating evidence or show that he tried to contact his attorney before the filing deadline or otherwise made any effort to ensure that his PFR would be timely filed. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant did not make diligent and repeated efforts to monitor the progress of his appeal, and that he has not established sufficient grounds to overcome the well-established rule that an appellant is responsible for the mistakes of his chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Strong v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 243, &#x00B6; 11 (2000); <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 667, 670 (1981).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Less than persistent tracking of the preparation of a PFR by another appellant was the basis for the Board's refusal to waive the deadline for a PFR that was to be filed by the appellant's counsel, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 235, 237-39 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's subsequent petition for enforcement was denied by the administrative judge in a compliance initial decision issued on December 16, 1994, that notified the appellant that it would become final on January 20, 1995, unless a petition for review was filed by that date or the Board reopened the case on its own motion. The appellant filed a petition for review on March 31, 1995, stating, in pertinent part, that his attorney failed to file a "motion for an appeal within the time limit." In a statement signed under penalty of perjury, the appellant asserted that he became very concerned after waiting for more than a month to hear from his attorney, and that he contacted the attorney by telephone and was told to be patient. The appellant also stated that after another month passed, he talked to a union steward who advised him to call the administrative judge, and that the administrative judge informed the appellant that his case was closed and that a "Motion for Review" had not been filed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, an appellant is responsible for the action or inaction of his chosen representative.... The Board has held, however, that in the interest of justice, it will not apply this principle when a designated representative misrepresents, either intentionally or through negligence, that an appeal had been filed, and the appellant is otherwise diligent in prosecuting his appeal. <span class="Italic">See generally Dunbar v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 640, 643-45 (1990). Here, the appellant does not allege that he was unaware of the time limit for filing a petition for review and he did not contact his attorney until more than a month had elapsed, apparently after the compliance initial decision was issued. Further, the appellant waited another month before speaking to a union steward and thereafter calling the administrative judge. The appellant, however, has not specified when such contacts were made and the date he was actually advised that a petition had not been filed. Nor has the appellant submitted statements from his attorney or the union steward, a disinterested individual who is not identified, regarding the date and the nature of the conversations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, therefore, are not persuaded by the appellant's unverified statements that he exercised ordinary prudence under the circumstances, or that he made an attempt to monitor his appeal before the time limit had expired, in that he waited "more than a month" to hear from his attorney. The appellant's unwarranted reliance on his representative, while failing to take any action on his own in the face of his knowledge of the filing deadline, does not show due diligence. <span class="Italic">See Shavers v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 187, 190-91 (1992). Even if the appellant's attorney told him to be "patient," the appellant has not established that he was actively misled or deceived into believing that a petition for review had been timely filed at that time. Further, the single contact with the attorney after waiting for more than a month, does not indicate that the appellant diligently monitored his appeal, particularly since he was, or should have been, aware of the time limit. Even if some delay may have been excusable under the circumstances, the appellant has not established good cause for the two-month delay. <span class="Italic">See Curry v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 645, 650 (1990) (an appellant has a personal duty to monitor the progress of the appeal at all times and not to leave it entirely to his attorney). Thus, we find no basis under <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> to waive the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant must bear the responsibility of the failure to file a timely petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Turner v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 37, 39 (1993) (inadequate representation does not constitute good cause for waiver of filing limits); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 2 MSPB 93, 1 MSPR 683, 690 (1980) (the right of appeal is personal to appellant, who is responsible for its prosecution and development). Moreover, mere negligence on the part of the appellant or his representative does not constitute good cause for a late filing. <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 39 MSPR 515, 518 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Small v. GSA</span>, 88 MSPR 187, 192 &#x00B6; 9 (2001) ("An appellant...has a personal responsibility to monitor the progress of his appeal at all times, and not to leave the matter entirely in the hands of his representative. [A]bsent a specific showing of diligent monitoring, the appellant cannot blame his representative's negligence in seeking to excuse a filing delay."); <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. DCA</span>, 88 MSPR 46, 49 &#x00B6; 5 (2001) (unavailability of a representative was not good cause for late a PFR when the appellant did not assert that he contacted his representative before the initial decision became final); <span class="Italic">Summers v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 403, 405-06 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2000) (delay was not excused because the attorney wrote the appellant a letter misstating the PFR due date; the attorney had not accepted the appellant as a client; the initial decision plainly stated the date; counsel's letter was dated after the due date; the appellant did not claim confusion as to due date; the appellant did not attempt to contact the attorney during the month between the due date and the date of counsel's letter); <span class="Italic">Edmundson v. DOJ</span>, 73 MSPR 267, 271 (1997) (appellant could not gain a waiver of the PFR filing deadline due to a representative's alleged neglect or misconduct, for the appellant "has failed to make a specific showing of diligent monitoring efforts"); <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 69 MSPR 695, 699 (1996) (Although the facts suggested neglect by the attorney entrusted with filing a PFR, a belated filing was not excused when there was "no indication that the appellant diligently pursued the filing of her petition for review. She has not alleged that she contacted her attorney regarding the progress of her petition for review and that her attorneys thwarted her efforts at filing the petition.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant inquires of the status of a PFR that he believes to have been filed by counsel and learns that it was not filed, the appellant must act promptly if the delay is to be excused despite counsel's negligence; further delay of two and a half months is not excusable neglect for the appellant who understands his plight and what he must do to correct it. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 15 MSPR 365, 367 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 431, 433 (1988) (fifteen months of delay was not excused despite the appellant's allegations that she was misled by her attorney and that her attorney also failed to return repeated telephone calls concerning the status of her case). Although a portion of the delay may be excused, e.g., through the time that the petitioner obtains counsel after serious health problems affecting the appellant, further extended delay would not be waived without good cause. <span class="Italic">Cardinali v. Dept. of Army</span>, 43 MSPR 414, 415-16 (1990) ("While a majority of this delay apparently was caused by the attorney, the appellant is responsible for the inaction of the representative.... The appellant's wife's failure to assure filing during this lengthy period is a failure to act with reasonable diligence and ordinary prudence under the circumstances.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 83 MSPR 519, 522-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8-9 (1999), reemphasized the need for an expeditious PFR once an appellant learns that counsel did not timely file:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant filed her petition for review more than 14 months after the March 11, 1998 time limit. In her response to the notice, the appellant alleges that she filed her petition in May 1999, after she retained new counsel, because that is when she first learned that an initial decision had been issued in her appeal. According to the record, the appellant designated her current attorney to represent her in this appeal on October 8, 1998. The appellant, however, provides no explanation for the delay of more than 7 months from the date that she designated her current counsel and the date that she filed her petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her timeliness motion, the appellant appears to contend that she was somehow prevented from previously filing the petition due to the actions or inactions of her representative below. She asserts that she did not receive any communication from her attorney below that a decision had been issued in her appeal. She contends that her former attorney misrepresented to her about when a hearing would be held in her case and this prevented her from realizing when an initial decision would be issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an appellant's diligent efforts to prosecute her appeal were thwarted by her representative's negligence or malfeasance, the appellant and her representative were not acting as one and the representative's negligence or malfeasance should not be attributed to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, 60 MSPR at 445-46. Even if we were to accept the appellant's claim that, in February 1998, her attorney lied by stating that he was waiting for a hearing date after he had already withdrawn her request for a hearing, it would not excuse the amount of time that she allowed to elapse after she first allegedly learned of the status of her appeal and the time that she filed the instant petition. <span class="Italic">See Green v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 131, 133 (1988). According to her affidavit, the appellant first learned of the initial decision when she retained new counsel on or before <span id="Page_1784"></span>October 8, 1998. Yet, although experienced in Board procedures, counsel waited another 6 months before taking any action before the Board. The appellant is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">Sofio v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 7 MSPB 493, 7 MSPR 667, 670 (1981). Accordingly, we dismiss the appellant's petition as untimely filed.</p>
