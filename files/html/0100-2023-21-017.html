<h6 class="h6" id="sec14-17"><span class="space">(i)</span> Abandonment of Civilian Career for Military Service</h6>
<p class="Body-Text">The complexities of service credit for a period of active guard reserve service that separated periods of civilian employment as a National Guard civilian technician under the 1974 Veterans Reemployment Rights Act and the 1994 USERRA were explored in <span class="Italic">Kiszka v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 109, 116 &#x00B6; 15 (2003), allowing no service credit for the period of active guard reserve duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of his more recent separation from civilian employment, the appellant was 55 years of age. Because his separation was involuntary, he would be entitled to an immediate annuity if he had at least 25 years of service at that time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d). As noted above, however, the appellant is not entitled to credit for his AGR service. Moreover, as we also have indicated above, he withdrew his retirement contributions after his 1984 separation from civilian employment. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(d)(1) and 8342(a), such an action generally terminates an employee's right to any future retirement annuity based on the service covered by those contributions. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 32 (2003). Finally, although the appellant may receive credit for this service when he otherwise becomes entitled to an annuity, the service cannot satisfy the basic requirements for entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's analysis was confirmed, <span class="Italic">Kiszka v. OPM</span>, 372 F.3d 1301, 1302-08 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka served in the United States Army from August 1965 through January 1966. He then served as a civilian technician in the Massachusetts Army National Guard ("MANG") from August 1972 through November 1984. In November 1984, Mr. Kiszka separated from MANG to enter full-time National Guard duty in the Active Guard/Reserve ("AGR"). Mr. Kiszka does not dispute that he was terminated from MANG and that he neither requested nor was given a leave of absence. Shortly after enrolling in AGR, Mr. Kiszka withdrew the contributions he had paid into CSRS during his tenure with MANG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka served in AGR from November 1984 to May 1994, at which time he was re-appointed as a civilian technician in MANG. MANG characterized his 1994 appointment as a reemployment pursuant to the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act ("VRRA"), 38 U.S.C. Chapter 43. After his appointment, Mr. Kiszka did not make a redeposit of the CSRS contributions he had previously withdrawn. Mr. Kiszka continued to work in MANG until 1999 when he reached age 55. At that time, he retired after being involuntarily separated from the National Guard upon reaching the mandatory retirement age and time in rank. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 14506, 14513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly before his retirement, Mr. Kiszka filed an application for CSRS benefits. He claimed that he had a total of more than 27 years of federal service (four months in the Army, almost 10 years in AGR, and almost 18 years in MANG). OPM made interim annuity payments to Mr. Kiszka for two years, but eventually denied his application in February 2002. OPM then demanded that Mr. Kiszka repay the $54,966 in interim annuity payments that it had made while his application was under consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM denied Mr. Kiszka's application for retirement for several reasons. Pertinent to this appeal, OPM first determined that Mr. Kiszka's service in AGR was not creditable toward his retirement. According to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13), creditable military service "does not include service in the National Guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the United States or full-time National Guard duty...if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38." OPM determined that Mr. Kiszka's return to service with MANG was not a reemployment because he was not on a leave of absence from MANG when he served in AGR but instead was separated. Thus, according to OPM, Mr. Kiszka's time in AGR did not "interrupt[&#8197;] creditable civilian service...," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13). OPM further determined that, even though MANG characterized Mr. Kiszka's return as a reemployment, "[a]n erroneous action by an agency cannot create a right to benefits to which an individual would otherwise not be entitled." OPM also ruled that by obtaining a refund of the contributions he made to CSRS while he was employed by MANG, Mr. Kiszka negated his eligibility for retirement benefits based on the time covered by the refund. OPM concluded that "the statute governing civil service refunds [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a)] bars credit for periods of service covered by a refund unless an employee returns to Federal employment and renews eligibility to receive civil service benefits based on a subsequent separation."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On Mr. Kiszka's request for reconsideration, OPM affirmed its initial decision. OPM reiterated that Mr. Kiszka was not entitled to be treated as having been reemployed by MANG because he was separated from MANG rather than being on a leave of absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka appealed OPM's decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The administrative judge who was assigned to the case reversed OPM's decision. The administrative judge ruled that there was no evidence that Mr. Kiszka intended to make a permanent career of his active duty service in the National Guard or "in any manner [made] an affirmative waiver of his reemployment rights under the VRRA." Moreover, even though Mr. Kiszka did not take a leave of absence from his civilian position, the administrative judge ruled that "once a person meets the criteria for reemployment following military service, as [Mr. Kiszka] has here, the agency must consider him to have been on furlough or leave of absence during the period of military duty." In a footnote, the administrative judge added that Mr. Kiszka is entitled to credit for his previous civilian service even though he did not redeposit his earlier retirement contributions when he was reemployed. In such a case, the administrative judge stated, his annuity would be actuarially reduced based upon his age and the redeposit due at the time of his retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM appealed the administrative judge's decision to the full Board, which reversed. The Board ruled that Mr. Kiszka was not entitled to reemployment with MANG after his service in AGR because when he left <span id="Page_4112"></span>MANG he did not request a leave of absence. The Board concluded that "the plain language of [38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d) (1974)] expressly conditioned the employee's right to be returned to civilian employment, under Title 38, on his having requested leave from his employer." The Board addressed Mr. Kiszka's argument that such a request would have been futile based on National Guard policy and concluded that "even if one or more government officials misinformed the appellant about the procedures to follow when leaving his civilian employment to begin his AGR service, any such misinformation would provide no basis for finding that the appellant is entitled to be treated as though he had requested and obtained leave," since "the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the claimant was denied monetary benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official." The Board noted that OPM did not challenge the administrative judge's decision that, if Mr. Kiszka is otherwise entitled to annuity, he is entitled to receive credit for his service during the time for which he received a refund of his contributions. Nevertheless, the Board concluded that "[u]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(d)(1) and 8342(a), such an action generally terminates an employee's right to any future retirement annuity based on the service covered by those contributions." The Board noted that it was not addressing OPM's argument that Mr. Kiszka forfeited his reemployment rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of a career in the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka petitions this court for review of the full Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka argues that he was entitled to reemployment with MANG after his service in AGR, even though he did not request or receive a leave of absence from MANG prior to enrolling in AGR. The pertinent statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;An employee who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;is separated from the service involuntarily, except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">after completing 25 years of service or after becoming 50 years of age and completing 20 years of service is entitled to an annuity....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka argues that, because he was involuntarily separated from MANG and he was over 50 years old when he was separated, he is entitled to an annuity if he completed 20 years of service. Mr. Kiszka asserts that if his 10 years in AGR and almost 18 years in MANG are all credited, he has completed more than 27 years of federal service. OPM responds that Mr. Kiszka's time in AGR should not be counted toward the requirement of 20 years of service, because it was not followed by "reemployment" in MANG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c), military service may be creditable toward a CSRS annuity. Under 35 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13), however, the definition of "military service" does not include "service in the National Guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the United States or full-time National Guard duty...if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38." If Mr. Kiszka's AGR service interrupted creditable civilian service and was followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38, then his AGR service would fall within the definition of "military service" and would be creditable toward his annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Mr. Kiszka sought reemployment in May 1994, his reemployment rights are governed by the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1578 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-27 (1988)) ("VRRA").1 Section 2024(d) of the VRRA governed Mr. Kiszka's reemployment rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;Any employee not covered by subsection (c) of this section who holds a position described in clause (A) or (B) of section 2021(a) <span class="Italic">shall upon request be granted a leave of absence by such person's employer for the period required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty training in the Armed Forces of the United States.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Upon such employee's release from a period of such active duty for training or inactive duty training,...such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as such employee would have had if such employee had not been absent for such purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Such employee shall report for work at the beginning of the next regularly scheduled working period after expiration of the last calendar day necessary to travel from the place of training to the place of employment following such employee's release, or within a reasonable time thereafter if delayed return is due to factors beyond the employee's control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Failure to report for work at such next regularly scheduled working period shall make the employee subject to the conduct rules of the employer pertaining to explanations and discipline with respect to absence from scheduled work....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d) (1988) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that section 2024(d) requires that an employee request a leave of absence before that employee is entitled to reemployment rights. Mr. Kiszka disagrees, arguing that the words "shall upon request be granted a leave of absence" were intended as a restriction on the employer rather than as a requirement of the employee. We have held, however, that the language of section 2024(d) requires that an employee seeking entitlement to reemployment must first request a leave of absence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is incontrovertible that the first task in interpreting a statute is to look to its express language. In this case, the language "upon request" in Section 2024(d) can only mean that, barring an emergency or other special circumstances in which the country needs to call up its reserves, an employee must request, i.e., ask for, a leave of absence to attend reserve duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Ellermets v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 916 F.2d 702, 705 (Fed. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka argues that decisions of this court and others suggest that an employer cannot abrogate an employee's right to reemployment by terminating the employee. In <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 258 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001), we noted that the Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">King v. St. Vincent's Hospital,</span> 502 U.S. 215, 112 S. Ct. 570, 116 L. Ed.2d 578 (1991), characterized section 2024(d) of the VRRA as involving a "congressionally mandated leave of absence." Mr. Kiszka also argues that the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Kolkhorst v. Tilghman,</span> 897 F.2d 1282, 1286 (4th Cir. 1990), characterized the language of section 2024(d) as "unequivocal and unqualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases Mr. Kiszka cites do not support the proposition that an employee who does not request a leave of absence may nevertheless be entitled to reemployment. In <span class="Italic">King</span> the Supreme Court did not discuss the requirements that an employee must meet to establish reemployment rights in the first place. Rather, the Court addressed whether an employee who would otherwise be entitled to reemployment rights can waive the right to reemployment by spending too much time on active duty. The Court decided that the employee, who had requested a leave of absence, did not waive his reemployment rights after spending three years in AGR. The Court reasoned that section 2024(d) "places no limits on the length of a tour after which [an employee] may enforce his reemployment rights...." <span class="Italic">King,</span> 502 U.S. at 222.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> we addressed the issue of abandonment of reemployment rights in light of <span class="Italic">King.</span> In deciding that Mr. Woodman's multiple tours in AGR over 14 years indicated an abandonment of his reemployment rights in favor of a career in military service, we explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The fact that Mr. Woodman never gave his employer a formal letter of resignation...is not determinative of whether Mr. Woodman had a "career" in the military. Instead, Mr. Woodman's actions created a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> resignation by indicating to PNG that he never intended to return to his civilian position. Mr. Woodman was separated from his NGT position in 1981, and he did not seek reemployment with the PNG as an NGT until nearly fourteen years later in 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1378-79. Instead of supporting Mr. Kiszka's position, the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Woodman</span> suggests that a resignation can result in a loss of reemployment rights. Nor does <span class="Italic">Kolkhorst</span> support Mr. Kiszka's position. In <span class="Italic">Kolkhorst,</span> the Fourth Circuit addressed a different issue--whether, once an employee requests a leave of absence for active reserve training, the employer is free to refuse the request. 897 F.2d at 1286. Thus, <span class="Italic">Kolkhorst</span> does not address the scope of the employee's reemployment rights when the employee has not made a leave request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka also argues that the legislative history of VRRA's successor statute, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, Pub.L. 103-353, 108 Stat. 3149 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-33 (1994 &#x0026; Supp. II 1996)) ("USERRA"), supports his position. In particular, Mr. Kiszka points to the House Report on the 1994 Act, which stated that the purpose of section 4315(b) of that Act was to "reaffirm that a departing service person is to be placed on a statutorily-mandated military leave of absence while away from work, regardless of the employer's policy. Thus, terminating a departing service person, or forcing him or her to resign, even with a promise of reemployment, is of no effect." H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 33 (1994), reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2466. The quoted material from the legislative history does not address whether section 2024(d) requires that an employee request a leave of absence as a condition of being entitled to reemployment rights. Rather, it simply recognizes that an employer cannot circumvent an employee's right to reemployment through a policy of denying leaves of absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board noted several differences between section 2024(d) of the VRRA and sections 2024(a)-(c) that further suggest that section 2024(d) requires an employee to request a leave of absence. First, sections 2024(a)-(c) do not include the language "shall upon request be granted a leave of absence." Second, sections 2024(a)-(c) include limits on the amount of time an employee can spend in military service before losing the right to reemployment. In <span class="Italic">King,</span> the Supreme Court noted that difference and explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4113"></span>Thus, &#x00A7; 2024(a) currently gives enlistees at least four years of reemployment protection, with the possibility of an extension to five years and even longer. Again, for example, &#x00A7; 2024(b)(1) extends protection to those entering active duty (except for "the purpose of determining physical fitness [or] for training") for at least four years, with the possibility of a further extension beyond that. Given the examples of affirmative limitations on reemployment benefits conferred by neighboring provisions, we infer that the simplicity of subsection (d) was deliberate, consistent with a plain meaning to provide its benefit without conditions on length of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">502 U.S. at 220-21. The Court's reasoning suggests that we should infer from the presence of the language "shall upon request be granted a leave of absence" in section 2024(d), and its corresponding omission from sections 2024(a)-(c), that Congress deliberately added the requirement of requesting a leave of absence in cases governed by section 2024(d). Moreover, as the Board noted, section 2024(d) includes a requirement, not present in sections 2024(a)-(c), that employees on leaves of absence must report promptly to their employers upon completion of the military service, and that failure to do so would have consequences. Thus, the statute does not contemplate that an employee is automatically granted a leave of absence without the need to request one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kiszka asserts that in 1984 the National Guard's policy was to separate employees entering AGR rather than grant them leaves of absence, and that he did not request a leave of absence because it would have been futile to do so. OPM responds that even if a government official had misinformed Mr. Kiszka regarding his right to a leave of absence, the government cannot now be estopped from denying Mr. Kiszka reemployment rights. <span class="Italic">See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 419-20, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990) ("[E]quitable estoppel will not lie against the Government as against private litigants. In <span class="Italic">Lee v. Munroe &#x0026; Thornton,</span> 11 U.S. 366, 7 Cranch 366, 3 L. Ed. 373 (1813), we held that the Government could not be bound by the mistaken representations of an agent unless it were clear that the representations were within the scope of the agent's authority."); <span class="Italic">see also Schism v. United States,</span> 316 F.3d 1259, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). A National Guard policy of refusing requests for leaves of absence (rather than just the misstatement of a government official) might, in some circumstances, merit a finding that such a request would be futile. However, Mr. Kiszka provides no evidence, other than his assertions, that MANG had such a policy at the time of his separation and that it applied that policy in his case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, Mr. Kiszka has not shown that he was entitled to reemployment with MANG, and consequently he has not shown that his AGR service interrupted creditable civilian service. He has therefore not shown that he is entitled to a CSRS annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d). Because Mr. Kiszka cannot show that he had 20 years of service apart from his time in AGR, we need not address whether the withdrawal of his retirement contributions precludes crediting the time covered by those contributions. Nor do we reach the question whether, under <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 258 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001), Mr. Kiszka forfeited his reemployment rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of a career in the military.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim similar to that presented in the <span class="Italic">Kiska</span> case was reviewed and rejected in <span class="Italic">Corkery v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 118, 121-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16 (2003) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Corkery v. OPM</span>, 151 Fed. Appx. 966 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c), military service may be creditable toward a CSRS annuity. "Military service," for purposes of this and other sections in subchapter 83-III of title 5, U.S. Code, "does not include service in the National Guard <span class="Italic">except when ordered to...full-time National Guard Duty...if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter 43 of title 38 that occurs on or after August 1, 1990</span>...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM does not deny that the appellant's service as a civilian technician prior to his separation in September 1985 was creditable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(a), (e) (military technician in National Guard "is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States"). It also does not deny that this service was interrupted when the appellant was ordered to full-time National Guard Duty; and, as indicated above, the appellant resumed his civilian service after August 1, 1990. OPM argues, however, that the appellant was not entitled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 43 to reemployment following his AGR service, that he therefore was not reemployed "in accordance with" that chapter, and that his service accordingly is not creditable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331(13) and 8332.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until 1994, reemployment rights such as those at issue here were set forth in provisions enacted under the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1578 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-27) (VRRA). <span class="Italic">See Woodman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 258 F.3d 1372, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2001). On October 13, 1994, Congress enacted USERRA, which modified those rights. The provisions of USERRA generally are applicable to reemployments that were initiated on or after December 12, 1994. USERRA, Pub. L. No. 103-353, &#x00A7; 8(f), 108 Stat. 3149, 3176 (1994); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> MSPB Docket No. BN-831M-97-0035-R-1, &#x00B6; 25 (July 11, 2003) (<span class="Italic">Parker II</span>) (<span class="Italic">reversing Parker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 16 (2002) (<span class="Italic">Parker I</span>)). Because the appellant did not return to civilian employment until 1997, his entitlement to reemployment is governed by USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA provision addressing reemployment rights of persons such as the appellant imposes a limit of 5 years on the length of the military service preceding the reemployment. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4312. Time served in the military prior to December 13, 1994, however, does not count toward this limit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.203(b) (1997); <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1378. The appellant's reemployment rights therefore are not barred by any specific statutory time limit. Our reviewing court has held, however, that USERRA, like VRRA, applies only to noncareer military service, and it has indicated that a person may be found to have "waived his reemployment rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military." <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1377-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the administrative judge noted that the Department of Defense (DoD) had promulgated regulations defining "[n]on-career service," for purposes related to civilian reemployment rights, as excluding "[c]ontinuous or repeated active uniformed service or full-time National Guard duty that results in eligibility for a regular retirement from the Armed Forces..."; he found that the appellant's military service "did not and could not result in eligibility for a regular retirement from the Armed Forces" because the appellant began his active military duty too late--i.e., at the age of 47--to complete the 20 years of active duty required for military retirement; and he therefore concluded that the appellant had not abandoned his reemployment rights for a military career. ID at 10 (quoting 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 104.3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by this reasoning. Nothing in the DoD regulation on which the administrative judge relied indicates that only service entitling the employee to military retirement can constitute noncareer military service. Service providing this entitlement is mentioned only as an example of noncareer service. 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 104.3. Moreover, the court in <span class="Italic">Woodman</span> indicated that other factors could be significant in determining whether an employee abandoned his civilian career in favor of a military career. For example, it indicated that evidence that the employee had actively sought service extensions was important; it referred to the employee's "serv[ing] continuously and repeatedly for fourteen years as a full-time member of the AGR"; and it stated that it concurred in the Board's statement that the employee's "multiple and successive title 32 AGR tours...would seem to indicate that [he] elected to make a career with the military." <span class="Italic">Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1378-79.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the appellant served in the AGR continuously for more than 12 years--nearly as long as the service at issue in <span class="Italic">Woodman.</span> It also is apparent that he extended his absence from his civilian position by serving multiple tours of active duty. (SF-50 indicating that appellant had "employment rights...for 4 years under Chapter 353, FPM"). Furthermore, the appellant remained on AGR duty until only a few months before his separation from the National Guard Reserve--a separation that he must have known would require the termination of the only civilian federal employment he had ever had. In addition, we see no indication that the appellant sought or obtained other civilian federal employment in lieu of retiring, or that he had any intention of doing so when he requested reemployment in his civilian position. Instead, he applied for a retirement annuity before his scheduled separation, as noted above; he made a deposit in the retirement fund to cover his military service; he expressed his willingness to redeposit the funds he withdrew from his retirement account when he left his civilian position in 1985;[6] and he has indicated that he took the actions he took in order to obtain a civil service retirement annuity. These circumstances indicate that the appellant returned to his civilian technician employment in order to receive a CSRS annuity, and not in order to resume the civilian career he had left more than a decade earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As OPM has noted, an employee's withdrawal of CSRS retirement contributions could be regarded as a further indication that the employee did not intend to resume his civilian federal career. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8334(d)(1) and 8342(a), such an action generally terminates an employee's right to any future retirement annuity based on the service covered by those contributions; and, in <span class="Italic">Paisley v. City of Minneapolis,</span> 79 F.3d 722, 725 (8th Cir. 1996), a withdrawal such as this was regarded as "clearly indicating [the employee's] understanding that he had terminated his [civilian] employment and moved on to another career." In light of the other circumstances on which we rely, however, we see no need to determine whether the appellant's withdrawal of retirement contributions is an additional indication that the appellant intended to abandon his civilian federal career. (appellant's statement that he withdrew retirement contributions in order to obtain a return on his funds that would exceed the interest he would be required to <span id="Page_4114"></span>pay when he redeposited them, and that the funds "were to be paid back to the retirement system when I was restored to technician status").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant also was separated from his position in 1985, before beginning his AGR. At the time of that separation, employees such as the appellant were entitled, under VRRA, to request leave during their absences to perform AGR service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2024(d) (1974). There is no indication in the record that the appellant made such a request. Furthermore, while the record does not show that the appellant requested that he be separated, it also includes no indication that he challenged that action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When considered in isolation, some or perhaps even each of the individual factors described above could be regarded as insufficient to support a finding that the appellant waived his USERRA rights. In <span class="Italic">Lemmon v. County of Santa Cruz,</span> 686 F. Supp. 797, 799, 804-05 (N.D. Cal. 1988), the employee was found not to have waived his rights despite his agreement to extend his tour of active military duty. That case, however, did not involve all the circumstances present here. For example, the employee in <span class="Italic">Lemmon</span> requested only a single, 1-year extension of his active duty; he was absent from his civilian employment for a total of only about 4 years; he requested leave from that employment instead of resigning; and, when his active duty was extended, he informed his civilian employer of the extension and asked that his leave from his civilian position be extended as well. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 799. Perhaps more important, <span class="Italic">Lemmon</span> was issued by a court other than our reviewing court; it accordingly constitutes only persuasive authority; and its holding is not binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">See Fairall v. Veterans Administration,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In our view, the circumstances present in the case now before us, when considered together, are comparable to those our reviewing court has found sufficient to constitute a waiver of reemployment rights. <span class="Italic">See Woodman,</span> 258 F.3d at 1374-79. We find, therefore, that the appellant waived his USERRA rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military. Accordingly, the appellant is not entitled to service credit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(13).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the appellant's application for, and receipt of, his CSRS retirement contributions following his separation in 1985 bar OPM from crediting the service covered by those contributions toward any CSRS annuity unless the appellant redeposits those contributions while employed in a position subject to CSRS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a). Apparently, if the appellant had redeposited those contributions between the time he was appointed to his civilian position in December 1997 and the time he was separated in May 1998, he could have again obtained credit for this service. He did not do so, however, and, as a result, his only creditable service is his service from December 1997 through May 1998. This service does not satisfy the statutory requirement that a CSRS annuity be based on at least 5 years of creditable civilian service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a). It also does not satisfy the requirement that, during the 2 years before the separation on which the retirement claim is based, the employee complete at least 1 year of creditable service in a position subject to CSRS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's result was in turn affirmed, <span class="Italic">Corkery v. OPM</span>, 151 Fed. Appx. 966 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As seen above, the decision of the Board sustaining OPM's reconsideration decision was based upon two determinations. First, the Board held that Mr. Corkery 's AGR service was not creditable service for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8332(c). Second, the Board ruled that Mr. Corkery's civilian service prior to September of 1985 was not creditable service for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Corkery does not challenge the Board's holding with respect to his AGR service. Rather, he acknowledges in his reply brief that affirmance of that part of the Board's decision is compelled by our decisions in <span class="Italic">Dowling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1260 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and <span class="Italic">Moravec v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 393 F.3d 1263 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Corkery does contend, however, that his pre-September 1985 civilian service should be creditable for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8333(a). He does not dispute that he never made a redeposit of his retirement contributions relating to his pre-September 1985 civilian service during the brief period between December of 1997 and May of 1998 when he was reemployed by MAARNG. Rather, as he did before the Board, he argues that the reason he did not make the redeposit was because he was misinformed by MAARNG that "he did not have to make the redeposit because he was otherwise eligible for an annuity based on his MAARNG reemployment." As he also did before the Board, he urges that, in view of the fact that he was given incorrect information by his employing agency, he should be allowed to make the redeposit now and thereby become eligible for a retirement annuity based upon his pre-September 1985 service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board rejected this argument. In so doing it stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">While the appellant's receipt of, and reliance on, such misinformation would of course be most unfortunate, it does not provide a proper basis on which to credit the service at issue despite the failure to make the redeposit, and it does not provide a proper basis on which to pay the appellant an annuity to which he is not entitled under the law. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Mgmt. v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434, 110 L. Ed. 2d 387, 110 S. Ct. 2465 (1990) (the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the claimant was denied monetary benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">94 M.S.P.R. 118 (2003). We see no error in the Board's decision on this point. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span> stands as a clear bar to Mr. Corkery's claim that he should be allowed to redeposit his pre-September 1985 retirement contributions, even though the time allowed in the statute for doing so has passed. <span class="Italic">See Deerinwater v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 78 F.3d 570, 573 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (finding <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> barred an employee from filing an application for disability retirement outside the one year period allowed by statute even though the agency misinformed the employee about the filing deadline). Furthermore, unlike in <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 413 F.3d 1339, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2005), there is no suggestion here that the agency failed to comply with a regulatory obligation to notify Mr. Corkery of his opportunity to redeposit his retirement contributions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">William E. Woodman petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") that denied his appeal of the decision of the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") that found him ineligible for reemployment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-353, 108 Stat. 3149 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4333 (1994 &#x0026; Supp. II 1996)) ("USERRA"). We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Woodman joined the federal civilian workforce as a National Guard Technician ("NGT") with the Pennsylvania National Guard ("PNG") in July of 1976. Prior to that time, he had completed six years of active duty military service. Five years later, in July of 1981, Mr. Woodman left civilian service as an NGT and voluntarily accepted an appointment to a two-year tour of duty as a member of the Active Guard Reserve ("AGR") with the PNG. Mr. Woodman's appointment was pursuant to 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 502(f) (1994). He entered the AGR at the rank of Major. In June of 1983, Mr. Woodman agreed to an extension of his AGR tour of duty until May 31, 1986, another three years. In April of 1986, he again extended his AGR tour of duty, this time until September 30, 1990. Finally, in 1990, he agreed to extend his AGR tour of duty indefinitely. On February 1, 1995, the Adjutant General of Pennsylvania notified Mr. Woodman that he would be involuntarily separated from his AGR position effective June 30, 1995, because as of that date he would have completed 20 years of active duty service. On June 30, 1995, Mr. Woodman was separated from the AGR and retired from the military at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Since that date, he has been receiving retirement benefits as a retired military officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 30, 1995, Mr. Woodman filed a written request with the Adjutant General seeking to exercise reemployment rights under USERRA as an NGT. On June 8, 1995, the Adjutant General denied Mr. Woodman's request, finding that reemployment would be impossible and unreasonable because of his military retirement status. On November 1, 1995, Mr. Woodman attempted to invoke reemployment rights under USERRA by requesting that OPM place him in a position comparable to his NGT position in another federal agency, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4314(d) (1994). OPM denied Mr. Woodman's request in a letter dated January 29, 1996, stating that he was not eligible for mandatory placement under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4314(d) because he was a career member of the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In due course, Mr. Woodman requested assistance from the Department of Labor's Veterans Employment and Training Services ("VETS"), pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4321 (1994) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.210 (1997), which provide for VETS assistance with respect to employment and reemployment rights for any veteran who requests assistance. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4322(a)(2)(B) (1994), VETS filed a complaint against OPM with the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC"). Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4324(a)(2)(A) (1994), OSC is authorized to provide legal representation to a person seeking federal reemployment under USERRA if it determines that OPM erred in denying the person reemployment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 29, 1998, OSC notified OPM that it was contemplating legal action before the Board in Mr. Woodman's case, and it invited OPM to supply it with an opinion on the matter. In response, OPM provided its analysis of the situation, explaining that it did not believe that Mr. <span id="Page_4115"></span>Woodman qualified for reemployment under USERRA because of his career in the military. OPM stated that Mr. Woodman's voluntary acceptance of continuous and successive AGR tours of duty, as well as his voluntary retirement from the military, established a career in the uniformed service, disqualifying him for reemployment rights under USERRA. Following review of OPM's response, OSC concluded that Mr. Woodman had abandoned his civilian position in favor of a career in the military, thereby waiving his right to reemployment in the federal civilian workforce. Therefore, on November 6, 1998, OSC informed Mr. Woodman that it would not prosecute his case before the Board. Following receipt of OSC's letter, Mr. Woodman timely appealed to the Board without VETS' assistance, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4324(b)(4) (1994) ("A person may submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management under this subchapter directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board if that person has received a notification of a decision from the Special Counsel [declining representation].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following a hearing, the administrative judge to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision sustaining OPM's denial of Mr. Woodman's USERRA claim. <span class="Italic">Woodman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, PH-3443-99-0075-I-1 (M.S.P.B. May 28, 1999). The administrative judge determined that Mr. Woodman's entitlement to reemployment rights under USERRA depended upon whether his 14 years of AGR duty constituted career or non-career military service. The administrative judge denied Mr. Woodman's appeal because she concluded that "the record as a whole supports a conclusion that the appellant's service was career service and his arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. "The administrative judge's initial decision became the final decision of the Board on June 30, 2000, when the full Board denied Mr. Woodman's petition for a hearing for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.115(d) (1999). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 1994, reemployment rights for veterans were set forth in the provisions of the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-508, 88 Stat. 1578 (codified as amended at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2021-2027 (1988 &#x0026; Supp. III 1991)) ("VRRA").[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, 103rd. Cong. 2d Sess. 18, reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2451. VRRA ensured that a person desiring to perform military service shall upon request be granted a leave of absence by such person's employer for the period required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty training in the Armed Forces of the United States. Upon such employee's release from...[duty], such employee shall be permitted to return to such employee's position with such seniority, status, pay, and vacation as such employee would have had if such employee had not been absent for such purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;VRRA was re-codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4307 (Supp. IV. 1992) in October of 1992. Pub. L. No. 102-568, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 506(a), 106 Stat. 4320. For the sake of clarity and to avoid confusion with the codification of USERRA, we will cite to the pertinent sections of VRRA in accordance with the pre-1992 codification.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2024(d) (1988). When considering USERRA, Congress stated that VRRA "safeguard[ed] employment and reemployment rights in civilian employment of members of the uniformed services." H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 at 18, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2451.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, Congress initiated a review of the efficacy of VRRA. In light of its review, Congress enacted USERRA "to clarify, simplify, and where necessary, strengthen the existing veterans' employment and reemployment rights." H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 at 18, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2451. Congress stated that revisions of VRRA were necessary because "[a]lthough the law has effectively served the interests of veterans, members of the Reserve Components, the Armed Forces and employees, the current statute is complex and sometimes ambiguous, thereby allowing for misinterpretations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The purposes of USERRA are set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The purposes of this chapter are--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services by eliminating or minimizing the disadvantages to civilian careers and employment which can result from such service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;to minimize the disruption to the lives of persons performing service in the uniformed services as well as to their employers, their fellow employees, and their communities, by providing for the prompt reemployment of such persons upon their completion of such service; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3)&#x2003;to prohibit discrimination against persons because of their service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should be a model employer in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301 (1994). USERRA is intended to apply to those serving on active duty and active duty for training. It also covers full-time National Guard duty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303(13), (16) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reemployment rights under USERRA are available for any person who can meet the criteria of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]ny person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services shall be entitled to the reemployment rights and benefits and other employment benefits of this chapter if--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I.&#x2003;the person (or an appropriate officer of the uniformed service in which such service is performed) has given advance written or verbal notice of such service to such person's employer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">II.&#x2003;the cumulative length of the absence and of all previous absences from a position of employment with that employer by reason of service in the uniformed services does not exceed five years; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">III.&#x2003;...the person reports to, or submits an application for reemployment to, such employer...&#8197;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312(a) (Supp. II 1996).Section 4314(d) is the provision of USERRA which covers individuals who satisfy the basic requirements set forth in 4312(a) and who served in a civilian capacity as NGTs prior to entering into military service. Section 4314(d) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the adjutant general of a State determines that it is impossible or unreasonable to reemploy a person who was a National Guard Technician employed under Section 709 of Title 32, such person shall, upon application to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, be ensured an offer of employment in an alternative position in a Federal executive agency on the basis described in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4314(d) (1994). As seen above, it was pursuant to this provision that Mr. Woodman sought employment in the federal civilian workforce after he was told that he would not be reemployed by the PNG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In enacting USERRA, Congress stated that "[n]ew section 4301 of title 38 would state that the purpose of chapter 43 is to encourage noncareer service in the uniformed services....The Committee intends this section to be helpful to courts construing the statute. Although current law does not contain an express statement of purpose, the Committee believes that the principles enunciated in new section 4301 have served as a basis for the VRR law since its beginning in 1940." S. Rep. No. 103-158, 103rd Cong. 1st. Sess., 40 (1993); <span class="Italic">see also</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65 at 18, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2460 ("employment and reemployment rights are intended to protect non-career service persons" regardless of active or non-active duty). We conclude that Congress intended both VRRA and USERRA to apply only with respect to non-career military service. Decisions under VRRA are not inconsistent with this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">King v. St. Vincent's Hospital</span>, 502 U.S. 215 (1991), the employee sought a three-year leave of absence from his employment to take a full-time appointment with the National Guard. The employer denied the request and sought a declaratory judgment that the request was unreasonable. The Supreme Court held that it would not read a "reasonableness" limit on the length of a 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2024(d) leave after which the employee would be entitled to reemployment. 502 U.S. at 222. In other words, the Court determined that there was no durational limit imposed on a "leave of absence" from employment under VRRA's &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2024(d). Therefore, King, who requested a three-year leave of absence from his employer, was entitled to reemployment rights upon his return to his civilian position under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2024(d). The Court referred to VRRA as involving a "congressionally mandated leave of absence" from a civilian position. 502 U.S. at 220. In<span class="Italic"> Paisley v. City of Minneapolis</span>, 79 F.3d 722 (8th Cir. 1996), the court determined that VRRA's reemployment rights did not extend to an employee who served in the military for over fourteen consecutive years. 79 F.3d at 725. The court in <span class="Italic">Paisley</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">King</span> by noting that, while there was no durational requirement under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2024(d), there still could be a waiver of reemployment rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The <span class="Italic">Paisley</span> court found that the employee had waived his reemployment rights by expressly resigning from his civilian position before completing his military service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because he had abandoned his civilian career for a career in the military, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 725 n.5, the employee had waived his VRRA reemployment rights. The court stated: "[T]here is a legally significant distinction between an intent to take a true leave of absence from civilian employment, the length of which is not subject to a reasonableness standard, and an intent to make the military a career, which suggests a choice to forsake one's civilian job and any reemployment rights attached thereto." 79 F.3d at 725 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Woodman recognizes that, in order to be eligible for reemployment rights under USERRA, a person must be absent from his civilian job due to military service for a period of less than five years. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312(a)(2) (Supp. II 1996). He argues, however, that, because the provisions of USERRA took effect December 12, 1994, his reemployment rights did not expire until December 12, 1999. Therefore, his reemployment rights must be defined under VRRA up to and including December 12, 1994. VRRA, Mr. Woodman asserts, "places no limit on the length of a tour after which [an individual accepting a title <span id="Page_4116"></span>32 AGR appointment] may enforce his reemployment rights against [his employer]." <span class="Italic">King</span>, 502 U.S. at 222. According to Mr. Woodman, because he applied for reemployment in 1995, well within the five-year limit, OPM erred in denying him USERRA reemployment rights under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that Mr. Woodman's reemployment rights did not expire until December 12, 1999. Mr. Woodman's reemployment rights up to and including December 12, 1994 are defined by VRRA. OPM's own regulation states that time served in the military prior to December 13, 1994, will not count in computing the five-year limitation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.203(b) (1997). However, as noted above, VRRA, like USERRA, only applied to non-career military service. The question before us then is whether the Board's conclusion that Mr. Woodman's AGR duty was career military service is supported by substantial evidence. We conclude that it is.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's finding that Mr. Woodman had abandoned his federal civil service career for a military career is supported by substantial evidence because Mr. Woodman waived his reemployment rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of one in the military. Mr. Woodman served continuously and repeatedly for fourteen years as a full-time member of the AGR. His service resulted in his eligibility for a regular retirement from the military. Importantly, the record indicates that he actively sought service extensions. As the Board stated, Mr. Woodman's "multiple and successive title 32 AGR tours...would seem to indicate that [he] elected to make a career with the military."[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although not binding for purposes of VRRA, USERRA's definition of non-career military status is instructive in understanding Mr. Woodman's position in the military. For purposes of USERRA, the Department of Defense defines non-career military service as: The period of active uniformed service required to complete the initial uniformed service obligation; a period of active duty or full-time National Guard duty that is for a specific purpose and duration with no expressed or implied commitment for continued active duty; or participation in a Reserve component as a member of the Ready Reserve performing annual training, active duty for training or inactive duty training. Continuous or repeated active uniformed service or full-time National Guard duty that results in eligibility for regular retirement from the Armed Forces is not considered non-career service. 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 104.3 (1997). Mr. Woodman's participation in the military was "continuous" and "repeated," because he was eligible for and received military retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Mr. Woodman never gave his employer a formal letter of resignation, as did the employee in <span class="Italic">Paisley,</span> is not determinative of whether Mr. Woodman had a "career" in the military. Instead, Mr. Woodman's actions created a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> resignation by indicating to PNG that he never intended to return to his civilian position. Mr. Woodman was separated from his NGT position in 1981, and he did not seek reemployment with the PNG as an NGT until nearly fourteen years later in 1995. Substantial evidence supports the Board's finding of career service.</p>
