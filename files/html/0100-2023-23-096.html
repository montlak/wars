<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-95"><span class="space">2.</span> Postal Service Employee</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1993, the Board attempted to straighten out the impact of the law and regulations governing the obligation, if any, of employees to seek outside employment during the pendency of Board appeals from Postal Service removals. The Board ruled that, as to appeals by preference eligibles, Postal Service employees would be subject to the same rules governing appeals from employees of other agencies, <span class="Italic">Andress v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 501, 505-10 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A prevailing appellant's entitlement to back pay when the Board reverses an action which resulted in loss of pay is generally governed by the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596. Under the Act, as the administrative judge noted, the improperly removed employee is not required to seek replacement employment while his administrative appeal is pending, and the duty to seek such employment arises only when the removal is administratively affirmed. <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d at 264; 62 Comp. Gen. 370, 372-73 (1983); Federal Personnel Manual, Supplement 990-2, Book 550, Subchapter S8-7c(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrington v. United States Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 415, 419 n.2 (1991). However, as a result of the Postal Reorganization Act (PRA), the Postal Service is not an "agency" for purposes of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">White v. Bloomberg</span>, 501 F.2d 1379, 1381 n.2 (4th Cir. 1974). At the same time, a provision of the PRA, 39 USC 1005(a)(2), preserves the existing rights of preference eligible employees of the Postal Service. As explained below, we believe the agency's purpose in revising ELM Part 436.425 was to modify the right to back pay upon correction of a personnel action. Therefore, this case requires us to decide the effect of this change on back pay claims by preference eligible Postal Service appellants in light of section 1005(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to May 1, 1989, ELM Part 436.425 required a statement of reasons why outside employment was not obtained and a resume of efforts to secure other employment only when the back pay period exceeded one year. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. US Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR at 407. The former ELM provision appears to reflect a since-deleted regulation under the Back Pay Act which stated that if the employee was restored within one year after his erroneous separation, the agency could not delete any period from its back pay computation based on failure to seek other employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 550.804(f) (1977). Both provisions suggested that a duty to seek other employment arises after one year, perhaps based on an estimate of the time ordinarily needed to pursue administrative relief. The Back Pay Act regulation was amended in 1977 to delete not only the one-year exclusion but any specific reference to setoffs for failure to seek other work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d at 264 n.4. In contrast, the revised Postal Service regulation deletes the one-year exclusion but retains the requirement that the claimant account for failure to seek replacement employment. In its new form, ELM Part 436.425 extends this requirement to all parts of the back pay period in which no work was obtained. We believe that in amending Part 436.425 the agency changed the meaning of "reasonable efforts" in Part 436.22 to require employees to seek replacement employment immediately upon removal. In doing so the agency has established a different rule for its employees from the rule concerning mitigation of damages applicable to federal employees generally. Thus, this case requires us to decide whether ELM Part 436 can be applied to wrongfully removed Postal Service preference eligibles like the appellant to obligate them to seek replacement employment while pursuing their appeals to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The PRA established the Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch. 39 USC 201. In other provisions, the PRA excluded the application of laws dealing with federal employment in general and, while making chapter 75 of title 5 applicable, authorized negotiated and regulatory exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC 410(a) and 1005(a)(1). However, an exception was made for preference eligibles in 39 USC 1005(a)(2). This subsection states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The provisions of title 5 relating to a preference eligible (as that term is defined under section 2108(3) of such title) shall apply to an applicant for appointment and any officer or employee of the Postal Service in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the applicant, officer, or employee were subject to the competitive service under such title. The provisions of this paragraph shall not be modified by any program developed under section 1004 of this <span id="Page_4901"></span>title or any collective-bargaining agreement entered into under chapter 12 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The amendment to the Senate bill from which section 1005(a)(2) derives was introduced by Senator Hartke, who explained that its purpose "was to clarify and maintain all of those rights which veterans presently enjoy under existing law." 116 Cong. Rec. 22337 (1970). It is evident from the language and history of the statute that the PRA does not deprive preference eligibles in the Postal Service of the rights guaranteed them under the Veterans Preference Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bredehorst v. United States</span>, 677 F.2d 87, 89 (Ct. Cl. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These rights included entitlement to restoration with back pay upon correction of an adverse action under section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 387, 390, by the Board's predecessor, the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wittner v. United States</span>, 76 F. Supp. 110 (Ct. Cl. 1948); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. United States</span>, 108 F. Supp. 608, 610-12 (Ct. Cl. 1952)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 39 Comp. Gen. 639 (1960). The right of preference eligibles to back pay conferred by the Veterans Preference Act was later included in the broader right granted by the Act of June 10, 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-623, 62 Stat. 354, which extended entitlement to back pay also to individuals in the classified service who were unjustifiably removed or suspended for the efficiency of the service and to any person who was erroneously removed or suspended in a reduction in force. This Act and the back pay provision in the Security Act of 1950, Pub. L. No. 81-733, 64 Stat. 476, were later superseded by the Back Pay Act of 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-380, 80 Stat. 94, which was enacted to consolidate authorities for awarding back pay to employees subjected to unjustified personnel actions. S. Rep. No. 1062, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. 1-3 (1966); H.R. Rep. No. 32, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1-2 (1965)[;] U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News p. 109.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the history of section 1005(a)(2) makes it plain that the statute's purpose was to preserve the existing rights of preference eligible employees. The right to back pay upon correction of an unwarranted personnel action was among those rights. Thus, despite the provisions of the PRA having the effect of excluding the Postal Service as an agency from coverage by the Back Pay Act, we conclude that the Back Pay Act is a provision of title 5 relating to preference eligibles which, because of section 1005(a)(2), continues to apply to preference eligible employees of the Postal Service.[5] We also find that, when preference eligible employees are involved, the Postal Service cannot alter the rules developed by judicial construction of the Back Pay Act, including those concerning the duty of a wrongfully discharged employee to mitigate damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 580-81, 98 S. Ct. 866, 869-70, 55 L. Ed.2d 40 (1978) (when a new enactment incorporates a provision of a prior law, Congress is presumed to be aware of and to adopt the judicial interpretation given the incorporated provision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In light of this conclusion, we overrule <span class="Italic">Frazier v. US Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 584 (1985), and its progeny to the extent these decisions hold that the Back Pay Act is inapplicable to preference eligible employees of the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The duty to mitigate was initially derived by the Court of Claims from the language of one of the Back Pay Act's predecessor statutes, the Security Act of 1950, providing for deduction from the back pay award of the employee's "net interim earnings":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he clearest implication...is that it was contemplated that the claimant would make a reasonable effort to secure other employment and that the amount which the claimant earned, or with reasonable effort might have earned, be deducted from the total amount of compensation that would otherwise be paid under the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Schwartz v. United States</span>, 149 Ct. Cl. 145, 147, 181 F. Supp. 408 (1960). However, in <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, the court concluded that the plaintiff had reasonable grounds for not making an effort to secure other employment while seeking administrative relief because "[h]is time was undoubtedly taken up in the effort to secure favorable action by the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 148. The court therefore required an offset only for the period between the final administrative decision and the plaintiff's reinstatement following a court decision in another case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication in the legislative history of the Back Pay Act that Congress intended to change this rule. As noted above, the history indicates that the Act was intended as "perfecting legislation," and it cites as applicable decisions under the predecessor Act of June 10, 1948, concerning what constitutes employment giving rise to interim earnings that must be offset. H.R. Rep. No. 32 at 2, 6. By using in the Back Pay Act language similar to that in the predecessor 1950 Act construed by the Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span>, Congress can be presumed to have intended to carry forward the rule that an appellant need not search for employment while his appeal is pending. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. at 580-81, 98 S. Ct. at 869-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing the Back Pay Act, the Court of Claims continued to follow the rule enunciated in <span class="Italic">Schwartz</span> and to reiterate the rationale stated there for the rule--that the wrongfully discharged employee reasonably spends his time on his appeal. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Urbina v. United States</span>, 192 Ct. Cl. 875, 428 F.2d 1280, 1287 (1970) (back pay will not be denied for failure to work during period when employee's time is reasonably consumed in prosecuting appeals from his discharge); <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d at 264 (employee was not required to seek other employment while endeavoring to obtain reinstatement through administrative appeal). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 62 Comp. Gen. 370, 372 (1983) (employee appealing removal was not required to accept agency offer of temporary employment while appeal to Board was pending because he would no longer have the time to adequately prepare for any hearings contesting the agency's action). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Bloomberg</span>, 501 F.2d at 1381 n.3 (a wrongfully discharged employee cannot reasonably be expected to seek alternative employment immediately and is justified in spending his time pursuing administrative relief). In this case, the appellant is a preference eligible who was reinstated to his position as a result of a favorable initial decision in his appeal. He seeks back pay for a period of about four and one-half months during which he was pursuing his appeal to the Board. Under the Back Pay Act, as construed by the cited decisions, the appellant was not required to seek replacement employment during this period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address the agency's alternative basis for denying the appellant back pay, but we find that its denial of back pay under Part 436.23 is completely without foundation. The appellant's statement that he was unavailable for other work while pursuing his appeal is, of course, not an admission that he was not ready, willing and able to work in his postal position, and there is no other basis in the record for such a finding. Accordingly, we find that the appellant is entitled to back pay for the entire period from February 27 to July 11, 1989.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Andress</span> was reaffirmed on an OPM reconsideration petition in <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 652, 661 (1994) (tracing history of Back Pay Act). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 1, 3 (1993) (following <span class="Italic">Marshall v. GPO</span>, 45 MSPR 62 (1990)) (remedy for preference eligible employee: the Back Pay Act does not require a discharged employee to seek other employment while the appellate administrative proceedings are in progress and the employee is endeavoring to seek reinstatement). <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 383, 390-93 (1996) (reiterating that a preference eligible postal employee's back pay is computed under the Back Pay Act; for other postal employees, back pay is computed under the Employee and Labor Relations Manual). <span class="Italic">Rivas</span> summarized pertinent portions of the ELM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision of the ELM that governs back pay for postal service employees is section 436. Under ELM &#x00A7; 436.11, a postal service employee</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">is entitled to receive back pay for the period during which an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action was in effect which terminated or reduced the basic compensation, allowances, differentials, and employment benefits which the employee normally would have earned during the period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 436.12 goes on to say that "[f]or purposes of entitlement to employment benefits, the employee is considered as having rendered service for the period during which the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action was in effect." Employee benefits, as referred to in &#x00A7; 436.11, include annual leave (&#x00A7; 512), sick leave (&#x00A7; 513), and holiday leave (&#x00A7; 518). A back pay award should also include premium, differential and overtime pay (&#x00A7; 434). Overtime hours and night differential are determined by the average of the number of hours assigned to other employees in the same employment status during the back pay period<span class="Italic">. McDonough v. United States Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 129 (1993); ELM &#x00A7; 436.411(a). Interest on a back pay award must be calculated based on the Federal Judgment Rate (&#x00A7; 436.63). Therefore, we conclude that the settlement agreement required restoration to the appellant of the employee benefits which he would have received absent his constructive suspension: back pay; annual leave; sick leave; holiday leave; premium, differential and overtime pay; and interest on the back pay award.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The underpinnings of <span class="Italic">Andress</span> were questioned but not overruled in a decision involving a counsel fee petition in court under the Back Pay Act for a preference eligible in <span class="Italic">Erickson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Andress v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 501 (1993), the Merit Systems Protection Board held that "the Back Pay Act is a provision of title 5 relating to preference eligibles which, because of section 1005(a)(2), continues to apply to preference eligible employees of the Postal Service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 508. Accordingly, the Board held that a preference eligible employee of the Postal Service is entitled to back pay under the Back Pay Act following the reversal of an adverse action on appeal to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Andress</span> did not address the right to an attorney fee award. But the Board's ruling that the Back Pay Act is a provision "relating to a preference eligible" would lead to the conclusion that a Postal Service preference eligible would be entitled to an attorney fee award under the attorney fee provision of that Act. However, the Board's analysis in that regard is far from airtight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In earlier decisions the Board ruled that under Postal regulations, there was no requirement to do so for up to a year following removal. The Board expressly <span id="Page_4902"></span>left open the question as to other cases and other employees, citing <span class="Italic">Power v. United States</span>, 597 F.2d 258 (Ct.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective March 15, 1997, the agency demoted the appellant from his position of Supervisor, Customer Services, EAS-16, in Boca Raton, Florida, to the position of Part-time Flexible Distribution Clerk, PS-05, in Deerfield Beach, Florida, based on a charge of improper conduct. On appeal, the Board found that the agency had proven its specification of falsification of a government document, but not the specification of improperly taking sick leave during a period when he engaged in outside employment, and mitigated the penalty to a 30-day suspension<span class="Italic">. House v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 MSPR 138 (1998)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this enforcement action alleging that the agency had not provided all of the back pay to which he was entitled. The agency supplied evidence that it had provided back pay during periods in which the appellant was in an approved leave status, but it denied back pay for the remainder of the time in question on the ground that the appellant was not "ready, willing, and able" to perform the duties of his position, citing the fact that the appellant had not reported for duty since March 8, 1997. The appellant agreed that he was unable to work at the Postal Service, but asserted that his condition (major depression) was the result of the agency's wrongful personnel action. Finding that the agency had produced "concrete and positive evidence" that the appellant did not meet the "ready, willing, and able" requirement under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, the administrative judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument showing that he was ready, willing, and able to work between March 16, 1997, and October 27, 1998. The appellant did not respond to that order, and the AJ issued an initial decision finding that the appellant had failed to show that he was ready, willing, and able to work during the time periods in dispute, and that he was therefore not entitled to back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant reiterates his contention that his inability to work was the result of the agency's personnel action, and that this should entitle him to back pay for the periods in question. The appellant has also submitted new evidence on review--a decision by the Office of Federal Employees' Compensation finding that the appellant's depression was work-related and that his claim for benefits should therefore be accepted. In its response, the agency contends that the appellant's evidence is not new and material. It also contends that the AJ erred in adjudicating the appellant's claim under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's entitlement to back pay is governed by the Employee and Labor Relations Manual, not the Back Pay Act</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that non-preference-eligible employees in the Postal service are covered by the provisions of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), not by the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596<span class="Italic">. Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 383, 389-91 (1996); <span class="Italic">Andress v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 501, 505-08 (1993). In its response to the petition for review, the agency points out that the appellant is not a preference-eligible employee as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2108. The agency is therefore correct that the appellant's claim is governed by the ELM, not the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant does not meet the requirements for entitlement to back pay under the ELM</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ELM and the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations contain several common requirements. Both provide for back pay which the employee would have earned but for an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action," both contain a "ready, willing, and able" requirement, and both provide that there must be a causal nexus between the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and the resulting loss of pay<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596 and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.805(c) <span class="Italic">with</span> ELM &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 436.11, 436.23. The ELM additionally requires, however, that the employee have made "reasonable efforts to obtain other employment."[1] ELM &#x00A7; 436.22. Earnings from such outside employment are offset against the amount of back pay due. ELM &#x00A7; 436.21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;By contrast, the Board has held that a preference-eligible postal employee covered by the Back Pay Act is not required to seek employment while pursuing an administrative remedy. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 64 MSPR 652, 657 (1994); <span class="Italic">Andress</span>, 56 MSPR at 508-09.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 184 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 1999), our reviewing court construed the Back Pay Act and OPM's implementing regulation, concluding that an agency is liable for back pay if the employee can prove that his inability to work was the result of a personnel action that was adjudicated to be unjustified or unwarranted<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1372. We assume, without deciding, that the decision by the Office of Federal Employees' Compensation establishes the required causal nexus between the agency's demotion action and the appellant's depression. If this holding is applicable to cases governed by the ELM, it would excuse the appellant's inability to work at the Postal Service during the back-pay period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would not, however, excuse the appellant from making reasonable efforts to obtain other employment during this period or from reporting outside income. We find that the appellant's statements relating to the remaining applicable requirements of the ELM preclude him from any additional award of back pay. In a declaration made under penalty of perjury (on PS Form 8038), the appellant stated that he had no earnings from other employment during the back-pay period <span class="Italic">and that he did not seek other employment during the back pay period</span>.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We attach no significance to the appellant's testimony at the hearing that he was still working part-time at a tavern because he needed the income. He testified that he had worked at the tavern part-time at night sporadically for four years. There is no indication that this was an enlarged part time employment to replace his Postal Service employment, within the meaning of ELM &#x00A7; 436.21, and, in any event, such earnings would only be relevant as a possible offset if the appellant were entitled to back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant's statements that he did not seek work during the back-pay period preclude any entitlement to back pay under the ELM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the Board will give deference to a judge's determination of whether a postal employee made sufficient efforts to find replacement work or generate replacement earnings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson v.

The ELM requires non-preference eligible employees to file a Form 8038 titled, "Employee Statement to Recover Back Pay," describing their efforts to seek employment. Where, as here, the back pay period exceeds six months, the ELM directs that, excluding the first 45 days after the effective date of their removal, the employees must have sought work and must provide documentation they made reasonable efforts to do so while awaiting the outcome of their Board appeal.").</p>
