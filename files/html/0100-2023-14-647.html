<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-648"><span class="space">D.</span> PERSONNEL WHO CONDUCT APPRAISALS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals designating particular individuals or supervisors within the agency who will evaluate work performance of employees are outside the duty to bargain. They interfere with the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 FLRA 1051, 1052-55 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-100 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Submarine Support Facility</span>, 56 FLRA 268, 271-72 (2000) (Proposal 8, precluding evaluation by given supervisor, and Proposal 21, requiring the first level supervisor to be active participant in rating, were nonnegotiable as interfering with management's right to assign work); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1332 and Dept. of Army, Army Materiel Command, Alexandria</span>, 47 FLRA 1357, 1361 (1993) (proposal nonnegotiable that set rank of military personnel who rate civilian employees); <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 23 (1993) (Provisions 3 and 4: word "normally" did not save from determination of nonnegotiability proposals for specific levels of management officials to prepare and approve appraisals). <span class="Italic">But cf</span>. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 220</span>, 65 FLRA 638 (2011) (no fault with arbitration award, considered under the "abrogation" standard, interpreting contract to preclude more than one management official from participating in mid-year performance discussions; agency retained authority to choose any official to conduct discussion).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not negotiable that designated the supervisor of an employee to be the one who evaluated his work performance. The proposal interfered with the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 2910 and Library of Congress</span>, 18 FLRA 241, 243-44 (1985) (Proposal 4); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1345 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson</span>, 48 FLRA 168, 175 (1993) (Proposal 3 nonnegotiable: requiring meeting with and rating by supervisor for midterm appraisals); <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-144, FUSE and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 484-85 (1990) (Proposal 8, nonnegotiable: that activity head designees will rate employees for and approve quality step increases and performance awards); <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 12 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Birmingham</span>, 36 FLRA 70 (1990) (proposals nonnegotiable, as to reorganization of office, that designated particular person who could, and particular person who could not, perform appraisal; appropriate arrangement issue not presented or decided); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1798 and VAMC, Martinsburg, W.Va.</span>, 27 FLRA 239, 245 (1987) (Proposal 3 nonnegotiable: requiring that supervisors perform appraisal-related duties that they would not otherwise perform); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 943 and Dept. of Air Force, Keesler AFB</span>, 16 FLRA 313 (1984) (nonnegotiable: proposal that required appraisal to be conducted by supervisors at employees' worksites; proposal specified the personnel within the agency who would evaluate work performance).</p>
<p class="noindent">A provision that precluded "examiners-in-charge," unit members, from rating the work of other unit members was inconsistent with the right of the agency to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3385 and Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd., Dist. 7, Chicago</span>, 7 FLRA 398, 402 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714, 744-45 (1987) (Proposal 12 nonnegotiable, designating supervisory levels who would rate nurses). Nonnegotiable was a proposal that required the appraising official to be one grade higher than the employee being rated and that required the appraiser to have consistently monitored the employee's work performance. The proposal interfered with the agency's right to assign work. It was immaterial that the provision restated existing agency guidelines, for it had the effect of precluding the agency from changing the scheme during the life of the agreement. <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point</span>, 38 FLRA 149, 159-62 (1990) (Provision 2). A proposal was nonnegotiable that precluded quality reviews conducted by peers from being used in the appraisal process. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Louisville</span>, 39 FLRA 1169, 1169-70 (1991) (Proposal 1); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4041 and DHHS, SSA, Albuquerque Teleservice Ctr.</span>, 45 FLRA 3, 14 (1992) (Provision 3 nonnegotiable, precluding unit employees from evaluating data used as to other employees in appraisals); <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals and DHHS, SSA, Dist. Office, Warren</span>, 47 FLRA 1304, 1305 (1993) (restrictions on using results of peer review was nonnegotiable procedure). Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 803-08 (1991), was Proposal 9, requiring management to increase the number of reviewers as it increased the number of samples of employees' work that management reviewed. The provision was outside the duty to bargain. It interfered with management's right to determine the number of employees assigned to a work project. It was not a negotiable arrangement because of the speculative nature of the benefits accruing to employees. A section of a proposal was nonnegotiable that management disclose to the union the amount of time taken by supervisory reviewers in the examination of employees' work. <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 814 (1991) (Proposal 13). The proposal was deemed not to concern unit employees' conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Summarizing the law concerning proposals seeking to designate who will conduct appraisals, FLRA determined to be nonnegotiable Proposal 1 in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union and NLRB</span>, 42 FLRA 1305, 1306, 1308-11 (1991), that: "If management designates any Regional Office manager as an employee's appraising official, the employee's reviewing official for purposes of an appraisal shall be at an organizational level above the Regional Office." It was a violation of management rights and an inappropriate arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that employees who act as appraising officials in the regional offices include first-line supervisors, assistant office managers, office managers, deputy regional attorneys, assistants to regional directors, and regional attorneys. It is uncontroverted that regional directors perform the higher-level review function. The record also shows that regional directors are at a higher level in the Agency's organization than any of the employees--supervisors and managers--who act as appraising officials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the appraisal function in regional offices is performed by individuals who occupy positions at a lower level in the offices than regional directors.&#x2003;Proposal 1 requires that the reviewing official be at an organizational level above the regional office if an employee's appraising official is a regional office manager. Because regional directors are at a higher level than the individuals performing the appraisal function, but are employed in the same offices as those individuals, Proposal 1 would preclude the Agency from assigning the review function to regional directors. Conversely, the proposal would require the Agency to assign the reviewing function to officials at an organizational level above the regional offices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that preclude management from assigning particular functions to particular individuals directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.... Because Proposal 1 would preclude the Agency from assigning the reviewing function to regional directors, we conclude...that the proposal directly interferes with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the proposal does not directly interfere with management's right to assign work because it simply reflects procedures that permit the Agency, consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.206(c), to determine the level at which higher-level review will be performed. Even if the regulation permits management to determine the level at which higher-level review will be performed, as the Union claims, the proposal would still not constitute a negotiable procedure. As we held above, because the proposal would dictate that management assign the reviewing function to an organizational level outside of the regional office and, thus, would preclude management from assigning this function to regional directors, the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. A proposal that directly interferes with a management right does not constitute a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that Proposal 1 constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To determine whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must determine whether the proposal is (1) intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, we look to "the effects or foreseeable effects on employees which flow from the exercise of those rights, and how those effects are adverse." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 31. The Union contends that the proposal "seeks to negotiate...appropriate arrangements" for employees whose appraisals are reviewed by a higher-level reviewing official in the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that, under the current appraisal process, "various appraising officials tailor their assessments" of an employee's performance to that of the reviewing official--the regional director.... Based on the Union's statement, we find that the Union intends the proposal to ensure a more objective review of employee appraisals by requiring that the reviewing function be performed at an organizational level above the regional office. We conclude that, as such, the proposal is intended to constitute an arrangement for employees who might be adversely affected if appraisal and review were confined to the regional office level. However, we find that Proposal 1 excessively interferes with management's right to assign work. The proposal constitutes an absolute prohibition of the designation of the regional director as the reviewing official. Even assuming that Proposal 1 may benefit employees by ensuring that review takes place above the regional office, we find that benefit is outweighed by the absolute prohibition on the exercise of management's right. Consequently, we conclude that Proposal 1 does <span id="page_1090"></span>not constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent">A proposal involving a process for review of appraisals by the EEO office was nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">NWSEA and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA</span>, 63 FLRA 450 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 8</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NOAA Office of Civil Rights will compile and review the summary ratings given to employees within each affected bargaining unit at the following intervals:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a) Within 90 days of the end of the first performance rating cycle of the 5-Tier performance system, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b) every two years thereafter, within 90 days of the end of the performance rating cycle, and/or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c) in any year prior to the implementation of a RIF.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The findings will be shared with the Union.&#x2003;If the review determines that members of protected classes as defined by rule, law or regulation are disparately impacted by the 5-tier rating system, all employees within that affected bargaining unit will receive the same RIF credit (12 years), regardless of their summary rating.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">NWSEA</span>, 63 FLRA at 453:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disputed portion of Provision 8 would require the Agency to provide employees disparately impacted by the five-tier system with a blanket twelve-year RIF retention service credit "regardless of their summary rating." The Agency asserts that the disputed portion of the provision is, therefore, in direct violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.504(a), which states, in pertinent part, that "[o]nly ratings of record...shall be used as the basis for granting additional retention service credit in a [RIF]." By failing to respond to the Agency's argument that the disputed portion of Provision 8 violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.504(a), the Union concedes that it does. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 1226,</span> 62 FLRA at 460. Accordingly, we find that the disputed portion of Provision 8 violates 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.504(a) and, as such, is outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Some flexibility was shown in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 744, 746 (1992), requiring bargaining on Provision 22, that "the supervisor" will prepare the appraisal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As Provision 22 identifies the person who prepares the performance evaluation as the "supervisor," we view the provision as requiring only that someone within an employee's supervisory chain prepare the employee's appraisal. In this connection, we note that the regulation governing performance management, 5 C.F.R. Part 430, uses the term "supervisor," among others, to identify the management official responsible for appraising performance, without assigning that function to a specific individual. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 430.204(c) and 4320.206(c). Accordingly, we find that Provision 22 does not dictate the particular individual who is responsible for preparing a performance appraisal. Rather, management retains discretion to choose who will evaluate an employee's performance....</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable was a proposal that the agency "[a]dd a place for the activity head designee" endorsement on an appraisal form. <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local No. 1 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 38 FLRA 1589, 1601-04 (1991) (Proposal 3). As a procedure consistent with a governing agency regulation, the proposal was not nonnegotiable because its implementation required some action on the part of agency personnel. The proposal took effect "after the Agency [had] exercised its right to assign work by designating the official who has the responsibility to approve performance appraisals." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220 and SSA</span>, 65 FLRA 726 (2011) (noting negotiability as procedure of contract provision, interpreted by an arbitrator, that limited number of management officials participating in initial "performance expectation" discussions with employees; <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 220,</span> 65 FLRA 638 (2011)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Also negotiable were proposals designed to ensure quality reviews in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 823, 825-28 (1991), involving two portions of Proposal 17: subsection (2), whenever possible, each case will be reviewed by a reviewer having technical competence in the art area being reviewed; subsection (3), whenever possible, each case will be reviewed by a reviewer who is familiar with the specific examining procedures used in the art area being reviewed. Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">POPA</span> was the first section of Proposal 17, that each case be reviewed by at least two independent reviewers. FLRA said of those proposals and a related provision, subsection 4 (and another linked provision, Proposal 18), mandating that information be disclosed concerning the qualifications of reviewers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection 1 of Proposal 17 is outside the duty to bargain.&#x2003;The requirement of this subsection that at least two reviewers will evaluate examiners' work duplicates a requirement of Proposal 9, above. As stated with respect to Proposal 9, this requirement directly interferes with management's right to determine the number of employees assigned to a work project under section 7106 (b)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsections 2 and 3 of Proposal 17 require that "whenever possible," each case will be reviewed by a reviewer who has technical competence in the art area being reviewed and who is familiar with the specific examining procedures used in that art area. These provisions specifically concern management's selection of the reviewers who will evaluate an examiner's work. The effect of subsections 2 and 3 of Proposal 17 is to establish qualification standards to be applied in the assignment of reviewers. So intended, these provisions directly interfere with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, however, that subsections 2 and 3 constitute negotiable appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. The Union contends that the assignment of an inexperienced reviewer can adversely affect the accuracy of a review, and that the accuracy and fairness of reviews are enhanced when the reviewer is familiar with the subject matter of the case under review. Accordingly, we find that subsections 2 and 3 were intended to ameliorate the adverse effects on examiners' eligibility for promotion caused by inexperienced reviewers and that they constitute arrangements....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further we find that, on balance, the significant benefit to employees associated with fair and accurate reviews outweighs the burden placed on management by these provisions.... In that regard, the proposal does not dictate that management assign any particular individuals as reviewers or limit the organizational segment from which reviewers can be drawn. Further, while it sets a standard for the assignment of reviewers, the standard is general and nonquantitative, thus preserving a great deal of management discretion in these assignments. Finally, the qualifying phrase "whenever possible" allows for instances where there may be no available reviewer with extensive familiarity with the relevant subject matter. Accordingly, we find subsections 2 and 3 to be negotiable appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection 4 of the proposal is negotiable.&#x2003;This subsection states that the technical and legal qualifications of each reviewer will be disclosed in accordance with the requirements of "[Proposal] 18." Proposal 18 requires disclosure of the "technical background" and "technical training" of reviewers who allege error in the event an examiner is denied a permanent grant of signatory authority. Reading the proposals together, we understand the Union to be asking for release of objective data concerning a reviewer's background, such as education, work experience, training, and professional certifications, if applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we reject the Agency's argument that the matters relating to the qualifications of nonunit employees do not concern conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14) of the statute. The Authority will find matters that vitally affect the conditions of employment of bargaining unit members to be negotiable, regardless of their effect on nonunit members.... Contrary to the agency's contention, the technical ability and experience of persons who evaluate examiners' patent actions in the Program has a direct effect on the manner in which examiners' work is reviewed and judged. In turn, those evaluations determine examiners' success or failure at Program stages and ultimately their ability to qualify for promotion. Thus understood, the disclosures required by subsection 4 do concern matters that affect examiners' vital interests so as to be matters relating to their conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, subsection 4 of Proposal 17 requires only the disclosure of objective data regarding the reviewers, and not information concerning the Agency's ultimate conclusions and judgments as to the competence of its supervisors. The release of such objective data does not interfere with any deliberations the Agency may have concerning the case review or the assignment of reviewers. Moreover, the Agency has not shown how disclosure of this information conflicts with any law or regulation, and no such conflict is apparent to us....</p>
