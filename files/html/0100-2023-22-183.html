<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-181"><span class="space">13.</span> Direct Recovery of Costs by Appellants</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Civil Service Reform Act permits recovery of reasonable attorney fees incurred by a prevailing appellant. 5 USC 7701(g)(1). The Act does not permit recovery of "costs" apart from a component of counsel fees. Under Board practice, a fee petition may include the reasonable, allowable costs incurred by counsel related to his representation of the appellant, but if the appellant incurs his own costs, e.g., photocopying or postage, those costs are not independently recoverable under the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 39 MSPR 622, 626 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Suggs v. VA,</span> SF-0752-09-0734-C-2 (NP 2/11/2015) ("We also note that the Board's regulations do not provide for out-of-pocket costs in a petition for enforcement."); <span class="Italic">Beeler-Smith v. OPM,</span> DC-844E-09-0520-A-1 (NP 8/20/2010) ("the administrative judge properly disallowed the appellant's personal travel expenses to her attorney's office and the videotape of her medical condition as not within the scope of allowable costs. <span class="Italic">See Bennett v. Department of the Navy,</span> 699 F.2d 1140, 1145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1983).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule differs for civil rights cases. 5 USC 7701(g)(2) provides that the standards of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended, govern counsel fee recoveries in decisions based on findings of discrimination. The Civil Rights Act, 42 USC 2000e-5(k), provides for "a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs." This phrase is interpreted to provide a separate entitlement to the appellant (divorced from counsel) for costs incurred by the appellant in pursuit of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 55 MSPR 84, 86 (1992) (reimbursing out-of-pocket expenses of appellant for postage, fax, copying, and mailing), <span class="Italic">cited</span> <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">approval</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 175, 179 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Act contains a provision, codified at 5 USC 1221(g)(2), that employees or applicants prevailing before the Board in decisions based on a prohibited personnel practice are entitled to "reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred." In a result later overruled, the Board first interpreted the WPA phrase to provide an entitlement to costs no greater than what was allowed to appellants under the CSRA, i.e., appellants could not recover costs incurred by themselves rather than by their counsel. <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 451-52 (1991). The Board relented in <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 175, 178-80 (1993), overruling <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> and deciding that successful WPA appellants could recover their own costs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that an employee who prevails on a Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) claim based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice cannot recover for out-of-pocket expenses he directly incurred. In making that finding, he correctly stated the Board's holding on the issue in <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441, 451-52 (1991). We have reopened this appeal in order to reconsider that holding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The applicable statute here provides that, where an appellant prevails on a WPA claim based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice, the agency is liable to the appellant for "reasonable attorney fees and any other reasonable costs incurred" in pursuing the WPA complaint before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1221(g)(1). The use of the conjunction "and" between fees and costs in the quoted language plainly indicates two separate entitlements for the prevailing appellant....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, the Board recognized that the legislative history of 5 USC 1221(g) does not explain whether the phrase "any other reasonable costs incurred" allows a prevailing appellant to recover costs other than those incurred on his behalf by counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, 50 MSPR at 451-52.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, the Board concluded that a Joint Explanatory Statement published in the Congressional Record regarding 5 USC 1221(g)(1) was dispositive....&#8197;The Board noted that, in that Statement, Congress referred to the substantial case law developed by the Board and the courts on what constitutes "reasonable attorney fees." The Board then reviewed its applicable precedent on reasonable attorney fees, which held that an appellant is not entitled to reimbursement for expenses directly incurred by him in connection with the pursuit of a Board appeal; only an appellant's counsel can recover for out-of-pocket costs incurred by him on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, 50 MSPR at 452, citing <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Department of Health and Human Services v. Balaban</span>, 39 <span id="Page_4717"></span>MSPR 622, 625-26 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140, 1145 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Board applied this construction of what constitutes "reasonable attorney fees" to 5 USC 1221(g) and found that out-of-pocket costs incurred by a prevailing appellant were not reimbursable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reexamination, we find this construction flawed. The fact that the Board and the courts have defined "reasonable attorney fees" to include some out-of-pocket expenses incurred by counsel on an appellant's behalf suggests that the phrase "and any other reasonable costs" in 5 USC 1221(g) should have a different meaning than that given it by <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>. If Congress had intended the meaning assigned by <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> to the phrase about costs, the phrase would be superfluous, because the phrase about fees has already been construed by the Board and the courts to include costs incurred by an attorney. The construction in <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> of 5 USC 1221(g) thus is contrary to an elementary rule of statutory construction and cannot be sustained....&#8197;As noted above, to give effect to the phrase "and any other reasonable costs," it must constitute a separate entitlement for a prevailing appellant. Therefore, since the phrase itself does not suggest any limited or restrictive meaning, we find that it includes costs directly incurred by an appellant who prevails on a WPA claim. The holding in <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> on this issue thus is overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The out-of-pocket costs claimed by the appellant total $492.47 and include the following: $68.22 in copying costs and clerical services; $283.25 in word processing services; $34.00 in facsimile costs; and $107.00 in postage. The appellant certified below that these costs were incurred during the pursuit of his Board appeal and that the amount of the costs was reasonable; he also submitted supporting documentation. The agency has not alleged either below or on petition for review that the amount claimed was unreasonable. Therefore, we find that the costs claimed by the appellant are reasonable and should be awarded to him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Roman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 72 MSPR 409, 411-12, 416-20 (1996), confirmed the ability of an appellant to recover costs when there is a finding whistleblower reprisal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its final decision in the underlying IRA appeal, the Board granted, in part, the appellant's request for corrective action, finding that the agency's November 18, 1990 decision not to promote him to the GM-14 position of Chief, High Altitude Defense Projects Branch, White Sands Missile Range, constituted reprisal for whistleblowing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant had established his entitlement to the following costs: $307.27 for photocopy, facsimile, and Freedom of Information Act copy costs; $64.78 for certified mail expenses and Federal Express delivery charges; $18.90 for a book containing the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; $855.82 for deposition-related expenditures; $23.66 for office supplies; and $45.97 for long-distance telephone calls. The administrative judge also awarded the appellant $87.50 for travel expenses as consequential damages. The administrative judge denied the remainder of the appellant's request for costs and consequential damages, including the following claimed damages: (1) $6,064.00 for real estate management fees; (2) medical expenses, pain, and suffering allegedly resulting from the agency's reprisal; and (3) lost promotional opportunities....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied the appellant's claim for reasonable reimbursement for the time that he spent litigating the underlying IRA appeal because "compensating the appellant (at any amount) for the time he spent prosecuting his appeal would be tantamount to awarding attorney fees to a non-attorney." The administrative judge also denied the appellant's request for $4,218.53 in attorney fees for time expended by an attorney on the issue of consequential damages, because he (the administrative judge) had denied "all the requested consequential damages (except for nominal travel expenses)." Further, the administrative judge found that "from the appellant's submissions, it is clear that the retained counsel did not help him with the costs portion of his motion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claimed $556.75 in travel costs, contending that he incurred these expenses when he made 163 round trips from various locations to libraries at the New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) to conduct research for his IRA appeal. The appellant did not give specific dates for any of the trips, but instead asserted that he made ninety-one trips to the NMSU library from June 1993 through July 1994, fifty-nine trips to that library from August 1994 through April 1995, and seven trips to that location from May through August 1995. The appellant also claimed to have made six trips to the UTEP library, but he provided no time periods for any of those visits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that the appellant failed to document any of the trips, and that the research was unnecessary because he did legal research for his appeal during working hours in the agency's technical and law libraries. The agency asserted that the appellant neither contended nor showed that the NMSU and UTEP libraries contained any pertinent materials that could not have been obtained at the agency's library facilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that travel expenses are potentially recoverable as consequential damages under 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).[1] Noting that the appellant's claim of 163 library visits was an estimate unaccompanied by an explanation, the administrative judge found that the number of visits was excessive, even though the underlying appeal was "factually complex." However, recognizing the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status and the need for a reasonable amount of research, the administrative judge awarded travel expenses for twenty library trips to conduct research relating to the underlying appeal and five library trips to perform research relating to the motion for costs and damages. Using the appellant's claimed rate of twenty-five cents per mile and calculating an average round trip distance of fourteen miles based on the appellant's estimates, the administrative judge determined that the appellant was entitled to $87.50 for the twenty-five trips. The appellant contends on petition for review that the administrative judge should have granted him the entire amount of his claimed travel expenses. At the threshold, we must determine what statutory provision applies to these travel costs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;This provision provides that corrective action in an IRA appeal may include "travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant's mileage expenses are costs within the meaning of former 5 USC 1221(g)(1) rather than travel expenses. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to decide the meaning of "travel expenses" in 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under section 3(a) of the 1989 WPA, formerly codified at 5 USC 1221(g)(1), an agency is liable for "reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred" when an appellant is the prevailing party before the Board and the decision is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice. In <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 441 (1991), the Board determined that, under section 1221(g)(1), an appellant who is a prevailing party is not entitled to reimbursement for directly incurred out-of-pocket expenses. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 451-53. In <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Department of the Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 175 (1993), the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> and found that the 1989 Act allows for payment of reasonable out-of-pocket costs directly incurred by an appellant who prevails on a WPA claim. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 178-79.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to redesignating the attorney fees provision of 5 USC 1221(g)(1) as 5 USC 1221(g)(2), section 8 of the 1994 Act added 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), which, as discussed above, provided for the recovery of consequential damages. The administrative judge awarded $87.50 in travel expenses to the appellant as consequential damages under section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), rather than as costs under section 1221(g)(2). If the administrative judge applied the correct statutory provision, the appellant would not be entitled to any travel expenses in light of our finding, as set forth above, that the consequential damages provisions of section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) do not apply retroactively. However, for the following reasons, we find that 5 USC 1221(g)(2) is the statutory provision that applies to the travel costs claimed by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Senate bill 622 (S. 622, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994)) contained a proposed amendment to section 1221(g)(2) that would have replaced the phrase "and any other reasonable costs incurred" with the phrase "and any other reasonable costs incurred directly or indirectly by the employee, former employee, or applicant." S. Rep. No. 358, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1994). The legislative history of S. 622 shows that the suggested change was intended to "overrule[&#8197;] the [Board's] ruling in the case of <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Department of the Air Force</span> that whistleblowers are entitled to recover reasonable costs incurred by their attorneys, but not costs they incur themselves." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 8. In proposing the change, Congress "recognize[d] that, in October of 1993, the [Board] itself...over-ruled this holding of <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span> in <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Department of the Navy</span>." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Congress did not adopt the amendment to section 1221(g)(2) proposed in S. 622, and the legislative history does not indicate the reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that the decision not to adopt the Senate's proposed amendment to section 1221(g)(2) could mean either that (1) Congress concluded that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Bonggat</span> was incorrect and should not be codified into the statute; or (2) Congress approved of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Bonggat</span> and concluded that its codification was unnecessary. We find the latter alternative to comport most closely with the rules of statutory construction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress enacted the 1994 Act, it was presumed to have known of <span class="Italic">Bonggat's</span> expansive construction of the term "other reasonable costs." <span class="Italic">See Benedetto v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 32 MSPR 530, 534 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 847 F.2d 814 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Indeed, as discussed above, the legislative history shows that Congress had actual knowledge of that construction. Yet, neither the amended statute nor the legislative history shows that Congress wished to mandate a more restrictive interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 1221(g)(2); H.R. Rep. No. 769, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994); S. Rep. No. 358, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994) U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1994, p. 3549. Thus, we will continue to follow <span class="Italic">Bonggat's</span> interpretation of the term "other reasonable costs."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4718"></span>The legislative history of the 1989 WPA indicates that the term "reasonable costs" is meant to include "costs directly related to the litigation, such as photocopying, long-distance telephone calls, and production of evidence, but is not meant to include extraneous costs resulting from the prohibited personnel practice but not directly related to the litigation such as job counseling and retraining." 135 Cong. Rec. S2784 (daily ed. Mar. 16, 1989) (Joint Explanatory Statement); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at H749 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989) (Joint Explanatory Statement). Consistent with this legislative intent, the Board in <span class="Italic">Bonggat</span> found that out-of-pocket costs reimbursable to a prevailing <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant include copying costs and clerical services, word processing services, facsimile costs, and postage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 MSPR at 179. Moreover, courts and administrative agencies have found that other fee-shifting statutes allow reimbursement, as "costs," of transportation expenses incurred by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant in the course of litigating his or her own claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, applying the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and following the holding of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Oliveira v. United States</span>, 827 F.2d 735, 744 (Fed. Cir. 1987), that reimbursable expenses are not limited to items specifically enumerated in the EAJA, the Court of Veterans Appeals found that transportation expenses incurred by a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant to conduct legal research for his appeal were recoverable as costs. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">March v. Brown</span>, 7 Vet.App. 163, 169-70 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 74 F.3d 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Therefore, in addition to awarding the appellant his expenses for photocopying and postage, the court found that he was also entitled to the cost of his bus fare to a law library. <span class="Italic">See March</span>, 7 Vet. App. at 169-70.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has found that "costs" under 28 USC 1920 and its regulations include not only expenses such as transcription, printing, and copying expenses, but also mileage and travel expenses incurred by a petitioner in the course of litigating his or her equal employment opportunity complaint, as long as the mileage and travel expenses are reasonable<span class="Italic">. See Clay v. Department of the Army</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04950006 (Dec. 14, 1995); <span class="Italic">Fiene v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Petition No. 04920009 (Sept. 3, 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's reasonable transportation expenses related to his trips to the NMSU and UTEP libraries to conduct legal research for his appeal are reimbursable as costs. Because costs are recoverable under the 1989 WPA, <span class="Italic">see Bonggat</span>, 59 MSPR at 178-79, there is no retroactivity issue involved with respect to the appellant's mileage claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge provided concise and specific reasons for awarding the appellant twenty-five library trips for research, and we find no basis for substituting our judgment for that of the administrative judge on this matter. <span class="Italic">See Downes v. Department of Transp.</span>, 36 MSPR 207, 210-11, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 865 F.2d 269 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table). Moreover, the agency's pleadings placed the appellant on notice that his record of the trips was devoid of any information as to the specific dates and mileage of the trips, yet he failed to furnish the administrative judge with more detailed information. Nor does the appellant's vague contention on petition for review that he provided a "conservative" estimate of the number of library visits raise a serious question as to the findings of the administrative judge that would warrant our review of the record. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 211. Hence, we find that the appellant is entitled to $87.50 in mileage, recoverable as "costs" under 5 USC 1221(g)(2).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency has not argued that the appellant's claimed rate of twenty-five cents per mile is unreasonable. The authorized rate for official travel on behalf of the Government in a privately-owned conveyance at the time of the appellant's 1993 and 1994 trips was twenty-five cents per mile, and it was thirty cents per mile at the time of his 1995 trips. <span class="Italic">See</span> 59 Fed. Reg. 66,626 (1994). Under these circumstances, we find no basis to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was entitled to his claimed rate of twenty-five cents per mile for all of the allowed trips. <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Grimm v. Lane</span>, 895 F. Supp. 907, 917 (S.D. Ohio 1995) (awarding travel mileage at the rate of twenty-eight cents per mile).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may be deemed a "prevailing party" for purposes of an attorney fees award if all or a significant portion of the relief sought in his petition was obtained as a result of the filing of the petition. <span class="Italic">See Stein v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 537, 540, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 41 F.3d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). The appellant stated that he retained an attorney, Michael W. Lilley, to assist him with his claim for consequential damages. Moreover, the appellant does not allege error in the administrative judge's finding that Mr. Lilley provided assistance to him solely with respect to his claim for consequential damages, and "did not help him with the costs portion of his motion."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim for consequential damages is distinct from his claim for costs because, as explained above, the claims are based on different statutory provisions. Given that Mr. Lilley assisted the appellant only with his claim for consequential damages, and in view of the fact that the appellant has not prevailed on any part of that claim, we find that the appellant is not entitled to the attorney fees he seeks, assuming that he would otherwise be entitled to such fees and that such fees were reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 304 (1996) ("If a party 'fail[s] to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee.'" (citations omitted)). In addition, we concur in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant may not recover attorney fees for the work he himself performed in litigating this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 45 MSPR 693, 697 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA and VEOA counsel fee provisions, noted in the preceding section, appear to permit recovery by the prevailing appellant of either or both counsel fees and litigation expenses, suggesting that these amounts may be awarded directly to the appellant.
