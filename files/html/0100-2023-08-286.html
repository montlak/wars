<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-281"><span class="space">a.</span> Nonfrivolous Jurisdictional Allegations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">All the discussion of liberal or relaxed pleading standards for a USERRA case notwithstanding, the Board expressed a nonfrivolous pleading standard in the analysis of a USERRA discrimination or reprisal claim, <span class="Italic">Brasch v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, CH-4324-15-0390-I-1 (NP 2/29/2016) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Brasch v. MSPB</span>, 664 Fed. Appx. 915 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's claims in this appeal are of the second type; namely, that the agency denied him certain benefits of employment due to his military service and retaliated against him for exercising his rights under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the relevant portions of the law:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter, (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), an appellant must allege that: (1) he performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 5 (2003), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Goldberg v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 8 n.1 (2005). The USERRA standard for the appellant's retaliation claims is set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), which provides in relevant part that an employer "may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person" because he "(1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter...or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter." <span class="Italic">Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). In either instance, it is key for the appellant to nonfrivolously allege some connection between the agency's actions and his protected military status. Once an appellant has established Board jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, via the requisite nonfrivolous allegations,[2] he has an unconditional right to a hearing on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">Downs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2008), <span class="Italic">cited with approval in Baney v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 415 F. App'x 244, 246 (Fed. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). To meet the nonfrivolous <span id="Page_470"></span>standard, an appellant need only plead allegations of fact which, if proven, could show jurisdiction, though mere <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to satisfy the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">Walker v.

<p class="Body-Text">Affirming, the Federal Circuit subscribed to the necessity of nonfrivolous allegations to support Board USERRA jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Brasch v. MSPB</span>, 664 Fed. Appx. 915, 917-19 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that the Board has jurisdiction over an alleged USERRA violation under &#x00A7; 4311(a), a petitioner must make non-frivolous allegations that (1) he or she was a member of the uniformed services, (2) the agency denied initial or continued employment or a benefit of employment, and (3) military service was a "substantial or motivating factor" in the denial. <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). To establish that the Board has jurisdiction over the reprisal-type USERRA violation under &#x00A7; 4311(b), a petition must make non-frivolous allegations that (1) the petitioner took action to enforce a protection afforded to any person under Chapter 43 of Title 38 of the U.S. Code, and (2) the petitioner's action was a "substantial or motivating factor" in the agency discrimination or retaliation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under either cause of action, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal only if the petitioner alleges facts that, if proven, would establish a violation of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Conclusory, vague, or unsupported allegations are not sufficient to meet this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Brasch has failed to establish that the Board has jurisdiction over his &#x00A7; 4311(a) appeals. Mr. Brasch's allegations under &#x00A7; 4311(a) are all of a similar type--he alleges that the Agency denied him certain benefits provided to non-military Agency personnel because of his military service. Mr. Brasch submitted sufficient documentation of his military service for the AJ to find that Mr. Brasch had been a member of the uniformed services and thus that the requirements of the first prong of &#x00A7; 4311(a) were fulfilled. But prongs two and three of &#x00A7; 4311(a) require Mr. Brasch to also show that the Agency denied him a benefit of employment, and that prior military service was a "substantial or motivating factor" in the Agency's denial. While it is not clear whether the Board determined in its decision that the benefits Mr. Brasch claimed <span class="Italic">were</span>, in fact, benefits of employment, it is clear that Mr. Brasch has not provided any factual basis to link the Agency's denial of the alleged benefits to his prior military service. The essence of a meritorious &#x00A7; 4311(a) USERRA claim is that a covered individual was denied a benefit <span class="Italic">because</span> he or she served in the military.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board's determination that Mr. Brasch has "failed to allege facts, which, if proven, could establish that his military status or his USERRA activity was at least a motivating factor in the cited agency actions." Because Mr. Brasch failed to make non-frivolous allegations that the Agency denied him benefits based on his prior military service, we affirm the Board's decisions dismissing his &#x00A7; 4311(a) claims for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find Mr. Brasch has failed to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his reprisal-type &#x00A7; 4311(b) claims. Mr. Brasch alleges that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 4311(b) by retaliating against him for raising multiple USERRA claims to the Board. As with his &#x00A7; 4311(a) claims, Mr. Brasch's &#x00A7; 4311(b) claims are wholly conclusory. We agree that Mr. Brasch has failed to allege facts which, if proven, may establish that his USERRA activity was at least a motivating factor in the Agency's actions. Because Mr. Brasch has not alleged an adequate causal link between the alleged Agency reprisal and Mr. Brasch's multiple USERRA claims, we find that the Board properly affirmed the AJ's Initial Decisions dismissing these &#x00A7; 4311(b) appeals for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to <span class="Italic">Brasch</span>, the Board cited <span class="Italic">Downs v. VA</span>, 110 MSPR 139, 144-45 &#x00B6; 10, 2008 MSPB 230 (2008), involving VEOA and USERRA claims. As to the USERRA claim, <span class="Italic">Downs</span> determined that the appellant has an unconditional right to a hearing if there is jurisdiction and stated that "[a] claim under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 146 &#x00B6; 15, <span class="Italic">citing Tindall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 230, 233 &#x00B6; 6 (1999), in turn reciting that "In <span class="Italic">Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 86, 92 (1997), the Board suggested that a claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous. <span class="Italic">See also Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484-85 (Fed.

Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 145 F.3d 1480, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Recently emphasizing a liberal USERRA pleading standard, the Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Durr v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-2131.OPINION.2-2-2021_1726853.pdf">844 Fed. Appx. 329</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA, codified at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4301-4335, affords various protections to current and former military service members with respect to their employment, and prohibits employers from discriminating against their employees because of their military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed, to establish the MSPB's jurisdiction over an appeal alleging a violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), Mr. Durr was required to make nonfrivolous allegations that: "(1) [he] performed, applied to perform, or [was] obligated to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) [he] lost a benefit of employment or any of the rights protected by USERRA; and (3) the performance, application to perform, or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in the loss of the right or benefit." <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, 145 F.3d at 1484. We have previously held that the MSPB should take a "liberal approach in determining whether jurisdiction exists under USERRA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. So long as they are nonfrivolous, the relative weakness of the appellant's initial factual allegations related to jurisdiction should not serve as a basis to dismiss a USERRA claim, and should instead serve as a basis to deny the claim on the merits if the appellant fails to sufficiently develop the allegations. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1160 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the administrative judge erred in failing to credit Mr. Durr's allegations which plainly allege discrimination because of his <span class="Italic">status</span> as a veteran, rather than because of his service-connected disability. Most notably, Mr. Durr alleged that USPS's "deliberate and intentional disregard for the Plaintiff['s] psychologist['s] request [that Mr. Durr be put on medical leave]...[was] for reason of the Plaintiff['s] status of being a 10-point, military service-connected disabled veteran[,]" and that "if another employee had made a request for leave for medical reasons, that such would have been granted." We agree with Mr. Durr and the MSPB that these allegations are nonfrivolous and plainly satisfy the third element of the USERRA jurisdictional test. Accordingly, we conclude that the MSPB has jurisdiction over Mr. Durr's instant appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stoglin v. DHS</span>, CH-3330-17-0105-I-1 (NP 2/1/2023), described an allegation that did not meet the nonfrivolous pleading standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim of discrimination is based solely on the fact that his relevant experience for the position in question was derived from his time in the military, and he assumes that the hiring official would have been aware that this was the case. Notwithstanding, the appellant's bare assertion that the hiring official did not select him for the position due to his military service does not rise to the level of a nonfrivolous allegation. Under the circumstances, we agree with the administrative judge's ultimate disposition dismissing the appellant's USERRA appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) for lack of jurisdiction. Absent a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) of the USERRA statute, the appellant was not entitled to a hearing in connection with that provision. <span class="Italic">Downs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But Pinsonneault v. Dept. of Army</span>, NY-315H-17-0203-I-1 <span class="Italic">(NP 5/19/2022), remanded a claim dismissed by the AJ for lack of adequate allegations, and in the process the Board discounted technical application of a nonfrivolous pleading standard:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's analysis, the appellant's requirement to prove that her military obligation was a "substantial or motivating factor" in the agency's action does not arise at the jurisdictional stage and is not analyzed under the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">See Lazard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 9 (2003) (distinguishing between the sufficiency of allegations at the jurisdictional stage and the merits stage of a USERRA appeal). Likewise, the administrative judge incorrectly held that, to prove her military obligation was a motivating factor in her termination, the appellant must nonfrivolously allege the agency relied on, took into account, considered, or conditioned its decision on her military obligation. This finding incorrectly conflates the appellant's burden at the jurisdictional and merits determination stages. The <span class="Italic">Erickson</span> decision, on which the administrative judge relied, applies that standard to a merits determination, not to a jurisdictional finding. <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, 571 F.3d at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that a claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is nonfrivolous for jurisdictional purposes, particularly when, as here, the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se. Wilson</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 9. The weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss a USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop her contentions, her USERRA claim <span id="Page_471"></span>should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An appellant's allegation in general terms that the agency denied her retention in employment due to her uniformed service is sufficient to establish USERRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Searcy v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 8 (2010) (finding vague and unspecific allegations that the agency denied employment in a position because of prior uniformed service was sufficient to establish USERRA jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. Department of Commerce</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 9 (2010) (finding that the appellant established USERRA jurisdiction when he asserted that he performed duty in a uniformed service of the United States, the agency was aware of his prior uniformed service, and it denied him employment in a temporary position in part because of his prior uniformed service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant did not submit any concrete evidence to substantiate her claims that the agency terminated her during her probationary period because of her prior duty and obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service. However, the appellant has alleged that she was terminated within 1 month of notifying the agency of her mobilization, and that her termination violated her rights as a member of the uniformed services. She also has alleged that the agency's proffered reasons for termination were disprovable, and suggested that other employees engaging in similar conduct are not terminated. This, coupled with the fact that her termination was less than 2 months after she received a time off award, is sufficient to establish a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was due to her obligation to perform duty in the uniformed services of the United States. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (explaining that discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from factors such as the proximity in time between the military activity and the adverse action, inconsistencies between the agency's proffered reasons and other actions of the employer, and disparate treatment of the appellant compared to similarly situated employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA claim, we find that the appellant is entitled to a remand for further development of the record and adjudication on the merits of her USERRA claim. The appellant elected not to request a hearing in her appeal when she originally filed. In light of this remand, the administrative judge should provide the appellant with another opportunity to request a hearing if she so chooses. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 168, &#x00B6; 6 (finding an appellant who raises a USERRA claim has an unconditional right to a hearing).</p>
