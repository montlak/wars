<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-392"><span class="space">e.</span> Individual Who Signs Remedial Notice</h5>
<p class="noindent">The respondent does not designate the individual who signs a notice ordered by FLRA. Identification of the individual who will sign the notice is within FLRA's discretion. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, AFLC, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 217, 220 (1990) (noting that frequently commanding officer of military installation will be required to sign notice); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD, Kentucky State Office and AFGE Local 3980</span>, 58 FLRA 73, 73 (2002) (FLRA generally "directs the posting of a notice signed by the highest official of the activity responsible for the violation"); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA, Standiford ATCT and NATCA Local SDF</span>, 53 FLRA 312, 322 (1997) (noting FLRA's typical practice that notice be signed by highest official of activity responsible for violation); <span class="Italic">AAFES, McClellan Base Exch. and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 764, 770 (1990). The ULP remedial order should not direct a "responsible official" to sign the posting because that procedure allows the respondent to decide who signs the notice; instead, FLRA is to designate who will sign the notice. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 35 FLRA 1230, 1231 (1990). FLRA does not distinguish magnitudes of ULPs in determining who should sign postings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Naval Air Station Alameda and IAM Lodge 739</span>, 36 FLRA 705, 707 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a ULP involved a subordinate component of an agency, FLRA may require that the remedial notice be signed by the commanding officer of the parent organization rather than by the management official in charge of the subordinate organizational element. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 32 FLRA 277, 280 (1988). If a subordinate organization, e.g., a regional office, committed the ULP, it may be appropriate for the regional director to sign the notice. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 38 FLRA 989, 993 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, Reg'l Personnel Office, Seattle and Saul</span>, 48 FLRA 410, 411 (1993); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Space Sys. Div. and AFGE Local 2429</span>, 38 FLRA 1485, 1488 (1991) ("[W]e find no contention in the record by the General Counsel or the Union that the Commander of the AFSC should be required to sign the remedial Notice. In this regard, the General Counsel requested that the Respondent be ordered to '[p]ost an appropriate notice to be signed by the Commanding Officers.'").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Council 215,</span> 64 FLRA 293, 297-98 (2009), determined that the highest official implicated in a refusal to bargain ULP may be required to sign a posting:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the parties dispute which Respondent official should sign the notice posting. The Authority typically directs the posting of a notice signed by the highest official of the activity responsible for the violation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, </span>56 FLRA 696, 699 (2000). In this regard, the Authority has explained that directing the highest official to sign the notice "signif[ies] that the Respondent acknowledges its obligations under the Statute and intends to comply with those obligations."<span class="Italic"> Id. (citing U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Wash., D.C., </span>48 FLRA 1400, 1402 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing precedent, the GC asks that the notice be signed by the Commissioner, who is the head of the Respondent, because the violation occurred through the actions of an Associate Commissioner at the Respondent's headquarters. The Respondent does not dispute that this Associate Commissioner denied the information request, but asks that the notice be signed by someone who was "involved in the negotiations[,]" such as the Chief Spokesperson for negotiations or the Associate Commissioner for the Office of Labor-Management and Employee Relations. As there is no dispute that the Commissioner is the highest official of the Respondent, the Commissioner ordinarily would be the appropriate official to sign the notice posting, consistent with the foregoing precedent. Accordingly, consistent with established Authority precedent, we will direct that the Commissioner sign the notice.</p>
<p class="noindent">The highest official of an employee and labor relations office may be directed to sign a posting when nothing implicates agency officials outside of that office in a charge of interference with arbitration proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 61 FLRA 825, 826 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the ULP is committed by an official distinct from the activity, as, for example, when an inspector general interferes with representational rights of an employee during an investigatory interview, the official who caused the problem will sign the remedial notice, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Office of Inspector Gen. and AFGE INS Council, Local 1210</span>, 47 FLRA 1254, 1264 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also agree with the Judge that the designated official who should sign the notice is the Respondent's Inspector General. The Authority has repeatedly held that requiring a responsible official to sign the notice signifies that a respondent acknowledges its obligations under the Statute and intends to comply with those obligations....&#8197;As the unlawful refusal to permit union representation was committed by OIG agents, and as this conduct affects the entire nationwide consolidated unit, ordering the Inspector General to sign the notice comports with the above requirements....</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 55 FLRA 1250, 1256-60 (2000), considered whether law in the negotiability area, precluding a union from designating a particular official to perform a particular task, precluded FLRA from directing a given official to sign a posting. FLRA determined that no statutory impediment foreclosed it from directing the level of official who will sign a remedial notice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;Directing the Bureau Head to Sign the Posting Is an Appropriate Exercise of the Authority's Remedial Powers</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on precedent developed in negotiability cases, the Respondents contend that the Judge's recommended order, which directs a specific agency official to sign the posting, is invalid because the order interferes with the Bureau's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). For the reasons that follow, we find that the order is a legitimate exercise of the Authority's remedial powers.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. The Management Rights Provisions of the Statute Do Not Diminish the Authority's Remedial Powers</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the powers and duties of the Authority under section 7105 of the Statute is to "require an agency or a labor organization to cease and desist from violations of [the Statute] and require it to take <span class="Italic">any</span> <span class="Italic">remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out the</span> <span class="Italic">policies of [the Statute]</span><span class="Italic">." </span>(emphasis added). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(g)(3). Similarly, section 7118(a)(7) also provides that the Authority may order any combination of certain enumerated remedies <span class="Italic">"or such other action as will carry</span> <span class="Italic">out the purpose of this chapter." </span>(emphasis added). The issue of the relationship of these powers and section 7106(a) has not been previously presented to the Authority. However, after examining the purpose, as evidenced by the wording and structure of section 7106, its legislative history, and the manner in which the section has been applied and interpreted to date, we conclude that Congress intended section 7106 to limit the scope of collective bargaining rather than the Authority's remedial power. In our view, interpreting section 7106(a) as a limitation on the Authority's unfair labor practice remedial power would significantly frustrate the Authority's obligation to repair and restore the effects of statutory violations. The Statute provides the Authority the discretion to fashion remedies as long as such remedies are consistent with the purposes and policies of the Statute. The Authority has consistently exercised this legislative grant of remedial discretion in the manner that Congress intended.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The Purpose of Section 7106(a) Is to Limit the Scope of Bargaining</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the introductory command in section 7106(a) that "nothing in this chapter [i.e. the Statute]" shall affect the exercise of the enumerated management rights, in our view section 7106(a) is applicable only to the scope of bargaining. The language and structure, legislative history, and manner in which section 7106 has been interpreted support our determination that the purpose of section 7106(a) is to limit the scope of bargaining. Turning first to the statutory language and structure, the subsection's introductory phrase makes it "subject to subsection (b) of this section." Section 7106(b), on the other hand, refers specifically and exclusively to "negotiation." This language, structure, and context provide support for the conclusion that the general terms of subsection (a) are intended to refer to the scope of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See Bailey v. United States,</span> 516 U.S. 137, 145 (1995) ("[T]he meaning of statutory language, plain <span id="page_1666"></span>or not, depends on context.") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Moreover, this interpretation is also consistent with the views of reviewing courts. <span class="Italic">See NFFE and FLRA v. Department of the Interior</span>, _U.S._, 119 S. Ct. 1003, 1010 (1999) (Section 7106(a) "withdraws from collective bargaining certain subjects that it reserves exclusively for decision by management" and section 7106(b) "preserv[es] the duty to bargain with respect to certain matters otherwise committed to the discretion of management."); <span class="Italic">see also Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana Air Chapter, No. 29 v. FLRA, </span>22 F.3d 1150, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (Section 7106(b) constitutes an exception to the "nonnegotiability of management rights enumerated in subsection (a)[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That section 7106 was intended as a limit on the scope of bargaining is confirmed by the Statute's legislative history. Section 7106 had its origin in the bill introduced in the House of Representatives.<span class="Italic"> See </span>H.R. 11280, 95th Cong. &#x00A7; 7106 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform</span> <span class="Italic">Act of 1978, </span>96th Cong., 1st Sess. (Comm. Print No. <span class="Italic">96-7) (Legis. Hist.) </span>at 325. The Committee Report accompanying that bill states that "[t]he effect of [section 7106] is to place limits on the number of subjects about which agency management may bargain with a labor organization." <span class="Italic">See </span>H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403 at 43 (1978); <span class="Italic">Legis. Hist. </span>at 689. Further, the report indicates that the purpose of section 7106 "is to achieve a broadening of the scope of bargaining" from that under Executive Order 11491 which governed federal sector labor relations before enactment of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Comments by congressmen during the debate over what was to become the Statute confirm that section 7106 was intended to limit what unions could bargain over. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, Statement of Congressman Clay, 124 Cong. Rec. E4293 (daily ed. Aug. 3, 1998); <span class="Italic">Legis. Hist. </span>at 839 (the bill "preserved for agency management the right to keep off the bargaining table those prerogatives which the committee believes are essential for them to manage."). Finally, the Conference Report, in reconciling the Senate and House bills, characterized section 7106 of the House bill and section 7128 of the Senate bill as "speci[fying] matters on which the parties may not negotiate under any circumstances and certain other matters on which the agency may, in its discretion negotiate." H.R. Rep. No. 95-1717 at 153 (1978); Legis. Hist. at 821.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the interpretation that section 7106 acts as a limit on the scope of bargaining, the Authority has applied section 7106(a) in two contexts, both which involve the ability of unions, through the bargaining process, to affect the exercise of management's rights. Most frequently section 7106(a) is applied as a direct limit on the scope of bargaining. That is, bargaining proposals or contract provisions will be found, in certain circumstances, to be outside an agency's obligation to bargain if they impermissibly affect the exercise of any of the enumerated rights of section 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Locals R5-136 and R5-150 and U.S. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs, Ralph H. Johnson Medical Center, Charleston,</span> <span class="Italic">South Carolina, </span>55 FLRA 679, 682-84 (1999). In addition, section 7106(a) may act as a limit on remedies issued by arbitrators. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington,</span> <span class="Italic">D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter</span> <span class="Italic">201, </span>53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Unlike the Authority, whose remedial powers are based on statute, the authority of arbitrators is a product of the collective bargaining agreement. As the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement cannot impermissibly affect managements rights, neither could a ruling of an arbitrator acting on the authority of such an agreement. In each context, 7106(a) operates as a limit on the ability of unions, through the bargaining process, to affect the exercise of management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA, </span>494 U.S. 922, 928 (1990) <span class="Italic">(IRS v. FLRA), </span>the Supreme Court emphasized Congress's use of the phrase "nothing in this chapter" in section 7106 in holding that the provisions of section 7121 of the Statute are subject to the command of section 7106. However, we do not believe that the decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA </span>is inconsistent with the view that section 7106 is intended only as a limit on the scope of bargaining. <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA </span>was a review of an Authority negotiability determination and the question before the Court was whether the agency was obligated to bargain over proposals that would subject certain decisions concerning contracting out to the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. In finding the proposal to be outside the agency's obligation to bargain, the Court concluded that unions could not rely on other sections of the Statute to render negotiable a proposal that otherwise interfered with a right enumerated in section 7106(a). 494 U.S. at 928-32. However, the Court only analyzed section 7106(a) in the context of the obligation to bargain question presented in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;Congress Intended to Provide the Authority with Broad Remedial Powers</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is in section 7118(a)(7)--not section 7106--where Congress speaks specifically to the scope of the Authority's remedial power in unfair labor practice cases. That section sets forth certain specific remedies and grants authority to order "such other action as will carry out the purposes of this chapter." Thus, the broad grant of remedial power is tempered only by reference to the purpose of the Statute, which embodies the balance of interests between and among employees, unions, and agencies. No other limitations are expressed. The breadth of the Authority's remedial power in unfair labor practice cases has been recognized in a variety of contexts. <span class="Italic">See United States Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Safford, Arizona,</span> 35 FLRA 431, 444 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Safford</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. FLRA, </span>685 F.2d 547 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); <span class="Italic">see also National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union v. FLRA, </span>910 F.2d 964, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990) <span class="Italic">(en banc),</span> The United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has found that Congress intended the Authority to have remedial authority in unfair labor practice cases similar to that granted the NLRB under the National Labor Relations Act. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA, </span>785 F.2d 333, 336 (D.C. Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">(AFGE v. FLRA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Interpreting section 7106(a) as a direct limit on the Authority's remedial powers would be inconsistent with Congress's clear intent to provide the Authority with broad remedial authority. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Menasche, </span>348 U.S. 528, 538-39 (1955) ("It is our duty 'to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,' <span class="Italic">Inhabitants of Montclair Tp. v. Ramsdell</span>, 107 U.S. 147, 152...rather than to emasculate an entire section, as the Government's interpretation requires."); <span class="Italic">see also Clark v. Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, A.G.,</span> 332 U.S. 480, 488-89 (1947) (court cannot "impute to Congress a purpose to paralyze with one hand what it sought to promote with the other).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Drawing on private sector precedent, the Authority has identified as the essential purposes of its remedial authority to restore, so far as possible, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained but for the wrongful act and to deter future misconduct<span class="Italic">. Department of Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Dependents Schools, </span>54 FLRA 259, 269 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J.H. Rutter-Rex Manufacturing Co., </span>396 U.S. 258, 265 (1969), and <span class="Italic">Local 60, United Brotherhood of</span> <span class="Italic">Carpenters and Joiners v. NLRB, </span>365 U.S. 651, 659 (1961)). If section 7106 were to be applied in the manner the Respondents urge here, the Authority would be hampered in its ability to order such relief and deter such conduct in the future.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;Although this case involves only the potential impact of section 7106 on remedies, the implications of this analysis are equally applicable to an underlying statutory violation. For example, it is an unfair labor practice to discipline an employee for the exercise of rights protected under section 7102 of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Department of Commerce,</span> <span class="Italic">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National</span> <span class="Italic">Ocean Service, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Aeronautical</span> <span class="Italic">Charting Division, Washington, D.C., </span>54 FLRA 987, 1009-11 (1998) <span class="Italic">(NOAA). </span>But if the section 7106(a) right to discipline predominates over all other sections of the Statute, then it would follow that section 7102 could not limit the ability of an agency to discipline an employee. Similarly, the Authority has held that investigatory techniques are within the scope of the agency's right to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Federal Prison Council 33 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 51 FLRA 1112, 1115-16 (1996). But, again, if the management right predominates, then that right would, at least in theory, negate the <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>right to representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B). In our view, section 7106 cannot be read as being so dominant that it negates congressionally-mandated, fundamental rights found in other parts of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the present case, if section 7106(a) were read to limit the posting remedy, the Authority would be denied the power to exercise its discretion in adequately remedying the violation. The Authority has recognized that a component of recreating the conditions and relationships that would have been had there been no unfair labor practice is "promoting employee confidence in the rights and procedures established by the Statute." <span class="Italic">Safford, </span>35 FLRA at 448. Directing a specific high-ranking official to take certain actions is a recognized and approved method of remedying violations of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NASA v. FLRA, </span>119 S. Ct. 1979, 1989 (1999) (upholding Authority's order that agency head direct Inspector General to comply with section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute). To limit the Authority's ability to fashion such a remedy would frustrate the Authority's duty to vindicate the policies of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA, </span>785 F.2d at 338.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The Authority's Remedial Practices Are Consistent with the Purposes and Policies of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although section 7106(a) does not act as a limitation on unfair labor practice remedies, the Statute requires that remedies must "effectuate the policies of the Statute." <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne,</span> <span class="Italic">Wyoming, </span>52 FLRA 149, 160 (1996). For example, the Authority has found that remedies may not be punitive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, nontraditional remedies will be fashioned only where traditional remedies will not "adequately redress the wrong incurred by the unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">NOAA, </span>54 FLRA at 1021-22 (finding that an order to discipline specific supervisors not required to remedy unfair labor practice).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1667"></span>From its inception, the Authority has established remedial principles specifically tailored to the requirements of the federal sector. Recognizing Congress's dictate that the Statute be interpreted in a manner consistent with an effective and efficient government, the Authority applies a balancing test to determine if <span class="Italic">status quo ante </span>(SQA) remedies are appropriate in cases where agencies have exercised their reserved rights without completing their obligation to bargain the impact and implementation of that exercise. <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional</span> <span class="Italic">Institution, </span>8 FLRA 604, 606 (1982) <span class="Italic">(FCI). </span>In these cases the Authority balances the nature and circumstances of the particular violation and the degree of disruption to government operations that would be caused by an SQA remedy<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The D.C. Circuit has found that the <span class="Italic">FCI </span>test "respects management's statutory authority" when government efficiency is truly jeopardized and constitutes a reasonable framework for reconciling competing statutory purposes. <span class="Italic">AFGE, SSA Council 220,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO v. FLRA, </span>840 F.2d 925, 929 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, rather than simply directing make-whole remedies in a mechanistic fashion in all cases where a statutory violation has occurred, the Authority has instead adopted a measured approach that considers the totality of the circumstances, including both employee rights and government operations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 447 (Where representation rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B) have been violated and an employee has subsequently been disciplined, the Authority will not order the agency to rescind the disciplinary action. Rather the Authority will order the agency to repeat the investigative interview with full representation rights, and in light of the results of the interview, reconsider any disciplinary action taken against the employee). As the cases cited herein demonstrate, the Authority has exercised its remedial power in a manner that "will protect employee rights and promote the efficiency of government[.]" <span class="Italic">Safford, </span>35 FLRA 448.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Respondents Have Not Demonstrated That the Recommended Remedy Would Interfere with its Right to Assign Work</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if we were to conclude that Authority remedial orders were subject to a management's rights analysis analogous to that employed in negotiability cases, Respondents have not demonstrated that requiring the Bureau's Director to sign the posting would interfere with the right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents cite only <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers</span>, 51 FLRA at 739 to support their argument that the requiring the Bureau's Director to sign the posting interferes with their management right to assign work. However, the proposal at issue in that case did not require the assignment of a duty to a particular person or position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, the proposal there would have authorized teachers to leave work under specified circumstances. The Authority found the proposal interfered with the right to assign work because it would have prohibited the assignment of duties under those circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As such, <span class="Italic">Laurel Bay Teachers </span>does not support the Respondent's assertion or the conclusion that the recommended remedy affects the section 7106(a)(2)(B) right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are unaware of any case where the Authority has considered, in a negotiability case, a proposal or provision involving the signing of an occasional, nonrecurring document such as the unfair labor practice notice at issue in this case. We note in this regard that finding an effect on management's right is not necessarily dispositive of negotiability in light of section 7106(b)(2) and (3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we also note that prior precedent has stated that matters "merely incidental to the accomplishment of the Agency's mission and functions" do not affect management's section 7106(a) rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2050</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, </span>35 FLRA 706, 715 (1990); <span class="Italic">cf. National Treasury Employees</span> <span class="Italic">Union v. FLRA, </span>793 F.2d 371, 374 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (The term "assign work" was "not meant to be so expansive as to include whatever is useful for getting the agency's work done in a particular manner of priority, but [was] rather [a] description[&#8197;] of a precise, defined management activity."). As such, the specific requirement that the Director of the Bureau sign the posting is principally related to the protection of the employees' statutory rights and not the accomplishment of the agency's mission. As the Authority has found, the purpose of such a requirement is to "signif[y] that the Respondent acknowledges its obligations under the Statute and intends to comply with those obligations." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C.,</span> 48 FLRA 1400, 1402 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the Respondent's argument here were carried to its illogical extreme, the Authority could never direct any particular management official to ever sign any notice or, for that matter, take any remedial action whatsoever. For reasons noted above, such an illogical interpretation finds no support in the Statute and would be inconsistent with remedial authority we have previously exercised. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kansas,</span> 55 FLRA 704, 721 (1999) (Authority directed a meeting of all employees wherein the Warden would either read, or be present during the reading of, a remedial unfair labor practice notice.)<span id="page_1668"></span></p>
