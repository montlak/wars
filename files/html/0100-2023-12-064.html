<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-64"><span class="space">a.</span> Short Form Order</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board trades off quick and quality decisions. With a given number of attorneys toiling away on these cases, either careful decisions are written about each case with delays in the adjudicative process resulting from the need to draft and rewrite opinions, or summary opinions are issued in more cases in less time. The latter approach was adopted until the advent of nonprecedential final orders in 2010. Many decisions issuing from Board Headquarters were two-page statements of appeal rights coupled with a sentence announcing that the PFR was denied. There was the occasional footnote citing a case or two that could be of some importance in the delphic analysis. Starting in 1988, as the Board's workload declined, the Board issued more decisions with some substantive discussion, but frequently the decisions did no more than modify, but not reverse, decisions of AJs who made insubstantial analytical errors. Although the use of one-line opinions diminished and later ceased, the Board held, naturally, that its short form treatment of many petitions for review satisfied its adjudicative responsibilities: an initial decision sufficient in form and content may be adopted by the Board and withstand judicial review without separate elaboration of the factors prompting the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 16 MSPR 178, 183 n.7 (1983); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Medina v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3287) ("[T]he Board need not consider the full merits of every properly presented petition but has broad discretion as to whether to accept a petition for review[.]" (citing <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the "short form" opinion vexed the parties and counsel who put time into PFRs, and although summary decisions created additional litigation if the issues ignored by the Board then had to be reviewed in the courts, the Board's practice found judicial acceptance, <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the statute that precludes the Board from limiting its review of initial decisions to cases coming within one of these two categories. The Board has a huge volume of appeals from adverse actions by agencies against employees. If the Board itself were required to review the merits of every case presented to it--as the petitioner apparently would require it to do--it would soon become hopelessly bogged down in an unmanageable load of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's present method of review enables the Board to concentrate on the relatively small number of cases that present important and novel legal issues or in which newly discovered evidence warrants further consideration. At the same time the Board's procedures leave it to the presiding officials to adjudicate the large number of routine factual and legal questions that arise in employee appeals. The Board did not abuse its broad discretion to prescribe its own procedures by adopting this system of discretionary review of its presiding officials' initial decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language the Board used in denying review is a standard formulation the Board customarily employs in most of the cases in which it denies review. The petitioner objects that the Board was required to do more and to explain in detail why it rejected each of the grounds upon which the petitioner sought reversal of the presiding examiner's decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board properly utilizes this procedure in disposing of those appeals in which it discerns nothing warranting plenary consideration. The Board's order explained why it denied review. It did so because the petition for review did not "meet the criteria for review set forth" in 5 CFR 1201.115....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the petitioner may disagree with the initial decision, the latter adequately explained the reasons why the presiding official dismissed the appeal. The presiding official's discussion of the issues in the case enables us to perform our statutory review function.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1389 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("While the requirement to issue a published decision might represent better public policy, the Board contends that we lack the power to impose such a requirement. We agree."). Parenthetically, it is noted that the Federal Circuit disposes of many appeals from the Board through summary affirmation, the equivalent of MSPB short-form decisions. [Federal Circuit review procedures are discussed in <a href="0100-2023-24-001.html#sec17-1">Chapter 17</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When short form orders were in vogue, a lawsuit was filed against the Board to force disclosure of these justifications under the Freedom of Information Act, and the plaintiff prevailed: the Board was relying upon the justifications and essentially incorporating them by reference into its decisional process, <span class="Italic">Martin v. MSPB</span>, No. 81-2471 (D.D.C. 1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiffs claim that the advisory memoranda are not protected by the attorney work-product privilege. There is merit in this claim since the court of appeals has made it clear that this privilege "has uniformly been held to be limited to documents prepared in contemplation of litigation." <span class="Italic">Coastal States Gas Corp.</span>, 617 F.2d at 864. The defendants have failed to show that these documents are used to prepare for litigation. Moreover, these advisory memoranda, because of their limited function, would be unlikely to be of use in subsequent litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1645"></span>The documents in question are "predecisional" and "deliberative" by nature, that is, they were created before the adoption of policy and as a part of the consultation process. Consequently, they would ordinarily be protected by those policies underlying the deliberative process privilege.... These memoranda would only lose this protection if, as plaintiffs argue, they have been incorporated into or adopted by the final agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has clearly elucidated the standard by which the incorporation argument must be judged: "[I]f an agency chooses <span class="Italic">expressly</span> to adopt or incorporate by reference an intra-agency memorandum previously covered by exemption 5 in what would otherwise be a final opinion, that memorandum may be withheld only on the ground that it falls within the coverage of some exemption other than Exemption 5: <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck &#x0026; Co.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 421 U.S. at 161 (emphasis in original). Defendants place great weight on the Supreme Court's use of the word "expressly." Yet the Court is persuaded that incorporation or adoption by reference may also be inferred from all of the facts in a case, especially from a document's position in the decisionmaking process and its use by the agency. Moreover, the Board's vote sheets could be read to expressly agree with the staff recommendation and hence the advisory memoranda. <span class="Italic">See</span> note 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court concludes, under the facts of this case, that the two advisory memoranda have been adopted in the final Board decisions. Several facts compel this conclusion. First, the vote sheets prepared for the Board decision are structured so that the Board either accepts, rejects, or asks for modification of the staff recommendation from the Appeals Office.[1] The rationale for this recommendation is set forth in the advisory memorandum, not in the draft order. Indeed, the Board's "decision" in these cases is represented by form orders which contain no supporting rationale at all. Moreover, if, in either of these cases, the proposed decision had been rejected and sent back to the Appeals Office, not only would a new order have been submitted but also a revised advisory memorandum would have been sent back. In these cases, the rationale for the Board decision, insofar as it exists, is set out in the memorandum, not in the orders that were issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Defendants argue that the vote sheets indicate agreement or disagreement with the draft order, not the advisory memorandum. The vote sheets are to some extent ambiguous, but it seems that the decision to agree, disagree, or modify applies to both the memorandum and order since both are sent back to the Office of Appeals for modification if the Board members do not accept the recommendation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Defendants argue that the Board may have made its decision on grounds other than those contained in the memorandum and that the Board members are not bound by the rationale set forth in the memoranda even if they accept the staff recommendation. Nonetheless, the Board's disposition of these cases is evidenced by terse <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> orders which give no indication of why the Board acted as it did.[2] In the absence of a reasoned Board decision, the inference arises that the Board acted on the basis of the staff recommendation.[3] The Board has not rebutted this inference. Thus the staff recommendations, while they may not be precedent for future Board cases, are the controlling law of the individual cases before the Board, and the policies underlying the FOIA mandate disclosure of the rationale underlying those recommendations which the Board adopts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The orders in these cases merely state that the Board finds that the request for review "does not meet the criteria for review set forth at [the former] 5 CFR 1201.155."...There is no analysis of any issues raised in the petitions for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;This does not mean that the Board must write opinions in cases such as these if it would otherwise not be required to do so.... However, it does mean that parties to proceedings before the Board must be given access to information that reveals the basis of the Board's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court's decision today is relatively narrow. The advisory memoranda must be disclosed only when the Board votes to accept the staff recommendation without providing any other statement of the Board's reasons. If the Board issues more than the form orders involved in these cases or if the Board rejects the staff recommendation, the advisory memoranda need not be disclosed. Common sense and fairness require that the Board reveal the underlying reasons for its actions to those who appear before it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board claimed in the FOIA litigation that the justifications were not accessible under the Privacy Act because they were not permanently stored with the case files. That issue was not decided, however, and it may be that if a document should be included in a record system, excision by the agency will not render the document inaccessible under the Privacy Act. Without regard to the requirements of the Privacy Act, the Board for some time effectively mooted the <span class="Italic">Martin</span> decision by destroying OAC recommendations immediately after they were reviewed by the Board members. Board Order 1556.9 of April 10, 1996, known as its "Records Manual," contained a table describing the retention schedule for various MSPB documents that are electronically generated or stored. As to the OAC case memos that "customarily contain summaries of the facts and a discussion of the issues of law arising in the case," the retention schedule calls for Board personnel to dispense with them as follows: "Destroy when the draft order is approved and signed, unless the memoranda contain research valuable as reference for similar cases. If the memoranda do contain valuable reference material, file them under the subject of interest."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OAC shredders went into semi-retirement when the Board then decided that the OAC memos had some value, for they contained the analysis of case law necessary to support the result achieved in a short-form decision. After pondering how to keep the analyses and avoid disclosure, the Board decided it would change its voting form to indicate that by agreeing to adopt a short-form decision prepared by OAC, the Board did not necessarily adopt the reasoning expressed in the supporting OAC analysis. While the Board was toying with its voting sheet to make it appear that an OAC memo was not indirectly incorporated into the Board decision, the Board decided that the memos collectively contained so much good research that they should be collected on the Board's computerized database where they would be available, collectively, to Board attorneys who research and write proposed decisions for Board members. Opinions of the Board's lawyers suggested that inclusion of an OAC memo on the database, retrievable by the appellant's name or identifier, made the record subject to Privacy Act (although not, given its predecisional nature, FOIA) disclosure, presumably meaning that it would be subject to disclosure to the appellant, if not the public. The database, on information and belief, now contains analysis but without personal identifiers, so it would be available under FOIA if it is still maintained (a lot of research by AJs and OAC attorneys, and likely Board members and their staff is now conducted on commercial databases).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2000, the practice was that the Board would disclose an OAC memo to an appellant (or her counsel) who requested it under the Privacy Act and to others to the extent the document was deemed releasable under FOIA. Despite a paucity of requests for OAC memos, in the latter part of 2000 the Board's leadership apparently became distressed about release of the documents and purged the database of the names of appellants, meaning that the records were no longer retrievable by name through the Privacy Act. The result was that appellants could not readily obtain the OAC memos relied on by Board members who voted to issue short-form decisions. To what extent the OAC memos will now be accessible under FOIA remains to be seen. The increased use of nonprecedential final orders, rather than short form decisions, suggests that OAC analytical memos will not be of much interest to parties, the bar, or the litigious author.</p>
