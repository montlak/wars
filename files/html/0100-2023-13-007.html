<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-8"><span class="space">2.</span> Proposal to Enforce Agency Regulations and Policies</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although Title VII of the Reform Act defines "grievance" to include any complaint of a claimed violation of any law, rule, or regulation affecting "conditions of employment," in turn defined to include "personnel policies, practices, and matters, whether established by rule, regulation, or otherwise," 5 USC 7103(a)(9), (14), unions often seek to incorporate by reference into their contracts agency regulations or rules governing personnel practices, so that employees can grieve violations of those practices. Whatever the merits of that approach, given the broad definition of "grievance," FLRA spent a fair amount of time trying to explain what the union may properly seek to incorporate into the contract. Agencies argue that if policies are placed into a contract, they are frozen for the duration of the contract and are beyond the right of management to alter during that term. Other disputes involve areas of management authority, e.g., internal security or classification, that are nonnegotiable. Management may also be concerned with the distinction between internal agency regulations, that is, regulations affecting only agency employees, and external regulations that affect employees (or others) government wide, including the agency employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 42 FLRA 527, 534-41 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv. V. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (court decision is discussed later in this chapter in the section on appropriate arrangements), clarified the negotiability of contract provisions that seek to enforce external law, as it held negotiable as an arrangement a proposal that the contract include the agreement by the agency to comply with its regulations governing personnel policies and practices:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Management Rights under Section 7106 of the Statute</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">1. <span class="Italic">Analytical Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal encompasses all existing Agency regulations concerning personnel policies and practices and general conditions of employment.&#x2003;As is discussed in more detail below, it is clear and undisputed that the proposal would require compliance with existing Agency regulations affecting or constituting the exercise of management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute. We note, however, that the proposal would not incorporate the terms of the Agency's regulations into the parties' agreement and, therefore, to the extent the regulations affected or constituted the exercise of a management right, the proposal would not impose an independent contractual restriction on such right. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of Treasury, Financial Management Service</span>, 29 FLRA 422, 426-27 (1987) (provision restating portions of Government-wide regulation concerning performance appraisal held to constitute independent contractual limitation on, and interfere with, management's rights to assign work and direct employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, the Authority held that proposals requiring an agency to exercise its management rights in accordance with existing regulations were negotiable<span class="Italic">. For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1497 and Department of Air Force, Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado</span>, 9 FLRA 151, 156 (1982). The Authority held that such proposals did not interfere with the exercise of management's rights because they merely required the agency to comply with existing limitations on those rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Recently, the Authority reexamined its previous approach to this issue in light of the Supreme Court's holding in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> that the Statute "does not empower unions to enforce all 'external limitations' on management rights, but only limitations contained in 'applicable laws.'"...&#8197;More particularly, as discussed below, the Authority has drawn a distinction between management rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute and those rights encompassed by section 7106(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to management's rights under section 7106(a)(1), the Authority has held that as the "literal wording of section 7106(a)(1)...does not contain a requirement that management exercise its rights enumerated in that section 'in accordance with applicable laws[,]'" a proposal requiring management to do so directly interferes with such rights. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Department of Education Council of AFGE Locals and U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1076 (1990) (Member Talkin dissenting as to other matters) (<span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>), <span class="Italic">request for reconsideration denied</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed sub nom. United States Department of Education v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-1219 (D.C. Cir. May 10, 1991). The Authority also held, however, that the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute is subject to section 7106(b). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, a proposal requiring management to exercise its section 7106(a)(1) rights in accordance with applicable laws may be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 1077.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute are expressly subject to applicable laws. In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA No. 31 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), we held that insofar as section 7106(a)(2) rights are concerned, proposals that require compliance with applicable laws do not interfere with the exercise of such rights. We also held, for reasons discussed fully in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, that the term "applicable laws" in section 7106(a)(2) includes, among other things, rules and regulations having "the force and effect of law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS</span> we held that agency regulations must have certain substantive and procedural characteristics in order to constitute regulations having the force and effect of law. Specifically, agency regulations have the force and effect of law, so as to constitute applicable laws, if they: (1) are promulgated pursuant to an explicit or implicit delegation of legislative authority by Congress; (2) affect individual rights and obligations; and (3) are promulgated in accordance with applicable procedural requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, slip op. at 15-17. Like rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) are subject to section 7106(b). Accordingly, proposals that directly interfere with the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) may be negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, proposals that require an agency to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute in accordance with applicable laws, as defined in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, do not directly interfere with those rights. However, proposals that require compliance with applicable laws in the exercise of rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute do directly interfere with those rights. Nevertheless, proposals that directly interfere with rights under section 7106(a)(1) or (2) may be negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2. <span class="Italic">Application of the Analytical Framework to this Case</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. <span class="Italic">Direct Interference</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted previously, the proposal applies to all existing Agency regulations governing personnel policies and practices and general conditions of employment. Consistent with the plain wording of the proposal, and the Agency's undisputed assertions, we find that the proposal encompasses regulations affecting the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the proposal encompasses Agency regulations affecting the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, it would require the Agency to exercise such rights in accordance with whatever limitations exist in the regulations. That is, the proposal would require compliance with existing "external limitations" on the exercise of such rights. <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1076. As such, the proposal directly interferes with the exercise of the Agency's rights under section 7106(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_492"></span>The proposal also would require compliance with Agency regulations affecting the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.[3] Insofar as these regulations constitute applicable laws, as defined in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the proposal would not directly interfere with the Agency's section 7106(a)(2) rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;It is undisputed that existing Agency regulations encompass a table of disciplinary penalties and address such other matters as performance appraisals and leave....&#8197;It also is undisputed that these regulations affect, and/or result from the exercise of, the Agency's section 7106(a)(2) rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record before us does not provide a basis on which to determine whether the Agency's regulations constitute applicable laws. However, consistent with the Agency's undisputed assertions that it "issues few regulations, in the technical sense[,]"...and that most of the regulations encompassed by the proposal are written Agency policies or directives, it is reasonable to assume that the proposal would encompass at least some regulations which do not constitute applicable laws. It also is reasonable to assume, and there is no assertion to the contrary, that at least some of the disputed regulations contain substantive restrictions on the Agency's section 7106(a)(2) rights. Accordingly, without addressing whether requiring compliance with existing regulations which do not contain such substantive limitations would directly interfere with such rights, we find that to the extent the proposal requires compliance with Agency regulations containing substantive restrictions on the exercise of management's rights, the proposal directly interferes with the exercise of the Agency's rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b. <span class="Italic">Deliberative Process</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we conclude that the proposal directly interferes with the exercise of the Agency's rights under section 7106(a)(1) and (2) of the Statute, we reject, as unsupported, the Agency's argument that the proposal would enable the Union improperly to interject itself into the Agency's deliberative processes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]nsofar as the Agency is arguing that the proposal improperly would allow the substitution of an arbitrator's judgment for that of the Agency in the exercise of management rights, that argument was addressed and rejected in <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 635-37 (1987) ("[t]he question of any impermissible arbitral interference with management's rights must be directed to the merits, including remedy, of an arbitration decision"). Stated simply, an agency's "concern that an arbitrator's judgment may be substituted for its own is not a basis for finding [a proposal] nonnegotiable." <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 346, 350 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c. <span class="Italic">Appropriate Arrangement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we address whether the proposal is intended as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, and whether the proposal is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National. Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that it advanced the proposal "to protect bargaining unit employees who have an interest in a regulation affecting their employment."...&#8197;The Union asserts that the proposal "seeks to establish an evenness in the [A]gency's application of personnel regulations" and that "aspects of the proposal include an equitable right to rely on a personnel regulation, both in its direct application in a consistent manner, and its fair application among several employees."...&#8197;It is clear that employees have an "interest in maintaining the protections afforded them under...applicable...regulations...." <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1078. It also is clear that employees may be "adversely affected," within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, by Agency actions taken in disregard of existing regulatory requirements. We conclude, therefore, that the proposal is Intended as and constitutes an arrangement for employees who are adversely affected by the exercise of a management right in a manner inconsistent with existing Agency regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we must determine whether the proposed arrangement is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management rights. To do so, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers." <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32. In this case, we conclude that the benefits afforded employees by the proposal outweigh the impact on management's rights resulting from it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the benefit afforded employees by the proposal is significant. The proposal would provide employees with clear assurance that the Agency intended to comply with its regulatory requirements. Moreover, the proposal would enable employees to challenge alleged noncompliance through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. Providing access to negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures to challenge an agency's compliance with its regulations constitutes a significant benefit....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the impact of the proposal on management's rights is minimal. We note that the Agency "does not take issue with the proposition that it is obliged to follow its own regulations."...&#8197;Indeed, "[i]t is a familiar rule of administrative law that an agency must abide by its own regulations." <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 2051 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as noted previously, the proposal applies only to existing Agency regulations. The proposal neither precludes the Agency from revising or rescinding any issued regulation nor obligates the Agency to issue any regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The benefit conferred by the proposal on unit employees is significant.&#x2003;With respect to the impact of the proposal on management's rights, however, the Agency has not "asserted an interest in acting without regard to its regulation[s] and no such interest is apparent to us."...&#8197;Accordingly, we conclude that the benefit afforded employees by the proposal outweighs the impact of the proposal on management's rights. Therefore, the proposal does not excessively interfere with the exercise of the Agency's rights under section 7106 of the Statute and constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">More succinctly, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and INS</span>, 51 FLRA 1308, 1315-16 (1996), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the provision may mirror an agency practice or proposal does not render it negotiable.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 46 FLRA at 779; <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-144, Federal Union of Scientists and Engineers and U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 38 FLRA 456, 473 (1990), <span class="Italic">remanded as to other matters</span>, No. 91-1045 (D.C. Cir. July 23, 1991). As a general matter, an agency cannot be required through collective bargaining to exercise its management rights in accordance with external limitations. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Department of Education Council of AFGE Locals and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Education, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1075-76 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Dept. of Education), request for reconsideration denied</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991), <span class="Italic">reversed as to</span> <span class="Italic">other matters, U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals</span> <span class="Italic">Management Service, New Orleans, Louisiana v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Minerals Management Service</span>). Consequently, proposals requiring that an agency exercise its management rights in accordance with law and regulation interfere with those rights. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1075-76. As an exception to this general rule, proposals that require an agency to exercise section 7106(a)(2) management rights in accordance with law and regulations do not interfere with those rights as long as those authorities constitute "applicable laws" within the meaning of that section. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA 377 (1991) (<span class="Italic">IRS), reversed as to other matters</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993). For an external limitation to constitute "applicable law" within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), it must have certain substantive and procedural characteristics, as described in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>. 42 FLRA at 391-93. In sum, while an agency may through practice or regulation exercise its rights under section 7106(a) in a particular manner, under extant Authority and judicial precedent, it cannot be required to commit itself through a bilateral agreement with a union to exercise those rights in that manner.[7] <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</span>, 38 FLRA 59, 62 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We leave for an appropriate case exploration of whether under some circumstances an agency may, through a collective bargaining agreement, commit itself to adhere to its own rules and regulations when exercising management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the first sentence mirrors an Agency proposal as to what will be included in its Administrative Manual, there is no argument here that the Administrative Manual constitutes applicable law. Therefore, the first sentence of this provision is outside the duty to bargain unless it constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Public Debt</span>, 42 FLRA 1333, 1339 (1991)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Guidance concerning contract proposals seeking to permit enforcement of external law is also provided by <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 38 FLRA 1068, 1074 (1990), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, 39 FLRA 1241 (1991), involving a proposal that the employer agree that its drug testing program proceed in compliance with the Constitution and applicable laws and regulations. Distinguishing proposals concerning management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) (mission, budget, organization, number of employees, internal security practices) and management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) (assignment of work, selection and assignment of employees), FLRA determined in its underlying decision that the proposal was negotiable as an arrangement, 38 FLRA at 1075-78:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_493"></span>The Authority consistently has held that although section 7106(a) reserves to management the right to take the actions enumerated therein, management's rights under section 7106(a) must be exercised in accordance with applicable laws and regulations....&#8197;[S]ection 7106(a)(1) does not preclude a union from negotiating proposals that require an agency to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation or from enforcing such provisions through the negotiated grievance procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>), leads us to reexamine the Authority's conclusion...that the Statute does not preclude a union from negotiating proposals that require an agency to comply with applicable law, rule, or regulation when the agency exercises its rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, the Court, interpreting section 7106(a)(2), held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The [Statute] does not empower unions to enforce all "external limitations" on management rights, but only limitations contained in "applicable laws." Or to put the point differently, there <span class="Italic">are</span> no "external limitations" on management rights, insofar as union powers under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are concerned, other than the limitations imposed by "applicable laws."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Court's conclusion was based on the literal wording of section 7106(a)(2), which provides that "nothing [in the Statute] shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency...in accordance with applicable laws" to exercise the management rights enumerated under section 7106(a)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The literal wording of section 7106(a)(1), however does not contain a requirement that management exercise the rights enumerated in that section "in accordance with applicable laws." Given the wording of section 7106(a)(1), therefore, the logical extension of the Court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> is that nothing in section 7106(a) of the Statute would require management, in the context of a collective bargaining relationship, to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) in accordance with applicable laws. Further, consistent with the Court's conclusion, section 7106(a) of the Statute does not, standing alone, empower unions to enforce through collective bargaining any "external limitations" on the exercise of management rights under section 7106(a)(1), including those contained in applicable laws.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's decision to implement a drug testing program is an exercise of the agency's right under section 7106(a)(1) to establish internal security practices....&#8197;Consequently, we find that by requiring the Agency to exercise its rights to establish and administer a drug testing program in accordance with external legal limitations (that is, the United States Constitution, applicable laws, rules and regulations), Proposal 1 subjects the exercise of the Agency's rights under section 7106(a)(1) to the limits of applicable law and regulation. Because Proposal 1 would impermissibly limit the exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1), we find that the proposal directly interferes with that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have found in this case that section 7106(a) does not, by its terms, subject the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, section 7106(a) provides that management's authority under section 7106(a)(1) is "[s]ubject to" section 7106(b) of the Statute. That is, management's authority to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute is itself subject to subsection (b) of section 7106 of the Statute....&#8197;Thus, by the literal terms of section 7106 a proposal requiring management to exercise its rights under 7106(a) in accordance with "applicable law" may be negotiable if it constitutes a procedure under section 7106(b)(2) or if it constitutes an "appropriate arrangement." Section 7106(b)(3). [sic]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that directly interferes with a management right does not constitute a negotiable procedure under section 7106(b)(2)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Union contends that Proposal 1 constitutes an "appropriate arrangement" under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the proposal is "intended to alleviate the adverse [e]ffects of the exercise of a management right."...&#8197;We recognize that an agency's exercise of its right to implement a drug testing program could adversely affect employees. An employee subject to drug testing whose urine specimen tests positive will be subject to certain personnel actions, including reassignment, counseling or rehabilitation, or disciplinary action....&#8197;The proposal attempts to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Agency's establishment of its drug testing program by requiring the Agency to adhere to the limits established in the United States Constitution, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Consequently, we find that Proposal 1 is intended as, and constitutes, an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, that is, its right to establish a drug testing program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we must determine whether the proposed "arrangement" in Proposal 1 is "appropriate."...&#8197;[T]he proposal would allow challenges through the grievance and arbitration procedure to Agency actions concerning the establishment and administration of its drug testing program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, at the outset, that the imposition of drug testing is not within an employee's control. While an employee has control over his or her use of illegal drugs, an employee has no control over the testing methods and the procedures to safeguard the urine specimen or to ensure the accuracy of test results. In our view, moreover, employees' interest in maintaining the protections afforded them under the Constitution and applicable laws, rules and regulations outweighs the Agency's interest in insulating its actions from challenges through the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. The Agency has not demonstrated that a requirement that it act in a manner consistent with laws, rules and regulations excessively interferes with its right to determine internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1). Indeed, the existence of applicable laws, rules and regulations already serves to limit agency action and indicates that an agency's interest in being able to act without regard to those provisions and without challenge to the legality of its action, such as in arbitration procedures, is negligible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that, on balance, the benefits of the proposed arrangement to employees outweigh the adverse impact on the Agency's right. We conclude, therefore, that Proposal 1 does not excessively interfere with the Agency's right and is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of our finding in this case, we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE, National Council 236</span>, 27 FLRA 3 (1987), to the extent that it held that a requirement in a collective bargaining agreement that the agency exercise the rights enumerated in section 7106(a)(1) in accordance with external legal limitations does not interfere with the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1) and is enforceable in arbitration....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal calling on an agency to follow its own policies may be negotiable if management is free to change the policies or practices during the life of the contract, but the proposal must still avoid undue interference with a management right, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3509 and DHHS, SSA, Greenwood</span>, 46 FLRA 1590, 1617-18 (1993) (Proposal 23):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that are nonnegotiable because of interference with a management right do not become negotiable because they simply restate an existing agency policy or practice....&#8197;Because the inclusion of such a policy or practice in the agreement would prevent an agency from changing it during the life of the agreement, proposals restating that policy interfere with management rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority has also held that a provision that simply memorialized for informational purposes an agency's unilateral decision with respect to the exercise of a management right was negotiable in circumstances where it was clear that the agency remained free at any time during the life of the contract to change that decision after it fulfilled its obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change....</p>
