<p class="Body-Text">Reassignment involving loss of premium pay is not an adverse action. A reduction in pay under 5 USC 7512(4) refers to basic pay, not added differentials and bonuses. The loss of premium pay is not appealable as a reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">Nigg v. MSPB</span>, 321 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see Perkins v. MSPB</span>, 534 Fed. Appx. 988, 989 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("Our precedent has 'long distinguished between "basic pay" and "premium pay," such as overtime or night differential.' <span class="Italic">Nigg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 321 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). A denial of premium pay is not a reduction in pay that is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>."); <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Blattenberger</span>, 141 F. Supp. 513 (D.D.C. 1956) (decision predating the Reform Act: the termination of a night differential pay assignment was not an action subject to the procedural protections of the Veterans' Preference Act); <span class="Italic">Buckeit v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 52, 57 n.6, 2007 MSPB 224 (2007) (reassignment in anticipation of a possible RIF did not become a RIF or an otherwise appealable action when the appellant only lost opportunities for Sunday premium and night differential pay); <span class="Italic">Riojas v. USPS</span>, 88 MSPR 230, 233, 234 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 11 (2001) (EVA pay is equivalent to a bonus or premium pay; the loss of EVA pay is not a reduction in basic pay; the possible denial of a merit increase is not a reduction in pay when an employee has already received saved pay benefits above the maximum level of the assigned position); <span class="Italic">Liebeck v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 696, 698 (1998) (loss of premium pay is not an appealable reduction in basic pay: the courts interpret "rate of basic pay" narrowly, citing <span class="Italic">Wilson v. MSPB</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1986)); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 46 MSPR 154, 159 (1990) ("the Board does not have jurisdiction over reassignments and other agency actions involving only a loss of premium pay"); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 13 MSPR 521, 525 n.4 (1982) (noting that the appellant's assignment involved no change in grade or reduction in base pay); <span class="Italic">cf. Powers v. Gold</span>, 124 F. Supp. 93 (D. Mass. 1953) (no violation of law when the plaintiff returned, through reclassification, to a grade held prior to promotion to a position that was only conditionally classified at a higher level); <span class="Italic">Fair v. FAA</span>, 4 MSPR 493, 495-96, 5 MSPB 28 (1981) (basic pay is the term applied to an employee's rate of pay before deductions and exclusive of any kind of additional pay).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Loss of environmental differential pay for a period of administrative leave was not a reduction in basic pay and was not appealable. <span class="Italic">Moss v. DOD,</span> DC-0752-11-0142-I-1 (NP 10/26/2011). Night differential pay is not party of basic pay for purposes of Board jurisdiction over a pay reduction appeal. <span class="Italic">See Perkins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-315I-12-0162-I-1 (NP 12/5/2012). A reduction in physicians' comparability pay was not an appealable reduction in basic pay, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Dept. of Army,</span> AT-0752-11-0527-I-1 (NP 1/26/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellants seek review of the initial decisions dismissing, for lack of jurisdiction, their appeals alleging that the agency subjected them to a reduction in pay. On review, the appellants reiterate their argument that their Physicians Comparability Allowances (PCAs) are part of basic pay. As the administrative judge stated in the initial decision, however, the statute authorizing PCAs specifically states that the allowances should not be considered as basic pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5948(h)(1). The appellants argue that the administrative judge erred by failing to consider OPM Benefits Administration Letter No. 04-102, which determined that, consistent with the Federal Physicians Comparability Allowance Amendments of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-571, 114 Stat. 3054, PCAs should be considered as basic pay for retirement purposes, such as retirement deductions and benefits. However, a particular type of pay may be basic pay for some purposes but that does not necessarily make it basic pay for all purposes. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 6 n.2 (2002). Moreover, the appellants do not identify any law, rule, or regulation that extends the consideration of PCAs as basic pay for other purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Loss of premium pay should be distinguished from a dual appointment or <span id="Page_348"></span>special salary scale resulting in additional base pay that, when diminished by the agency, may constitute an appealable reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Kinnamon v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review a "reduction in pay." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4). "Pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). "By statute...the term 'reduction in pay' refers to a reduction in basic pay, not a reduction in premium pay." <span class="Italic">Nigg v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.,</span> 321 F.3d 1381, 1385 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The DOD NSPS performance payouts come from a pay pool consisting of three sources: (1) basic pay funds that were historically used on within-grade increases, quality-step increases, and promotions between General Schedule grade levels that no longer exist under NSPS; (2) government-wide general pay increases; and (3) bonus pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> Subchapter 1930.9.3.1 of DOD manual 1400.25-M. Under the pay pool approach, Bivings might have expected two types of payments from the pool: first, an increase in basic pay for the future and, second, a bonus for past performance. Because Bivings retired before the January NSPS performance payouts, he had no basis to claim increased basic pay. His only claim, therefore, is that he should have received a payment for past performance. Bivings argues that this performance payout is not a bonus, but part of basic pay under the new NSPS system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subchapter 1930.9.4 of DOD manual 1400.25-M makes clear that, apart from salary increases, NSPS payments are "bonuses." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 9901.342. The January performance-based payouts sought by Bivings are defined as "increases to base salaries, bonuses, or a combination of the two." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Since Bivings could not receive salary increases, the only payments he would have been entitled to would be bonuses. As the Board has no jurisdiction to review the denial of bonus pay, the Board had no jurisdiction to review the denial of Bivings's January 2008 performance-based payout.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A reassignment resulting in a loss of status within an organization and the potential for a lower bonus did not amount to a reduction in grade or pay for a member of the Postal Service Career Executive, <span class="Italic">Wilson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, preference eligible employees had a right to appeal to the Board's predecessor a "reduction in rank." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 (1976); <span class="Italic">Russell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner's duties and responsibilities (and therefore his rank) may have changed after his reassignment from San Francisco to Bakersfield. He had no right, however, to appeal to the Board a reassignment that had an effect on rank but did not result in a reduction in grade. The Board therefore correctly refused to accept jurisdiction of the petitioner's appeal on the basis that the reassignment from San Francisco to Bakersfield resulted in a reduction in responsibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner maintains, however, that under the position classification system of the Postal Service, the reassignment from a Category VI to a Category IV facility constituted a reduction in grade. The petitioner relies on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3), which states that "'grade' means a level of classification under a position classification system." The petitioner further points to the position classification system principles set out in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51, which provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The basis for determining the appropriate grade is the level of difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work of the class.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5106(b) (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the petitioner, under the position classification principles of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51, his reassignment from San Francisco to Bakersfield was a reduction in grade because it reduced the "difficulty" and "responsibility" of his position. The flaw in the argument is that 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51 does not apply to the petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, <span class="Italic">see supra</span> p. 1579, the Postal Service is an independent organization that is subject to only limited application of federal employment laws. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 410(a) (1982). Preference eligible employees of the Postal Service do not have the same rights as employees in the competitive service, but have only the limited rights granted by the Veterans' Preference Act. <span class="Italic">See Bredehorst v. United States,</span> 677 F.2d 87, 88-89 (Ct. Cl. 1982). The only rights the latter Act grants to Postal Service employees are those relating to the adverse actions specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7513, namely a removal, suspension for more than 14 days, furlough of 30 days or less, or reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">See Bredehorst,</span> 677 F.2d at 89. These rights do not include the application of the classification principles in 5 U.S.C. Chapter 51 to show that the reduction of the difficulty and responsibility of a new position was "a reduction in grade."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reduction in Pay.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner received the same salary in both San Francisco and Bakersfield. At oral argument, however, the petitioner contended that the reassignment reduced his pay because he would receive a smaller yearly bonus in Bakersfield than he would have received in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "pay," as applicable to this case, is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4) (1982). Because Congress intended adverse action rights such as the right to appeal a reduction in pay to be given a narrow construction, <span class="Italic">see Grasso v. Internal Revenue Service,</span> 657 F.2d 224, 225-26 (8th Cir. 1981) (citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 49, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad.News 2723, 2771), courts have interpreted the term "basic rate of pay" restrictively. Thus, an employee's basic rate of pay includes neither retirement benefits, <span class="Italic">see Grasso,</span> 657 F.2d at 225-26, nor premium pay, <span class="Italic">see Spinks v. United States Postal Service,</span> 621 F.2d 987 (9th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Triponi v. United States,</span> 224 Ct. Cl. 503, 633 F.2d 933 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like premium pay for a lower level Postal employee, bonuses for Postal executives are additional compensation above and beyond the executive's basic salary. Premium pay is designed to "offset the burdens of working generally disadvantageous hours," <span class="Italic">Spinks,</span> 621 F.2d at 988, while bonuses are designed to reward an executive for commendable performance, <span class="Italic">see infra</span> p. 1582. Neither premium pay nor bonuses are part of the employee's rate of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). Accordingly, we conclude that even if the petitioner's yearly bonus potentially may be smaller in Bakersfield than it would have been in San Francisco, that is insufficient to establish that he has been reduced in pay.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">COPRA's requirement that the appellant be available for overtime does not mean that overtime was part of his basic pay, and thus, that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal as a reduction in pay. In that regard, for purposes of Board adverse action jurisdiction, the term "pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). The rate of basic pay means "the rate of pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by a [General Schedule] employee before any deductions, including a [General Schedule] rate, a [law enforcement officer] special base rate, a special rate, a locality rate, and a retained rate, but exclusive of additional pay of any other kind." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.203.

Absent a statutory exception such as the one Congress created in the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act, reductions in premium pay are not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Nigg,</span> 321 F.3d at 1385. Therefore, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4) does not give the Board jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, COPRA's provision for overtime as part of basic pay for retirement purposes does not mean that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal as a reduction in pay. That portion of COPRA is found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(3)(G). That provision is inapplicable to this appeal, however, because by its terms it relates to the calculation of retirement benefits, not to the question of whether overtime is part of basic pay for purposes of establishing jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See Nigg</span>, 321 F.3d at 1385. Thus, the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he suffered a reduction in basic rate of pay.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 82 MSPR 294, 298 &#x00B6; 11 (1999), remanded for a determination of whether the shift from a position receiving "dive pay" constituted a reduction in basic pay and an appealable reduction in pay. The final Board decision was that there was no appealable reduction in pay, a result affirmed on judicial review, <span class="Italic">Pann v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 265 F.3d 1346, 1348-49 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that Mr. Pann's dive pay was "additional pay" within the meaning of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.202. Mr. Pann received dive pay only on those days when he performed diving duties. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 532.281(b) ("Employees who perform diving duties shall be paid 175 percent of the locality WG-10, step 2, rate for all payable hours of the shift."). Mr. Pann argues that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 532.281(e), which states that "[a]n employee's diving/tending rate shall be used as the basic rate of pay for computing all premium payments for a shift," compels a contrary conclusion. However, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 532.281(e) provides that dive pay is considered to be the diver's rate of basic pay only for purposes of calculating premium payments for dive shifts. The regulation thus indicates that except when used to calculate premium payments, such as overtime, dive pay is not normally considered part of the rate of basic pay for a Rigger (Diver), and that dive pay is therefore "additional pay." <span class="Italic">See Luciano</span>, 74 MSPR at 452-53 (noting that a provision stating that availability pay should be considered basic pay for certain purposes implied that it was not basic pay for other purposes, and was therefore "additional pay"). Taking Mr. Pann's argument to its logical extreme, if a Rigger (Diver) was not assigned diving duties on a particular day, or if he received fewer diving assignments in a particular time period than he had received in a previous time period, he could complain that he suffered a "reduction in pay" for that day or that time period. That is not what "reduction in pay" means, as the Board's decisions on this issue make clear. The Board therefore correctly construed dive pay as additional pay within the meaning of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 531.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pann cites <span class="Italic">Kinnamon v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 MSPR 274 (1992), for the proposition that a "special salary," such as dive pay, may qualify as part of an employee's basic pay. The administrative judge in Mr. Pann's case acknowledged that the Board in <span class="Italic">Kinnamon</span> had suggested that "some forms of 'special salary,' under certain circumstances, could be considered part of 'basic pay' for purposes of adverse action jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4)." However, <span class="Italic">Kinnamon</span> does not hold that all forms of "additional pay" are basic pay. The "special salary" at issue in <span class="Italic">Kinnamon</span> was compensation for performing various administrative duties pursuant to a permanent appointment to a position with the Uniformed Services University of Health Services. Mr. Kinnamon argued that he had been demoted to the position of professor at a substantially lower rate of basic pay, after serving in a different positions permanent administrative or dual administrative/professor position at a higher rate of basic pay. Based on the evidence proffered by Mr. Kinnamon, the Board held that Mr. Kinnamon was entitled to a hearing to establish that the "special salary" was a part of the full annual salary of the position from which he had been transferred and thus was part of his basic pay. Unlike Mr. Kinnamon, Mr. Pann received the same rate of basic pay in his Rigger (Diver) position as in his Rigger (Land) position, because the dive pay was not a fixed portion of his compensation, but depended on whether and how often he performed certain tasks within his job description. He was thus reassigned to a position having the same grade and rate of pay within the meaning of the Board's jurisdictional statute, even though his opportunities for earning additional pay were reduced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also not appealable was the loss of the 25% availability pay conferred by the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act of 1994 (LEAPA) when the loss resulted from reassignment out of a law enforcement position. The loss of pay may be appealed under some circumstances by individuals who remain in law enforcement positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 550.184(c-e) (2022). <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 71 MSPR 262 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. MSPB</span>, 126 F.3d 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>, resolved that although loss of the premium through reassignment out of a law enforcement position does not provide an appeal to the Board, investigators who lose availability pay by specific denial of certification of eligibility for the premium receive a statutory right of appeal, 71 MSPR at 264-66:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act of 1994 (LEAPA), 5 USC 5545a, criminal investigators are authorized availability pay, a premium pay equal to "25% of the rate of basic pay for the position," to ensure their availability for unscheduled duty in excess of a 40-hour work week based on the needs of the employing agency. The statute provides that availability pay shall be treated as part of basic pay for purposes of severance pay (5 USC 5595(c)), workers' compensation benefits (5 USC 8114(e)), Civil Service Retirement (5 USC 8331(3)), Thrift Savings Plan contributions (5 USC 8431), insurance (5 USC 8704(c)), and other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law, or as the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may provide by regulation. 5 USC 5545a(h)(2). OPM's regulations governing availability pay are found at 5 CFR 550.181-.187. Under those regulations, availability pay shall be treated as part of basic pay <span class="Italic">only</span> for the reasons provided in the statute and for advances in pay (5 USC 5524a). 4.186(b) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The specific designation in the statute of instances of availability pay being treated as basic pay gives rise to the inference that lack of designation should be understood as an exclusion. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sutherland, Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 47.23 (5th ed.). Thus, we find that availability pay is only part of basic pay for the specific purposes stated in the statute and regulations. Personnel matters generally deemed to be within managerial discretion, such as reassignments, are not delineated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the legislative history of the LEAPA emphasizes that the statute provides a premium pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 286, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 99-100 (1994); H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 741, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 56-57 (1994). Congress regularly referred to availability pay as premium pay, both in the legislative history and in the statute, and codified the LEAPA in the Premium Pay subchapter of the Pay Administration chapter of the Code, 5 USC Chapter 55, Subchapter V.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that premium pay is not part of basic pay, and the loss of or reduction in premium pay, through means within the agency's discretion and not otherwise appealable to the Board, including reassignment, is not appealable to the Board as a reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Caddell v. Department of Justice</span>, 52 MSPR 529, 532 (1992); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Defense</span>, 46 MSPR 154, 159 (1990); <span class="Italic">Lake v.

US Postal Service</span>, 19 MSPR 124, 126 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, moreover, that to treat availability pay as basic pay would render unnecessary the special statutory provision, 5 USC 5545a(e)(2), permitting the appeal of a denial of a certification of availability pay. The Board has jurisdiction over a reduction in basic pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(a)(4), 7512(4). Thus, if the pay increase granted under the LEAPA were basic pay, any reduction would be appealable to the Board without the additional statutory appeal right. No statutory provision should be read in a manner that would make it superfluous. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sutherland, Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 46.06 (5th ed.). Thus, 5 USC 5545a(e)(2) must be read as providing an appeal right which is not otherwise available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The LEAPA provides that each criminal investigator receiving availability pay and his appropriate supervisory officer shall make an annual certification to the head of the agency that the investigator has met and is expected to meet the requirement of an annual average of 2 unscheduled duty hours per day. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5545a(e)(1). The statute further provides that an involuntary reduction in pay resulting from a denial of certification shall be a reduction in pay for purposes of 5 USC 7512(4). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5545a(e)(2). A reduction in pay under 5 USC 7512(4) is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general rule applied to statutes granting powers to administrative agencies is that powers must be conferred either expressly or by necessary implication. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sutherland, Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 65.02 (5th ed.). The LEAPA expressly affords the Board jurisdiction over the employing agency's denial of annual certification<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 5545a(e)(2). In the LEAPA's legislative history regarding the certification process, Congress stated that, in the event premium pay is removed, agents classified by OPM as 1811-series criminal investigators are provided recourse and appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 286 at 100. Thus, Congress was specifically concerned with the continuation of the premium pay for criminal investigators; there is no implication that the appeal right was to encompass continuation of such pay for those who, for whatever reason, were not being retained as criminal investigators.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, based on the statutory language and the cited legislative history, we find that only those who continue to be 1811-series criminal investigators and lose availability pay by specific denial of certification are afforded the statutory right of appeal. If an employee is no longer subject to the annual certification process because he has been reassigned out of an 1811-series position, his loss of premium pay is not appealable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martinez</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Martinez v. MSPB</span>, 126 F.3d 1480, 1482-83 (Fed. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7512(4), the Board is given jurisdiction over an appeal of an involuntary reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Gulden v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 228 Ct. Cl. 879, 881 (1981). An "employee," as defined in 5 USC 7511(a)(1), may appeal a "reduction in pay" to the Board pursuant to section 7512(4). However, for purposes of such an appeal, "pay" is defined in section 7511(a)(4) as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." Since availability pay is premium pay, it is not part of the "rate of basic pay" for a criminal investigator. <span class="Italic">See Triponi v. United States</span>, 224 Ct. Cl. 503, 633 F.2d 933, 935-36 (1980) (distinguishing basic pay from premium pay). Accordingly, the reduction in Martinez's total pay as a result of his reassignment and the consequent loss of availability pay does not fall within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Martinez argues, however, that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 5 USC 5545a(e)(2). That section provides that an "[i]nvoluntary reduction in pay resulting from a denial of certification...shall be a reduction in pay for purposes of section 7512(4)." 5 USC 5545(e)(2) (1994). Martinez contends that Customs may cancel a criminal investigator's certification for availability pay for reasons other than a failure to meet the availability pay requirement of being available for the prescribed number of unscheduled duty hours. Martinez maintains that the provisions of LEAPA and one of its implementing regulations, found at 5 CFR 550.184(d), pertaining to certification for criminal investigators, do not preclude the cancellation of certification based upon the grounds which resulted in his reassignment. In other words, Martinez contends that his involuntary reassignment resulted in a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> cancellation of his availability pay certification, thereby giving the Board jurisdiction under section 5545a(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. First of all, we decline to read LEAPA as in any way providing that a reassignment out of a criminal investigator position constitutes a denial or cancellation of certification. There is simply nothing in the language of the statutory provisions that supports such a reading. As far as 5 CFR 550.184(d) is concerned, it states in part that "[t]he employing agency may deny or cancel a certification based on a finding that an investigator has failed to perform unscheduled duty (availability or work) as assigned or reported, or is unable to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period due to physical or health reasons." Like the statute, the regulation says nothing about the cancellation of availability pay as a result of an employee's reassignment to a position not eligible for the pay. The denial or cancellation of the availability pay certification contemplated by the regulation applies to those continuing in criminal investigator positions. Upon reassignment to the position of a physical security specialist, Martinez was no longer eligible for certification to receive availability pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The language of 5 CFR 550.184(c) indicates that the certification process is not relevant when an employee is no longer employed as a criminal investigator. There is no qualification with respect to the circumstances under which someone ceases to be a criminal investigator....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the LEAPA, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5545a, "criminal investigators are authorized availability pay, a premium pay equal to '25% of the rate of basic pay for the [criminal investigator] position,' to ensure their availability for unscheduled duty in excess of a 40-hour work week based on the needs of the employing agency." <span class="Italic">Martinez v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 71 MSPR 262, 264 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 126 F.3d 1480 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>

Further, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2), an "[i]nvoluntary reduction in pay resulting from a denial of certification [for availability pay under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(1)] shall be a reduction in pay for purposes of [5 USC] &#x00A7; 7512(4)[.] " An employee who has been subjected to a reduction in pay under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(4), is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(d), 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the Board has held that the LEAPA expressly affords the Board jurisdiction over the employing agency's denial of annual certification, that only criminal investigators in the GS-1811 series who lose availability pay by specific denial of certification are entitled by the statute to appeal to the Board, and that the Office of Personnel Management's implementing regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.184(d)-(e) are in accord with this interpretation. Martinez, 71 MSPR at 265-67. Thus, in the present case, the Board has jurisdiction over the appellants' appeals only if the agency specifically denied them certification. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants argued below, however, that <span class="Italic">Martinez</span> is distinguishable from their case because the Board found in Martinez that, inasmuch as the appellant was reassigned from his Criminal Investigator position, the Board lacked jurisdiction over his status as a non-Criminal Investigator and, therefore, he was not entitled to availability pay. We find this distinction unpersuasive because the focus here, as in Martinez, is whether there was a specific denial of certification for availability pay by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 71 MSPR at 265-67. Here, as in Martinez, the agency issued no specific denial of certification of availability pay for the appellants. Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over these appeals. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 71 MSPR at 265-67.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note the agency's contention that it issued no denial of certification because the appellants' positions are not LEO positions. As employees covered by FERS, the appellants must meet the definition of LEO under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8401(17) to be eligible for certification of availability pay. The appellants may request LEO status determination under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.804(c) and appeal a denial of LEO status under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 842.807(a); <span class="Italic">see also Streeter v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because no LEO status determination was made in this appeal, the administrative judge erred by considering the merits of the appellants' LEO status. Nevertheless, because the agency never issued a specific denial of certification for availability pay for the appellants, we find that the administrative judge's error in determining the appellants' LEO status did not prejudice the parties' substantive rights because he correctly concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction over these appeals. <span class="Italic">See Martinez</span>, 71 MSPR at 265-67.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Law enforcement officers receive additional pay and may retire earlier than other government employees. <span class="Italic">See Bingaman v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431, 1433-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Both the governing statute and the applicable regulations provide explicit standards for determining law enforcement officer (LEO) status. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1434.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994 Congress enacted the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act of 1994 ("1994 Act"), Pub. L. No. 103-329, &#x00A7; 633, 108 Stat. 2425 (1994) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a (1998)), "to provide premium pay to criminal investigators to ensure the availability of criminal investigators for unscheduled duty in excess of a 40 hour week based on the needs of the employing agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(b). Shortly thereafter, the Department informed its employees that criminal investigators in Caven's classification were not entitled to "availability pay" because they did not meet the eligibility criteria for law enforcement officer status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caven nevertheless applied to the Department for law enforcement officer status. The Department denied his request, but on appeal the Board held that he was entitled to such status and ordered the Department to grant him "law enforcement officer retirement coverage." On the basis of that decision, Caven then requested the Department to reconsider the question of availability pay and grant it to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After some delay in replying, the Department in June 2002 denied Caven availability pay because he did not meet two of the statutory requirements for such pay: (1) working a minimum number of hours of unscheduled overtime and (2) certification by a superior that he had met the requirements for such pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caven appealed to the Board the Department's failure to give him retroactive availability pay, which he sought for the period between the effective date of the 1994 Act in that year and 2002, when he ceased to serve as a criminal investigator. The Board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Caven v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, No. SE-0752-02-0194-I-1 (M.S.P.B.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board stated in this case, "Congress has clearly granted to the Board jurisdiction to review agency denials of requests for LEO retirement credit.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), and 8461(e)(1) (West 1996)." <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 5;<span class="Italic"> see Elias v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 114 F.3d 1164, 1166-67 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (agency decision concerning law enforcement officer service credit is appealable and is within the Board's jurisdiction). In reviewing denials of certification for availability pay, however, the Board's jurisdiction is far more limited. As the Board correctly indicated, it has such jurisdiction only if the denial of certification results in a "reduction in the [employee's] pay, or the suspension of his availability pay." <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the 1994 Act, a "criminal investigator" defined as a "law enforcement officer" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(a)(2) is entitled to availability pay if the unscheduled overtime he works or is available to work equals or exceeds specified amounts. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(d). Subsection (e)(1) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Each criminal investigator receiving availability pay under this section and the appropriate supervisory officer, to be designated by the head of the agency, shall make an annual certification to the head of the agency that the investigator has met, and is expected to meet, the requirements of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(1). Subsection (e)(2) then provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Involuntary reduction in pay resulting from a denial of certification under paragraph (1) shall be a reduction in pay for purposes of section 7512(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2). Section 7512(4), read in conjunction with section 7513(d), gives the Board jurisdiction over appeals by any employee who has been subjected to "a reduction in pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criminal investigator's certification to which section 5545a(e)(1) refers is that of an investigator "receiving availability pay." An "[i]nvoluntary reduction in pay" that triggers Board jurisdiction is one "resulting from a denial of [such] certification." &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2). In other words, the Board's jurisdiction over denial of availability pay is limited to cases in which the certification terminates such pay that a criminal investigator was receiving. It does not extend to denials of certification that prospectively deny employees availability pay that they have not been receiving, but to which they claim entitlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these provisions, the Board correctly held that it had no jurisdiction in Caven's case. Since Caven never had received availability pay, the Department's denial of certification for such pay was not a "reduction in pay." It was a refusal to increase pay, not a reduction of it--a quite different concept.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caven contends, however, that his pay was in effect constructively reduced when the Department refused to increase it by denying him availability pay. He argues that because the Board held that he was entitled to retroactive law enforcement officer status, if he had been given such status in 1994 (as he asserts he should have been), he would necessarily also have been given availability pay from that time; therefore, his pay was reduced when the Department refused to certify him for availability pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The argument rests on a fallacious assumption: that law enforcement officers automatically are entitled to assistance pay. The latter pay is not automatic, however, but requires compliance with the requirements of section 5545a, which include certification by both the law enforcement officer and his superior that the officer has met the statutory requirements. Moreover, a law enforcement officer may be denied availability pay for reasons other than a lack of certification. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 126 F.3d 1480, 1482 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (loss of availability pay due to reassignment to non-criminal investigator position was not the result of a denial of certification and therefore was not appealable to the Board under &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the argument is contrary to the well-settled principle that the denial of a promotion that would have provided additional pay is not an appealable reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Donovan v. United States</span>, 580 F.2d 1203, 1207-08 (3d Cir. 1978) (wrongful delay in promotion raised claim that plaintiff should have been paid at a higher rate, and was not a reduction in pay remediable under the Back Pay Act); <span class="Italic">see also Chaney v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 906 F.2d 697, 698 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (a reduction in pay occurs only when there is an ascertainable lowering of the employee's pay at the time of the action). Moreover, "a denial of premium pay does not constitute a reduction in pay that is appealable to the Board." <span class="Italic">Nigg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 321 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Mattern v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 291 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2002)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Caven's argument is similar to one the Supreme Court rejected in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976). There, government employees who contended that they should have been classified at a higher grade sued in the Court of Claims to recover, through retroactive reclassification of their positions, the difference in pay between the grade they held and the higher grade. In holding that the Court of Claims had no jurisdiction over the suit, the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There is no claim here that either respondent has been denied the benefit of the position to which he was appointed. The claim, instead, is that each has been denied the benefit of a position to which he should have been, but was not, appointed. The established rule is that one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been duly appointed to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 402.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, here, Caven seeks "availability pay" that he had not received but that he contends he should have been given, and the Board lacks jurisdiction over his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited to actions made appealable to the Board by a law, rule or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a); <span class="Italic">see Minor v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 819 F.2d 280, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Here, Congress has limited the Board's jurisdiction over appeals relating to denials of assistance pay to cases of denial of certification for such pay for employees who had previously been receiving it. Caven does not fall within that class, and the Board therefore correctly held that it had no jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Denial of LEAPA certification for reasons other than those specified in OPM regulations constituted an appealable reduction in pay, and that reduction was reversed, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, 117 MSPR 628, 630-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12, 2012 MSPB 24 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an August 19, 2010 memorandum, the Director of Emergency Services proposed to terminate the Law Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP) of appellant Smith, a Game Warden, GS-1812-09, and appellant Walker, a Supervisory Criminal Investigator, GS-1811-12, based on the determination that there would not be a sufficient amount of work to justify certifying their continued LEAP. Each appellant was afforded an opportunity to reply to the proposal, and each did so. On October 1, 2010, the Garrison Commander issued each appellant a decision stating that his LEAP for the upcoming year would be terminated, and it was terminated, effective October 3, 2010. Under the Law Enforcement Availability Pay Act of 1994 (LEAPA), codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a, criminal investigators are authorized availability pay, a premium pay equal to 25% of the rate of basic pay for the position, to ensure their availability for unscheduled duty in excess of a 40-hour work week based on the needs of the employing agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(b). The agency explained to these appellants that it had determined that there was not a sufficient amount of work to justify certifying that they currently met and were expected to continue to meet the substantial excess hours requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.183 during the upcoming 1-year period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each appellant challenged the action, arguing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that his work situation and its demands were unchanged from the previous year. Each requested a hearing. In the absence of an objection by any of the parties, <span id="Page_352"></span>the administrative judge consolidated the appeals and scheduled a hearing. At the prehearing conference, he advised the parties of his view that there was a question as to the validity of the agency's decision to terminate the appellants' LEAP for the reason it provided since, under the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) regulations, the agency could only deny certification on certain distinct grounds, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d), (c), and the reason proffered by the agency was not one of them. Nonetheless, acknowledging that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2), the involuntary termination of LEAP is considered a reduction in pay for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4), the administrative judge set out the agency's burden of proof in such cases<span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the scheduled hearing date, the administrative judge notified the parties that he had determined that the appellants were entitled to prevail in their appeals as a matter of law, whereupon they withdrew their hearing request. The administrative judge found that, under OPM's regulations, an agency may only deny or cancel a certification of the type the agency had previously given to the appellants in their current positions under specific circumstances, C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d), 182(e), but that nothing in OPM's regulations interpreting LEAPA authorizes an agency to deny certification based on its determination that its workload does not justify the need for the hours of unscheduled duty required for a criminal investigator to qualify for LEAP. On the contrary, the administrative judge found that, apart from the specific circumstances noted, OPM's regulations state that each agency shall ensure that each criminal investigator's hours of unscheduled duty are sufficient to enable the investigator to meet the substantial hours requirement and to enable him to make the required annual certification. The administrative judge examined the legislative history of LEAPA and the Federal Register notice through which OPM issued the implementing interim regulations and found that they supported the conclusion that the statute should be interpreted as providing criminal investigators a guaranteed source of income, rather than one that is uncertain and dependent on a yearly discretionary judgment by the agency concerning the extent to which its criminal workload in an upcoming year might require a certain amount of unscheduled duty on their part. The administrative judge concluded that the agency had not established that its decisions to deny certification in these appeals were based on a valid reason and that therefore it had failed to support its decisions by preponderant evidence. Accordingly, he reversed the actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">LEAPA, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a, requires that each criminal investigator receiving availability pay and the appropriate supervisory officer make an annual certification that the investigator has met, and is expected to meet, the requirement that the annual average of unscheduled duty hours worked is in excess of each regular work day by at least 2 hours per day. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(1), (d)(1).[2] In defining when certification is appropriate, Congress implicitly prescribed the circumstances when certification should be denied as being when the investigator has not met, nor is expected to meet, the statutory threshold of unscheduled duty hours entitling him or her to availability pay. As born out by this case, these tacit parameters for denying certification are unquestionably ambiguous. On the one hand, they could be read as focusing on the investigator's demonstrated and expected ability and willingness to perform unscheduled duty hours. Or, they could be interpreted as requiring consideration of the agency's past and projected workload. In any event, the Board need not reconcile this ambiguity in the first instance because OPM already has.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As noted, the statute provides that an involuntary reduction in pay resulting from a denial of certification shall be a reduction in pay for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(4). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5548(a), Congress authorized OPM to prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of Subchapter V, Premium Pay, which encompasses &#x00A7; 5545a. Pursuant to that statutory authority, OPM has promulgated regulations governing the administration of law enforcement availability pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.181-187. In those regulations, OPM set forth two specific circumstances under which an agency may deny certification: (1) when an investigator has failed to perform unscheduled duty as assigned or reported, or (2) when he is unable to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period due to physical or health reasons.[3] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d). The regulations also require that an employing agency ensure that each investigator's hours are sufficient to meet the threshold number of unscheduled duty hours required to earn availability pay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.182(e). The agency challenges OPM's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e) insofar as it precludes consideration of the agency's projected workforce needs in determining whether certification for availability pay is warranted under that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The regulations also provide that a certification "shall no longer apply" when the employee separates from federal service, is employed by another agency, moves to a position that does not qualify as a criminal investigator position, or begins an opt-out period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(c), 182(f). These circumstances are distinguishable as they are based on voluntary action by the investigator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To address the agency's challenge to OPM's interpretation of this portion of the statute, the Board engages in the two-step analytic process articulated in <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

We first determine whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue, <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842, examining the statute's text, structure, and legislative history, and apply the relevant canons of interpretation. <span class="Italic">Delverde, SrL v.

If, however, we conclude that Congress had no intent on the matter, or that Congress's purpose and intent is unclear, the determination to be made is whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statutory language at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">see also Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843. As to the latter step, we need not find that the agency's construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The question at issue in this case is whether, under LEAPA, an agency can terminate an employee's certification, and thereby reduce his pay, based on its determination that there does not appear to be a sufficient amount of work to justify certifying that he currently meets and is expected to continue to meet the substantial hours requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.183 during the upcoming 1-year period. As noted, the statute on its face is undeniably ambiguous as to the circumstances under which an agency may deny certification and thereby terminate an employee's LEAP. However, the statute's legislative history provides some insight into Congress's intention. The Senate Committee on Appropriations explained the basis for providing recourse and appeal rights to employees whose agencies terminate their LEAP, recognizing "the right of agencies to ensure that agents are complying with the duties required to receive compensation and [that] agencies have the prerogative to remove the availability pay compensation if an agent undertakes such actions, so as to avoid work or availability." S. Rep. No. 103-286 at 100 (1994). Although it did not directly address the issue of an agency's terminating an employee's LEAP, a House Conference Report emphasized that, unlike "Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime," which it replaced, LEAP is a guaranteed, uniformly applied form of compensation. H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-729 at 56 (1994). Moreover, the author of the legislation, former Senator Dennis DeConcini, the then-Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, provided a statement that appeared in the Congressional Record on November 30, 1994, "to express in clear terms the intent of the LEAP legislation." <span class="Italic">See Buckley v. United States</span>, 57 Fed. Cl. 328, 348 (2003) (while statements by individual legislators should not be given controlling weight, they may evidence Congressional intent when consistent with statutory language and other pieces of legislative history). On the issue of the termination of LEAP, Senator DeConcini explained that it was not the intent of Congress to provide to management the right to arbitrarily remove the compensation from an employee, that termination should result from an investigator's refusal or unwillingness to work unscheduled duty, poor performance and low productivity together with a deficiency in unscheduled duty hours, that common sense should apply, and that managers should be well aware of the performance, attitude and efforts of their personnel and not base a denied certification solely on the accrual of hours. 140 Cong. Rec. S15266-01 (daily ed. Nov. 30, 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This legislative history supports a finding that Congress intended that LEAP would be the basis for providing guaranteed compensation to covered employees and that agencies would be able to involuntarily terminate employees' entitlement to LEAP only for inability or unwillingness to perform the unscheduled duty that is a fundamental part of a position that is subject to LEAP. We therefore give effect to that intention and find, by its promulgation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d), that OPM acted in accordance with that intention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to find that Congress had no intent on this matter, however, or that its purpose and intent is unclear, we would find that OPM's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute and afford <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to it. <span class="Italic">Delverde</span>, 202 F.3d at 1363; <span class="Italic">see also Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843. In the Federal Register notice accompanying its issuance of the interim LEAP regulations, OPM referred to the possibility of an agency's not providing availability pay to otherwise qualified criminal investigators as occurring "under several narrow exceptions." 59 <span id="Page_353"></span>Fed. Reg. 66,150 (Dec. 23, 1994). OPM indicated that the provision that an agency may suspend payment of availability pay when it determines that an investigator has not been performing the required amount of unscheduled duty as assigned or reported reflects the intent of Congress that agencies would have the prerogative to remove availability pay if an investigator avoids work or availability, and that, in addition, availability pay may be suspended if an investigator is in a duty status but unable to perform unscheduled duty for an extended period due to physical or health limitations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We would therefore afford <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to OPM's interpretation of the statute and find it reasonable that an agency can only terminate an employee's LEAP for the reasons provided at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.184(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency did not terminate the appellants' LEAP for an authorized reason under OPM's regulations, we further find that it failed to support its decision by preponderant evidence, and that these actions must be reversed.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The statute specifically entrusts heads of law enforcement agencies with the authority to prescribe regulations necessary to administer the certification process. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(e)(1). We note this not to suggest that OPM's certification regulation is unauthorized, which is doubtful given that agency's general authority to regulate premium pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5548, but rather to respond to the agency's argument in these appeals that it should not have to pay employees availability pay when the workload does not warrant it. There is no indication here that the agency head has exercised the statutory authority to issue regulations administering the agency's certification process. Consequently, even if we agreed that it would be a waste of taxpayer money to pay a premium for nonexistent work, in the absence of an agency-specific regulation governing its certification procedure, we are required to give effect to OPM's regulations which do not contemplate consideration of the agency's projected workloads as grounds for denial or cancellation of certification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For VA employees, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017, 38 USC 721, provides for the VA to require an employee to repay all or some of a bonus or award to the employee if it is determined that the award or bonus would not have been paid had the employee's poor performance or misconduct been known prior to payment. The statute provides for notice and reply and the opportunity to appeal an adverse order to the Director of OPM.</p>
