<h3 class="h3" id="sec16-3"><span class="space">A.</span> SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES; ELEMENTS OF SETTLEMENTS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">"In Board actions, as in civil actions, public policy favors resolution by settlement," <span class="Italic">Huberdeau v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 83 MSPR 591, 592 (1999), provided the settlement agreements are consistent with law, equity, and public policy, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 379, 381 (1992), and a party challenging a settlement agreement must prove that it "was procured by fraud practiced upon that party or by mutual mistake under which both parties acted," <span class="Italic">Burns v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 79, 81 (1991). To promote effective settlements, before dismissing an appeal as settled, an AJ must document for the record whether the parties reached an agreement, whether they understood its terms, and whether the agreement was enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 48 MSPR 330, 332 (1991). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Doyle</span>, 45 MSPR 43, 49 (1990) (Hatch Act case: "Although the Special Counsel has broad authority to enter into settlement agreements, the Board may not approve such agreements where statutory constraints exist.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement represents a resolution in the interests of the parties, and it eliminates the cost and uncertainty associated with further protracted litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Anyel</span>, 66 MSPR 328, 331 (1995). "Settlement agreements in no way imply that the underlying personnel actions were unwarranted or unjustified." <span class="Italic">McDavid v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 673, 675 (1993). [For a discussion of settlement techniques see Tuck's <span class="Italic">Crafting Durable Settlement Agreements</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/12CDSA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2012), John Settle's <span class="Italic">The Advocate's Practical Guide to Using Mediation</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/05APGM.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2005), and Broida's <span class="Italic">Settlement Forms for MSPB and EEOC Personnel Litigation</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/21SFME.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2021).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ properly encourages the parties to try to settle cases, since public policy favors settlement agreements in civil actions to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues. <span class="Italic">Reape v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 406, 409-10 (1989); <span class="Italic">Martin v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 326, 329 (1987). No harm is done if the AJ conducts an informal settlement conference at the end of a hearing. <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 274, 276 (1985). [Refer to bias allegations in Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-165.html#sec3-165">Remarks About Counsel, Party, Merits, Settlement; Remarks During Hearing <span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span> Communication</a>" and refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-045.html#sec16-46">Coercion or Bias by Judge</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Withdrawal of the appeal may be the only consideration necessary to support the obligations incurred by an agency through settlement, <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 383, 388-89 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Forbearance to make use of a legal remedy, such as continuing the appeal in this case, is "sufficient consideration" for a return promise. 1 <span class="Italic">Corbin On Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 139 (6th Reprint 1991)<span class="Italic">. See also ITT Gilfillan, Inc. v. United States</span>, 471 F.2d 1382, 1385-86 (Ct. Cl. 1973); <span class="Italic">Penn-Ohio Steel Corporation v. United States</span>, 354 F.2d 254, 268 (Ct. Cl. 1965). Even if the underlying claim is "wholly ill-founded," the forbearance to press it can be sufficient consideration for the promise of the other party as long as the claim was made in good faith<span class="Italic">. Corbin</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00A7; 140. We find, therefore, that the appellant's agreement to settle his appeal rather than pursue further legal remedies was adequate consideration for the agency's promise to waive its right to raise the timeliness issue and to pay the appellant back pay for both periods and appellant's counsel reasonable attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The settlement process at the level of the regional or field office was briefly described in the 1995 internal MSPB report <span class="Italic">Resolving MSPB Cases: An Examination of the Board's Settlement Program</span>, at 3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement process begins as soon as a case is filed. In the signed order acknowledging receipt of the appeal, the AJ instructs the parties to begin settlement discussions, and parties often settle appeals at that point with almost no input from the AJ. Thereafter, AJs continually encourage the parties to consider settlements at every stage of the appeals process. Once the case file is received from the agency, AJs usually call the parties to discuss the status of the appeal. During that conversation, the AJ asks the parties to report on the progress of their settlement discussions. The AJs also explain that they will be available to help the parties at any point in their settlement efforts. Later, at the prehearing conference, AJs will again ask about settlement; and they continue to seek settlement immediately prior to, during, and even after the hearing takes place.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The settlement process is also described in a publication written by several MSPB AJs, <span class="Italic">A Settlement Guide for Administrative Judges</span>, <span class="Italic">circa</span> 1989--dated but useful, available from the Board through a FOIA request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement should conclude the Board litigation. Because the settlement agreement resolves the basic action underlying the appeal, the parties cannot subsequently relitigate the merits before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burkley v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3243) ("[T]he settlement agreement resolved any controversy surrounding Burkley's original discharge. 'There is therefore no case or controversy touching the discharge and over the merits of which either [the Board] or this court might exercise jurisdiction.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982)); <span class="Italic">Black v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 279, 280 (1994) ("Because the settlement agreement resolved the basic controversy surrounding the appellant's restoration to duty claim, the parties cannot relitigate the merits of that action."). Most settlements are reached before issuance of an initial decision. Settlements may result from circumstances external to the Board's procedures, but they will be accepted by the Board, if its criteria are met, during the pendency of an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wacasey v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 9, 10 (1985) (withdrawal of appeal as the result of an order entered by a state criminal court); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 11, 11 (1985) (settlement resulting from "separate action").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement is valid if it is filed with the AJ after issuance of an initial decision but before that decision becomes final. <span class="Italic">Goulet v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 61 MSPR 336, 338 (1994). In 1994, the Board amended its regulations so that if the settlement is accepted during that time period, the AJ then vacates the original initial decision and, presumably, issues another initial decision dismissing the case as settled with notice of review rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.112(a)(4) (2022). If, after an initial decision becomes final, the AJ receives a settlement that the parties desire to be incorporated into the record for enforcement purposes, the AJ would likely forward it to the central office of the Board and leave it to that organization to determine whether to treat the settlement as a request to reopen the appeal or whether some other course should be followed. [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-101.html#sec3-101">Regional Authority After Initial Decision</a>," and in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-015.html#sec16-16_1">Settlement After Initial Decision</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through settlement, the parties may provide remedies broader than those that could be achieved through Board litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. DOJ</span>, 90 MSPR 690, 697 &#x00B6; 10 (2002). Public policy issues aside, the parties are the master <span id="Page_4744"></span>of their agreement: although an AJ should not accept an agreement with unlawful provisions into the record, the AJ is not otherwise authorized to decide what provisions of an agreement are entered into the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robertson v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 573, 578 (1989). It is desirable, but not required, that the parties state in the agreement whether it is to be made part of the record. <span class="Italic">Sitas v. VA</span>, 41 MSPR 214, 216 (1989). Nevertheless, under <span class="Italic">Sitas</span> it is required that the AJ ascertain through some means whether the parties wish to have the agreement entered into the record for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that a settlement agreement is submitted to and accepted into the record for enforcement by the AJ, the parties will receive a notice stating that the appeal is dismissed on the basis of the settlement and that the Board retains jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcement. The resolution of an appeal through a settlement that is accepted into the record constitutes a final Board decision, ending adjudication on the merits of the underlying appeal, leaving the Board with residual authority to authority to enforce the terms of the settlement. This also applies to verbal agreements reflected by the record and accepted by AJs. <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 495, 497 (1985). Enforcement authority aside, however, the settlement through withdrawal of an appeal otherwise removes the appeal from MSPB jurisdiction, providing no residual jurisdiction to adjudicate an allegation of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 237 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a time, some AJs believed that their job was only to develop a record and issue an initial decision. If the parties wished to settle, that was fine, but it was not the AJ's concern, unless the settlement was presented to the AJ as an accomplished fact to terminate the litigation. No court could long survive with that attitude. It would be overwhelmed with litigation. Nor could the Board continue a policy that ignored settlement of personnel disputes. The Board eventually recognized that settlement beats adjudication. AJs are now encouraged to settle cases, and they routinely issue prehearing orders directing the parties to engage in settlement discussions. Often, initial bilateral settlement discussions are not productive because the parties are not realistic. Good AJs help the process along by informally mediating, or by explaining to and convincing the parties of the respective strong and weak points of each case, using their influence and knowledge to promote a settlement. AJs also have available for the parties a Board mediation program and a settlement judge program, subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How do AJs settle cases? Generally, in one way or another, they tell the parties (separately or together) what they think of their cases, and they may offer innovative suggestions for resolution. If an AJ tells an agency representative that the appellant has a very good case and it would be wise to settle, the agency representative has leverage in discouraging continuation of the litigation by agency management. If the AJ reports to an appellant's counsel that the agency case is strong, the appellant is more likely to start thinking about resignation with some collateral benefits through a settlement. In what context are settlement discussions conducted? The Board's FY89 Budget Justification reported:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judges have been able to utilize a wide variety of dispute resolution techniques. They facilitate an exchange between the parties, suggesting possible solutions and helping the parties reach a voluntary agreement. They make use of the prehearing conference stage of the appeals process to gain an ongoing involvement with the parties, thus facilitating settlement. They also may conduct a mini-trial where participants present a condensed version of their best arguments and then discuss settlement. Since these processes are voluntary, the parties surrender no rights if an agreement is not reached, and the case can then proceed to adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement efforts by AJs may be incorporated into their case management orders. An example taken from one "Order Granting Motion to Suspend" is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties are encouraged to try to resolve this matter informally during the suspension period. They must discuss settlement at least twice during the suspension period. The agency's representative is directed to contact the appellant representative to arrange for these two discussions. Both parties are expected to cooperate in arriving at a mutual feasible date and time for these discussions. If the parties do not resolve the appeal during the suspension period, they should contact the Board. If they do not resolve the appeal during that time, I will inquire as to what <span class="Italic">specific</span> these discussions they have had concerning settlement at the next conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although Board settlement statistics increase over time, they do not equal the percentage of cases settled in our courts. The Board affirms a very high percentage of agency actions; some managers, and some agency counsel, feel that because they are quite likely to win their cases, there is no reason to settle. Another impediment to settlement is that some managers seem unconcerned about costs. The taxpayer, and not a concerned business owner or executive reporting to stockholders, foots the bill. Investors sue for damages caused by mismanagement, or toss out the managers; taxpayers do not. It makes a difference. Finally, government counsel or personnel specialists who handle Board cases often have no real conception of how to settle an appeal; sometimes they do not even know who in the agency has the authority to settle. Appellants may seek revenge or exoneration rather than recovery, making it difficult for their representatives to accomplish a settlement. In the personnel field, as in divorce litigation, more than money is involved: there are hurt feelings all over the battlefield. Personnel litigation is personal. Emotions on all sides cloud objective assessment of the merits of the case and impede reasoned consideration of settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given the impediments to settlement, it takes talented AJs to achieve settlements of adverse actions. Greater ingenuity is required following legislative and presidential efforts (through an executive order, later discussed) making clean paper settlements difficult for a few years. Settlement requires creativity and salesmanship by the adjudicator, not a letter or telephone call telling the parties that they are encouraged to settle the case. Under proper controls, it advances the interests of the parties and reduces Board litigation if AJs are more active and more skilled in settlement negotiations. Managing settlement effectively involves more than offer trading. Greater involvement of AJs in the settlement process is encouraged, at least formally, by the regulatory provision allowing the parties to waive the prohibition against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. The parties may agree that the AJ will act as a mediator, listening off the record to statements or reviewing evidence from one side and then the other, conditioning the mediation role on the understanding that if the appeal cannot settle through mediation or a process like it, the parties will then go through the hearing process on the record, offering all their evidence in accordance with Board rules, as though the mediation process never occurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an adjudicator listens to positions and nonrecord evidence advanced during settlement and suggests solutions that may reflect the adjudicator's position on the case, and if the case is then not settled, it can be difficult for the parties to trust the adjudicator's ability to review the case on the record with an open mind. It might be difficult to believe the adjudicator can sort out what he heard during settlement discussions from what was heard during the hearing or gleaned from the exhibits, but they do. <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 259 (1988), suggested:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board is not reluctant to allow its administrative judges to participate in settlement discussions with the parties; such participation is permissible, and in fact is encouraged, but <span class="Italic">only</span> if both parties agree to it. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(a)(5). Either party--or the administrative judge--may request that a different administrative judge be assigned to conduct the hearing if settlement is not reached and he or she feels that the administrative judge will not be able to render an impartial decision. Where the parties agree to allow the administrative judge to participate in the settlement discussions, absent specific improper actions by the administrative judge, a party cannot later assert that the administrative judge's involvement in the settlement process was unwarranted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 373, 377 (1990) (rejecting the appellant's allegation of error by the AJ, who participated in settlement discussions despite the appellant's objection: "The appellant could have requested that a different administrative judge be assigned to conduct the hearing if the appellant and his representative felt that the administrative judge would not be able to render an impartial decision."). [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-165.html#sec3-165">Remarks About Counsel, Party, Merits, Settlement; Remarks During Hearing; <span class="Italic">Ex Parte</span> Communication</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Errors asserted in the mediation program are inconsequential to the outcome of an appeal should the mediation fail, unless there is an affirmative showing that mediation changed the outcome. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pearson v. VA,</span> CH-1221-09-0692-W-1 (NP 2/2/2011) ("Whether or not the Board's mediator for the first attempt was 'abusive,' as the appellant alleges, cannot be determined from the record. When mediation failed, however, the appeal was re-docketed and continued through regional office processing. The appellant cannot show that failed mediation in any way changed the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">See Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 124, 127 (1981).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With or without the active participation of AJs or other intermediaries, appeals are settled, often through no more than the discussions between counsel to the parties or, for <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, through discussions between an agency representative and the appellant. If a settlement is reached, it should be documented and complete. Preliminary negotiations do not count. "Absent a formal withdrawal of an appeal, and until the parties have agreed on the specific terms of the settlement agreement, the act of finality constituting a settlement has not occurred." <span class="Italic">Lee v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 236, 238 &#x00B6; 3 (1999). What is important is the "act of finality"--that is, the agreement of the parties that results from the negotiations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stone v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 34, 37 (1990). Once agreement is reached, the agreement should then be filed with the AJ, who should be requested to accept the agreement and enter it in the record. If the parties want the settlement protected from public scrutiny, a motion can be made to seal the record of the settlement. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-08-031.html#sec1-32">Sealing of Record or Files</a>," discussed in Chapter 1.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties desire that the Board retain enforcement authority over a settlement, the settlement should be submitted for acceptance into the record, no matter what precautions are needed to ensure its confidentiality. Guidance from Board Headquarters to the Regions of June 29, 1983, states that when a case is settled, the decision closing out the case should specify whether the settlement agreement was reviewed and made a part of the record or only cited as the basis for a withdrawal. Settlements entered into the <span id="Page_4745"></span>record and approved for enforcement are subject to compliance procedures. If a settlement finds its way into the record only as evidence of Board jurisdiction over an action, the settlement is not enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Good v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 108, 111 (1991) (settlement from EEO case bearing on the appellant's probationary status). Settlements resolving disputes over compliance with Board orders are enforceable. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Mandujano v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-18-0083-X-1 (NP 9/27/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a good reason for having the Board dismiss an appeal only on the condition that it receive, accept, and enter the settlement agreement into the record of the appeal: unless the agreement becomes part of the appeal record, the Board will not enforce it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sitas v. VA</span>, 41 MSPR 214, 216 (1989). The Board does not approve a settlement; rather, it accepts the settlement into the record if the settlement meets the various criteria discussed in this section. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. DHUD</span>, 47 MSPR 331, 332 n.1 (1991). Perhaps the distinction between approval and acceptance is meant to ensure that the parties understand that the Board does not provide a qualitative assessment of the merits of an agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On occasion an AJ or counsel for a party may have the idea that the settlement, if not accepted by the Board for enforcement, can be enforced somewhere else, e.g., in a federal court. The jurisdictional problems in third-party enforcement can be considerable, difficult and time-consuming to resolve. <span class="Italic">See, e.g,</span> <span class="Italic">Holmes v. United States</span>, 657 F.3d 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (lawsuit in the Federal Claims Court to enforce an EEO settlement reached in a federal district court). Appellants should ensure that settlements are accepted by the Board into its appellate record for enforcement purposes. [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-130.html#sec17-126">Tucker Act</a>" for decisions concerning the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims to entertain lawsuits based on breached settlements reached through EEO and MSPB processes.] Some guidance for addressing the jurisdictional problems is offered later in this Chapter. [Refer later to "<a href="0100-2023-23-016.html#sec16-17">Jurisdiction to Accept Settlement: <span class="Italic">Delorme</span></a><span class="Italic">."]</span> On occasion, there may be an alternate means of enforcement available, for example, if the settlement also resolves EEO claims and then falls within the enforcement authority of EEOC under 29 CFR 1614.504 (2022). [For discussion of EEOC enforcement authority, refer to Davis and Hadley's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Federal Sector Equal Employment Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/21SFME.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Appellants and agencies are urged, first, to make their agreements comprehensive; second, to reduce their agreements to writing; and third, to terminate Board litigation through motion for dismissal of the appeal only on the condition that the agreement be received, accepted, and entered into the Board's appeal record for purposes of enforcement. Although either party may file an agreement with the Board under <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 547, 550 (1990), it appears, under <span class="Italic">Burton v. DHHS</span>, 45 MSPR 37, 40 n.6 (1990), that enforceability of an agreement by filing the agreement with the Board ought to be a mutual decision of the parties. Under <span class="Italic">Burton</span>, "[a]greement on enforceability is unnecessary where one party makes clear that he does not desire to have an agreement entered into the record for enforcement purposes." Counsel and parties should provide a provision in their settlement agreement specifically stating that the agreement will be filed with the Board for purposes of enforcement, and conditioning the settlement upon the Board's acceptance for that purpose, if that is their intent.</p>
