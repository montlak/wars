<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-651"><span class="space">E.</span> STUDIES, OBSERVATIONS, AND SAMPLING</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's rulings concerning the use of studies and sampling techniques in performance appraisal and establishment of performance standards fluctuate. A proposal that there be no secret studies and that studies be conducted on typical workers under normal working conditions was a negotiable procedure for management to use in the development of performance standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen. Comm. of AFGE for SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 332 (1986) (Proposal 3). A negotiable provision required management to inform the union of studies concerning performance appraisals, to avoid secret studies. The proposal was consistent with the portion of &#x00A7; 7114 prohibiting the agency from furnishing to the union data constituting guidance or advice to management concerning collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3483 and Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd., New York Dist. Office</span>, 13 FLRA 446, 450 (1983) (Proposal 3). A proposal was negotiable inviting agreement that there be no secret studies bearing on performance appraisals and that all studies by the employer be conducted on typical <span id="page_1093"></span>workdays under normal working conditions. The proposal was of a procedural nature concerning the development of an appraisal system. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3804 and FDIC, Chicago Region</span>, 7 FLRA 217, 227-28 (1981) (Proposal 4). Negotiable was a proposal that the union participate in studies conducted on employees and in development of the performance system. Nothing in the proposal required that the union negotiate over the content of standards or participate in internal management deliberations. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1808 and Dept. of Army, Sierra Army Depot</span>, 30 FLRA 1236, 1251 (1988) (Provision 9). [Refer to proposals concerning studies later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-655.html#sec6-656">Performance Measurement; Statistical Applications; Forced Distributions</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">But a proposal was nonnegotiable that "[a]ll monitoring or observation of the work performance of an employee shall be conducted openly and with full knowledge of the unit employees," and that "[u]nit employees evaluations shall be prepared only on the basis of information directly observed by Employer officials," <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 28 FLRA 871, 875, 877-78 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[P]roposals which prohibit an agency from using information gathered by means of a particular evaluation method or techniques, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1454 and Veterans Administration</span>, 26 FLRA No. 99 (1987) (Proposals 2-6); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Northeastern Program Service Center and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 1760</span>, 18 FLRA 437 (1985) (Proposals 1, 2, 5, and 7) or which limit management's ability to collect data for purposes of performance evaluation, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 1760 and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 15 FLRA 905 (1984) (measuring productivity Proposal 1), directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second disputed sentence effectively prohibits management from using information gathered by means of monitoring or observation for purposes of performance evaluation when the monitoring or observation is not conducted openly and with the full knowledge of the employee.&#x2003;The third disputed sentence limits the information which management may use in evaluating employees to that information directly observed by management officials. Contrary to the argument of the Union, these provisions are not similar to proposals which were limited to prohibiting secret studies bearing on performance standards. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 1708 and Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point, Southport, North Carolina</span>, 15 FLRA 3 (1984) (Proposal 1), and <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO Local 3804 and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chicago Region, Illinois</span>, 7 FLRA 217 (1981) (Proposal 4). Those proposals were concerned only with procedures to be observed in the development of performance standards and were negotiable under section 7106(b)(2). In contrast to the provisions in this case, they did not interfere with management's rights by prescribing the methods and means to be used or not used by management in evaluating employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">That result was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034-35 (D.C. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second disputed phrase concerns the methods the agency will use to monitor employees' work performance. The union's proposal would prevent any monitoring of employee performance by clandestine surveillance and limit the agency to use of direct observation by supervisors. The Authority found the proposal nonnegotiable because it would prohibit the agency from determining the most appropriate methods for evaluating employees, in violation of its rights to assign work and direct employees. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union and NTEU Chapter 91 and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Southwest Region,</span> 19 F.L.R.A. (No. 82) 647, 648 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union argues that the proposal is negotiable because it concerns the procedures by which management carries out its statutory rights.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b) (2). The proposal would effectively prevent management from using any information derived from clandestine surveillance. Despite being framed in procedural terms, this limitation on the techniques the agency may use to gather data necessary to evaluate employee performance directly interferes with management's right to make substantive employment decisions. As such, the proposal is not procedural and is outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 819 F.2d 306, 308 (D.C. Cir. 1987). The FLRA's finding of nonnegotiability here is affirmed.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA ruled nonnegotiable a proposal that prevented monitoring of employee performance by clandestine surveillance and limiting the agency to direct observation by supervisors. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr.</span>, 44 FLRA 637, 665 (1992) (Proposal 4 nonnegotiable: precluding use of computerized system to monitor employees on daily basis). In <span class="Italic">West Point Elem. Sch. Teachers Ass'n and U.S. Military Academy West Point Elem. Sch.</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1014 (1990), a proposal was nonnegotiable that prevented the agency from using various techniques to evaluate performance, and that "[a]ll monitoring or observation of the work performance of a contract employee will be conducted openly and with full knowledge of the employee." Also rejected as nonnegotiable was a proposal requiring that evaluations be based on a certain number of observations, each of a certain duration. The decision did not consider whether the proposal was an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Chula Vista Dist.</span>, 38 FLRA 244, 250-51 (1990), rejected as nonnegotiable Provision 1, Sentence 1, providing that employees receive a week of notice prior to desk reviews of employees' performance. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement. The benefit to the employees, reduction of stress and an opportunity to correct deficiencies prior to audit, was outweighed by the agency's need for information concerning the employees' day-to-day organization and workload management.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA initially declared negotiable a proposal calling on management to adopt a random sampling procedure for auditing employee performance. The procedure was not the sole one available to management. It did not prevent management from more closely examining the work of employees identified as substandard. The sampling plan could not, however, identify the particular employees to perform the sampling. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 15 FLRA 909, 915 (1984). It was subsequently decided that proposals that limit management's ability to determine what sampling techniques and measures it will use for evaluating performance of employees are nonnegotiable integral aspects of the right to direct, assign, and evaluate work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760</span> was overruled. <span class="Italic">SSA Northeastern Program Serv. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 18 FLRA 437 (1985). The latter was a ULP case and involved a more extensive record than an earlier negotiability determination on the same issue in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1760</span>, 15 FLRA 909 (1984). Based on the opposite result being reached in the later decision on a more extensive record, FLRA reversed itself on the negotiability result following the submission of an agency petition for reconsideration. A proposal that management sample work based on computer selections was nonnegotiable because not all work was computer controlled; the proposal prevented the agency from sampling other work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1454 and VA</span>, 26 FLRA 848 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 817 (1991) (Proposal 14 nonnegotiable: proposal would preclude review of employee's work product until employee had chance to review it for accuracy). Nonnegotiable was a proposal that precluded the agency from using quality review study results in the performance appraisal process. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1482 and DOD, DMA, Louisville</span>, 39 FLRA 1169 (1991) (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was nonnegotiable that restricted the agency from changing the type and percentage of work reviewed for performance appraisal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 28 FLRA 714, 716-17 (1987) (Proposal 3). As to the amount of work to be reviewed in formulating an appraisal, FLRA determined to be nonnegotiable Provision 1 in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 47 FLRA 705, 706, 713-14 (1993), that "[a] determination of 'decrease in performance' must be predicated upon a considerable body of work appropriate to the nature of the decrease rather than isolated, infrequent or occasional instances":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision would apply only to an employee who receives an appraisal that is lower than the appraisal received the previous year.&#x2003;We find that this provision is intended to address the adverse effects that flow from a decrease in an employee's performance appraisal and, therefore, that it constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to the question of whether this provision is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work.... [A] decrease in an employee's performance appraisal can have far-reaching and significant effects on the employee's employment relationship, affecting matters ranging from the employee's continued employment to the employee's potential for career advancement. This provision would offer a significant benefit to employees by prohibiting the Agency from using isolated, infrequent, or occasional instances as a basis for a decrease in an employee's performance appraisal in any performance element of at least one rating level lower than that received in the prior year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the Agency has a significant interest in being able to hold employees accountable for their performance by establishing and enforcing performance standards. This interest extends to instances of performance that are isolated, infrequent, or occasional. By ensuring that isolated, infrequent, or occasional instances could not have a negative impact on an employee's performance appraisal, this provision would severely hamper the Agency's ability to hold employees accountable for that performance. Additionally, we note that, as discussed above, this provision does not permit the Agency to make judgments based on the seriousness of a particular lapse but would require that each event's effect on an employee's performance rating be determined solely on the basis of frequency of occurrence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the restrictions that Provision 1 places on management's rights to direct employees and assign work outweigh the benefits to employees and that this provision excessively interferes with those rights. Consequently, it is not negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Chula Vista Dist.</span>, 38 FLRA 244, 252, 254 (1990), approved as negotiable Provision 1, Sentence 2, that desk (performance) reviews reflect any absence and any additional adjudication time within <span id="page_1094"></span>the 30-day period preceding the review. From the union's explanation FLRA concluded that the proposal was meant to require management to consider the designated information as part of a desk review; the term did not require the agency to use the information record in any particular manner in evaluation of employees. The proposal was consistent with others that identified certain information that management would consider when evaluating employees. Negotiable was Proposal 4 in <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 48 FLRA 129, 152 (1993): "Any time used to redo work that was otherwise correctly done as a result of a management directed change in the requirements for a classification order shall be accounted for separately from the time originally assigned to the project."</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposal 10 of <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 39 FLRA 783, 808-10 (1991), involved the methodology of work review conducted by two or more reviewers. The proposal stated that "[i]n order to insure that reviews are conducted independently, each reviewer will remove his review sheet and any other notes or comments from the case being reviewed before passing the case to the next reviewer. In addition, while the review is under way, no reviewer will discuss any aspect of the review with anyone else but the employee being reviewed." The proposal was negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal requires only that each reviewer initially review the case free of knowledge of any other reviewer's opinion of the work contained in the case. The proposal in no way affects the standards the reviewers are to apply or any other matter that may affect a reviewer's substantive evaluation of the work. We reject the Agency's contention that the proposal interferes with its deliberative process in evaluating the examiner's work on a case under review. The Union's statement that the proposal does not preclude discussion among management officials subsequent to the independent reviews is consistent with the wording of the proposal. It is clear that once the initial reviews are complete, the reviewers may discuss the case among themselves, and with the employee's Group Manager, and may then deliberate without constraints, prior to a final determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently rejected arguments that certain procedures interfere with management's rights simply because they would require the Agency to take some action it might otherwise not take, for example, to forward a case to subsequent reviewers without comment. As any procedural requirement would have that effect, such a conclusion would completely nullify section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.... Where, as here, a proposed procedure places no substantive restraints on an agency's ability to act with respect to its reserved rights, the Authority will find it to be within the agency's obligation to bargain....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the Union states that Proposal 10 is intended as a response to the occasional problem caused by a second reviewer who may be prejudiced in a review by the comments of a previous reviewer.&#x2003;This proposal is intended to eliminate that problem by ensuring that each interview is free of such influences. Thus, we conclude that the proposal is intended to be an arrangement to ameliorate the adverse effects on examiners of such a practice. As stated above, we find that Proposal 10 does not directly interfere with management's rights. But even if there were some interference with these rights, the significant benefit to the employee of receiving a more objective evaluation would outweigh that burden on management, and the proposal would constitute an appropriate arrangement....</p>
<p class="noindent">A union could not negotiate a requirement that management request a study on employee duties and responsibilities. The proposal interfered with management's ability to assign work and, to the extent that the proposal required the study to be performed on a priority basis, also interfered with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-89 and Hq., Army Air Defense Ctr.</span>, 9 FLRA 1033, 1034 (1982) (Proposal 2). A proposal was not negotiable that compelled an agency employee to prepare a summary of quality review results once a month for training purposes. Because the proposal required the assignment of work, it precluded the assignment of work by the agency. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 6 FLRA 508, 520 (1981).</p>
