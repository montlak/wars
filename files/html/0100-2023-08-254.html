<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-249"><span class="space">a.</span> Incorrect or Inadequate Notice From Agency</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An election that is induced by fraud or incorrect information from the employer is not binding. The Board's jurisdiction is not defeated if an employee files a grievance as a result of misleading information from the agency. A late appeal will be accepted if the agency incorrectly advises the appellant of her right to pursue an agency grievance procedure and it is later determined that the grievance is not arbitrable because the employee is not part of the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Blanshan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 23 MSPR 84, 86 (1984), the appellant was misled by an agency personnel specialist into thinking that he could only file a grievance to contest a RIF. The Board decided that filing the grievance did not divest the Board of jurisdiction when the appellant, recognizing the error, filed a Board appeal that included an allegation of discrimination. If, during a RIF, the agency fails to notify the appellant of the right to a Board appeal and the right to file a grievance, the agency has not provided the proper notice of potential avenues of recourse. Use of the grievance procedure is not then viewed as an informed election; there is a right to a Board appeal when the appellant is informed of the option. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 447, 450 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see Fierro v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 35 MSPR 618, 620 (1987) (suggesting that if the RIF notice was clear as to Board appeal rights, but the appellants misinterpreted their negotiated agreement and improperly selected arbitration, the Board will not assume jurisdiction of an otherwise untimely appeal based on an arbitrator's nonfinal directive to an agency to permit the Board appeal without objection) (<span class="Italic">see</span> 37 MSPR 609, 612 (1988), <span class="Italic">post</span>, for the continuation of <span class="Italic">Fierro</span>)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of notice of appellate and grievance rights was explained, <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 15, 20 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency notes that 5 USC 7121(e)(1) provides in part that, when a matter is covered both by 5 USC 7513 and by a negotiated grievance procedure, the matter may not be pursued in both an appeal and a grievance. It contends that the appellant's filing of grievances related to his medical disqualification precludes him, under 5 USC 7121(e)(1), from pursuing an appeal to the Board. The Board has held, however, that an employee's filing of a grievance does not constitute an informed election under section 7121 when the agency failed to afford the employee proper notice of his potential avenues of recourse. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 447, 450 (1985). The agency in this case has not shown--or even alleged--that it ever notified the appellant of his right to file an appeal or of any limitations on that right. To the contrary, it evidently has maintained consistently that the appellant has no appeal rights from the action at issue. In addition, the agency has failed to show or allege that the appellant was aware either of his appeal rights or of the provisions of 5 USC 7121(e)(1) before he filed his appeal. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's filing of grievances does not constitute a valid, informed election under 5 USC 7121.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Webster v. VA</span>, CH-0752-14-0268-I-1 (NP 9/5/2014) ("Once a timely filing is made to pursue a path, the other is forever waived. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 804 F.2d 673, 675 (Fed. Cir. 1986). An agency must notify the employee of his options under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) for his choice to be deemed a valid, informed election. <span class="Italic">Miyai v. Department of Transportation</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 15, 20 (1986); <span class="Italic">see Atanus v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 434 F.3d 1324, 1327 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee subjected to an adverse action, such as a removal, and who is covered by a negotiated grievance procedure may challenge such an action by filing either a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure or a Board appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, "but not both."[1] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). An employee is deemed to have exercised an option when the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, for an election of an option to be binding, it must be knowing and informed. <span class="Italic">Agoranos v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 16 (2013). The Board has held that, when an agency takes an action without informing the appellant of her procedural options under section 7121 and the preclusive effect of electing one of those options, any subsequent election by the appellant is not binding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">cf. Johnson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2014) (finding that the appellant's election to grieve his removal was not binding because the agency's removal decision did not inform him of his right to file a request for corrective action with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), or of the effect that filing a grievance would have on his right to file an OSC complaint and a subsequent individual right of action appeal before the Board), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 611 F. App'x 496 (10th Cir. 2015).[2] For this reason, the Board's regulations require that, when an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter appealable to the Board, it must provide the employee with notice of the available avenues of relief and the preclusive effect any election will have on the employee's Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d)(1). In particular, when an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with, among other things, notice of any right the employee has to file a grievance or seek corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, including "[w]hether the election of any applicable grievance procedure will result in waiver of the employee's right to file an appeal with the Board." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In proposing this regulation, the Board emphasized that "it is especially important that the agency notice of MSPB appeal rights required by 5 CFR 1201.21 fully explain the consequences of choosing the appeal or grievance procedure" and that "[g]iven the various laws and [collective bargaining agreements] that come into play, it is essential that agency notices of appeal and grievance rights state the situation clearly with respect to the particular employee against whom the action is being taken." Practices and Procedures, 64 Fed. Reg. 58,798 (Nov. 1, 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Additional avenues of relief are available when an employee who is subjected to an action appealable to the Board alleges that she has been affected by a prohibited personnel practice. When alleging a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), <span id="Page_409"></span>the employee may elect one and only one of the following: (1) a statutory procedure, i.e., a Board appeal or an equal employment opportunity complaint; or (2) a grievance under the applicable negotiated grievance procedures. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). When alleging a prohibited personnel practice other than under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), the employee may elect one and only one of the following: (1) an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; (2) a grievance under the applicable negotiated grievance procedures; or (3) a complaint seeking corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, subchapters II and III. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's Notice of Decision to Remove provided, in relevant part</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;If you consider this action improper, you are entitled to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) Appeal this action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or (b) Seek corrective action before the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) or (c) File a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure or (d) A discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You shall be deemed to have exercised your option to appeal the adverse action at such time as you timely initiate action to appeal to the Board, or the OSC, or timely file a grievance in writing under the negotiated grievance procedure, or a discrimination complaint.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After setting forth the methods for submitting an appeal with the Board, seeking corrective action from OSC, filing a grievance, and filing a complaint of discrimination, the decision notice indicated that "[w]hichever is filed first, an appeal to the MSPB, an appeal for corrective action to OSC, a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, or a discrimination complaint, shall be considered an election by you to proceed under that appeal process."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant elected to grieve her removal, notwithstanding the union's purported decision not to arbitrate the appellant's grievance of her removal. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. Department of Justice</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 10 (2000). Nevertheless, nothing in the record demonstrates that the agency fully explained the consequences of choosing the appeal or grievance procedure. The decision letter did not explicitly inform the appellant that she could raise the matter at issue with the Board or under the negotiated grievance procedure, "but not both," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), nor did it provide her with notice as to "[w]hether the election of any applicable grievance procedure will result in waiver of the employee's right to file an appeal with the Board,"[3] 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d)(1). Thus, we find that the appellant did not make a knowing and informed election and did not waive her right to file a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Agoranos</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 498, &#x00B6; 17; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(d)(1).[4] Accordingly, we remand the appeal for adjudication of the merits of the agency's removal action.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Agencies may wish to review and update, if necessary, the notice of appeal rights language in their decision notices consistent with the applicable statutes and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;During the pendency of this appeal, Congress enacted the National Defense Authorization Act of 2018 (2018 NDAA), effective December 12, 2017. Pub. L. No. 115-91, 131 Stat. 1283 (2017). The 2018 NDAA codified, with respect to an action taken under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503(b)(1), 7513(b)(1), or 7543(b)(1), an agency's obligation to notify an employee of her right to appeal an action brought under one of the applicable sections, the forums in which she may file her appeal, and any limitations on her rights that would apply because of her forum selection. 2018 NDAA &#x00A7; 1097(b)(2), 131 Stat. at 1617 (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7503 Note). We need not consider the retroactivity of this provision and whether the agency also failed to comply with this statutory requirement given our finding that the agency did not comply with the Board's regulatory notice requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[5]&#x2003;Section 7121(e)(1) applies to an "aggrieved employee." Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2), a "supervisor" or "management official" is not such an "employee." Supervisors or management officials are, therefore, excepted from the election of remedies provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Requena v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 39, &#x00B6; 11. Although the appellant's title is Drug Demand Reduction Program Manager, we need not address whether to apply <span class="Italic">Requena</span> in this case because the record appears to indicate that she is not a supervisor or management official, and we have otherwise found that her election was invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency's advice concerning election of remedies need not be purposefully misleading to permit an employee to avoid an election. Incorrect information, although provided by the agency in good faith, permits the employee to disavow a grievance election and proceed to the Board, as <span class="Italic">Delaney v. AID</span>, 80 MSPR 146, 150-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-15 (1998), explained in a challenge by a foreign service employee to a RIF that he thought could be challenged before either the Foreign Service Grievance Board or the MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Secretary of State is authorized to conduct a RIF in the Foreign Service. 22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(a). A Foreign Service RIF triggers the following statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee against whom an action is taken under this section may elect to file either a grievance under subchapter XI of this chapter or to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under procedures prescribed by the Board. Grievances under subchapter XI of this chapter shall be limited to cases of reprisal, interference in the conduct of an employee's official duties, or similarly inappropriate use of the authority of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(c)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a personnel action if the appellant has already elected to challenge that action through another means under a statute requiring an election of just one avenue of redress.... An individual's decision to pursue a particular avenue of redress under a statute requiring an election will not be binding, however, if the decision was not an informed one, that is, if the decision was based on misleading or inadequate information....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find in the present case that the appellant's decision to file a grievance was not an informed one, because the agency did not adequately advise him of the limits on the scope of a grievance. The appellant avers in an affidavit...that he believed the FSGB would have jurisdiction over all matters raised in the second grievance because he believed his arguments were claims that the agency "improperly used RIF authority." The appellant's belief, although erroneous, was not unreasonable. Based on the notice regarding appeals and grievances that he received, there is no reason why it should have been apparent to him that the "similarly inappropriate use of RIF authority" language did not encompass his claim that the agency misinterpreted or misapplied law and regulation when it drew up RIF retention registers and reached him for separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Supporting our finding that the appellant's belief about the scope of his grievance rights was reasonable is the FSGB's letter acknowledging receipt of the second grievance. The FSGB stated that it had "no reason" to question its jurisdiction over the grievance, and that it would consider "all aspects" of it. If the FSGB--the expert body regarding the scope of Foreign Service grievances--initially did not believe that the appellant's second grievance presented some claims that were not actually grievable, we cannot say that the appellant acted unreasonably and should have been aware of the limitations on his grievance rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the FSGB has found that at the relevant time, there was no authoritative guidance on the scope of Foreign Service RIF grievances. In a seminal decision issued over 8 months after the RIF, and over 11 months after the appellant filed his second grievance, the FSGB held (in a decision involving another employee) that 22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(c) limits the scope of Foreign Service RIF grievances to those in which the grievant claims that the agency invoked its RIF authority in bad faith. According to the FSGB, section 4010a(c) precludes FSGB review of the "ordinary planning for, and ordinary operation of, a RIF." The FSGB remarked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">There have been legitimate differences of opinion among all parties as to what properly is meant by the legislative phrase "similarly inappropriate use of the authority of this section." [22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(c).] The meaning of this legislation required interpretation, and it is only now that we have given it.... [The notice concerning "Grievance [and] Appeals Information" provided with the RIF notices] essentially repeated the formal language of the legislation which defined this Board's limited review authority. It did not compare or contrast this authority with that of the MSPB or otherwise provide helpful operational guidance.... It is this Board's view that the language used by the agency in advising Foreign Service employees of their appeal rights was inartfully drafted and confusing to even relatively sophisticated individuals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15. We do not expect the appellant to have understood the scope of his grievance rights, when the authoritative body on such rights has found that the agency's notice was unclear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below that it "was in no position" to offer guidance on the meaning of 22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(c) when it issued RIF notices because the RIF "was the first to be conducted under the statute." According to the agency, "it is the domain of the FSGB to interpret first the scope of it jurisdiction," so "to the extent the appellant's decision [to file a grievance after he received the RIF notice] was 'uninformed,' it was through no fault of the agency." This argument misses the point. The question is not <span id="Page_410"></span>whether the agency was at fault, <span class="Italic">cf. Covington, supra,</span> but rather, whether the appellant was adequately informed that the scope of his grievance rights was much more limited than the scope of an MSPB appeal. The agency's argument is really a tacit admission that the appellant did <span class="Italic">not</span> have, and <span class="Italic">could not</span> have had, adequate information at the time of the RIF because the authoritative body on Foreign Service RIF grievance rights had yet to render a definitive interpretation of 22 USCA &#x00A7; 4010a(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zendejas v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ZENDEJAS_JESSE_G_SF_0752_07_0383_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_301893.pdf">107 MSPR 348</a>, 350-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 4-8, 2007 MSPB 283 (2007), suggested, although it did not specifically determine, that the misunderstanding of the appellant could constitute a basis to reinstate an adverse action appeal that was withdrawn to permit the appellant to pursue a grievance process that the appellant later found to be foreclosed. The Board's opinion did not state that the misunderstanding must result from misrepresentations from the agency or from the AJ who dismissed the original appeal, although the opinion suggested that the appellant's misunderstanding of the available choices could and should have been corrected by the AJ or the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the agency's decision to remove him from the position of Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) Officer, GS-7, based on a charge of Failure to Meet a Condition of Employment following his alleged refusal to complete a required CBP law enforcement training course. Shortly after filing the appeal, the appellant submitted a written request to withdraw the appeal in order to "address[ ] the matter through the CBP/EEO process. The administrative judge issued an order notifying the appellant that withdrawal of the appeal would prevent him from refiling it in the future and affording him 7 days to consider his decision. After neither party responded to the order, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's submissions to the Board following the dismissal of his appeal have heretofore been treated, cumulatively, as a petition for review, the Board has determined that it is generally appropriate to treat a request for reconsideration of an appellant-initiated dismissal of a petition for appeal as a late-filed petition for appeal or as a request to reopen and reinstate a prior appeal. <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 601, &#x00B6; 3 (2000). Here, we will treat the appellant's submission as a request to reopen his original appeal.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant states that he and his representative "were under the impression that [they] could get better results in correcting the adverse job termination from CBP" at the time the appeal was withdrawn. He also indicates that, after the withdrawal of his appeal, his representative attempted to challenge the removal through the arbitration procedure, that he later "realiz[ed] that CBP would not honor the unions [sic] contract and rules governing the right to arbitration"; that his representative subsequently "decided to try CBP's informal mediation process"; that a mediation meeting was held and another was scheduled; but that "CBP cancelled the [second scheduled] meeting by stating that the dead line [sic] to go through the mediation process had expired."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's decision to withdraw his appeal ordinarily will be accorded finality, and in the absence of unusual circumstances, the Board will not reinstate an appeal once the appellant has withdrawn it. <span class="Italic">See Spencer v. Railroad Retirement Board,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6; 4 (2002) (noting that the withdrawal of an appeal is an act of finality that removes the appeal from the Board's jurisdiction). The Board has held, however, that a withdrawal based on misinformation or a misunderstanding constitutes an exception to the general finality rule, and that, when those circumstances are present, the adjudication of a subsequent appeal of the same action is not precluded. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 373, &#x00B6; 5 (2000) (in concluding that the dismissal of the appellant's previous appeal should have been without prejudice to its refiling, the Board relied on the appellant's failure to understand, when withdrawing that appeal to challenge his removal in another forum, that he could never refile it with the Board). The appellant's misunderstanding concerning the available means of challenging an adverse action, for example, may result in the Board's deeming the withdrawal to be without prejudice to the refiling and subsequent adjudication of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), an employee who, like the appellant here, has been subjected to an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 may appeal the matter to the Board or pursue the matter through a negotiated grievance procedure under a collective bargaining agreement, but he may not do both. When an employee files a timely Board appeal and a timely grievance under a negotiated grievance procedure concerning the same matter, the action that was taken first generally is regarded as reflecting a binding election to pursue that means of redress. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1). The record in the present appeal indicates that the appellant filed his Board appeal prior to seeking redress through the negotiated grievance procedure, and neither the agency nor the appellant has alleged otherwise. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), therefore, the appellant presumably would be precluded from challenging his removal under the negotiated grievance procedure. The appellant's reference to his intention to "address[ ] the matter through the CBP/EEO process," however, and the subsequent actions he has described in his recent submissions to the Board suggest that he believed, when he withdrew his appeal, that he would still be able to challenge his removal under the negotiated procedure. Moreover, although the administrative judge advised him that he would not be able to refile his appeal with the Board if it was dismissed as withdrawn, nothing in the record suggests that any attempt was made to correct the appellant's apparent misunderstanding about the availability of the other means of redress he had mentioned in his withdrawal request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertions on petition for review suggest that the agency did not permit the appellant to challenge his removal under the negotiated bargaining procedure, and that the appellant's subsequent efforts to challenge the matter through mediation also may have been terminated by the agency. If the appellant was unable to pursue remedies provided under the negotiated bargaining procedure as a result of his prior election to file a Board appeal, and if his withdrawal of his appeal was based on a mistaken belief that he would be able to pursue those remedies, that withdrawal would appear to have been based on a material misunderstanding. Under those circumstances, the withdrawal would not be subject to the general rule of finality described above, and the subsequent dismissal of his appeal would properly be regarded as a dismissal without prejudice to the refiling of that appeal. The record includes little specific evidence concerning these matters, however. We therefore are unable to determine whether the dismissal of the appellant's appeal should be considered to be without prejudice, and whether the appellant's appeal should be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. OPM</span> 86 MSPR 601 (2000), relied on in <span class="Italic">Zendejas, supra,</span> involved an appeal in a disability annuity overpayment case that allegedly was withdrawn by appellant's counsel without her knowledge or consent. <span class="Italic">Caracciolo</span> noted a short line of timeliness cases involving attorneys who thwart appellants' efforts to prosecute their appeals through the negligence or malfeasance of counsel that the Board determines should not be attributed to the appellants. Unclear from <span class="Italic">Zendejas</span> was whether the withdrawal of the Board appeal to pursue grievance arbitration was set aside because of unilateral misunderstanding by the appellant or his representative, because of misrepresentation by the agency or the failure of the agency to correct a misunderstanding by the appellant or his representative known to the agency, or because of the failure of the AJ to fully explain to the appellant the governing jurisdictional points involving election of remedies.</p>
