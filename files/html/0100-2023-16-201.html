<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-201"><span class="space">g.</span> OPM Suitability and Background Investigations</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 506, 509-11 (2012) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 754 F.3d 1031 (D.C. Cir. 2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>), reviewing an arbitrator's award, concluded that investigative interviews by OPM are accompanied by the right to representation when OPM acts an the agency's agent in the investigation of background of excepted service personnel, but not when OPM acts solely on its own behalf in conducting background investigations of competitive service personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). In relevant part, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) states that a union representative shall be given the opportunity to be represented at an "examination of an employee...by a representative of the agency...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). As the Authority has found virtually identical wording in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), "representatives of the agency," to have the same meaning as &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)'s "representative of the agency," the Authority has found precedent under both subsections relevant in assessing who is a representative of the agency. <span class="Italic">See PBGC</span>, 62 FLRA at 223.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has considered the representative status of two types of investigators: those employed in an agency's OIG, and those who are outside contractors who have been hired to perform an agency function. The Union relies primarily on <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, an OIG case. In <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, the United States Supreme Court upheld the Authority's determination that an investigator in the agency's OIG was a representative of the agency, even though the OIG operated with significant autonomy within the agency. <span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 234, 240-41; <span class="Italic">NASA HQ</span>, 50 FLRA at 614-15. <span class="Italic">See also, e.g., Dep't of Def., Def. Criminal Investigative Serv.</span>, 28 FLRA 1145, 1149 (1987) (investigative component of the agency was a representative the agency) (<span class="Italic">DCIS</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. DCIS v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93, 100 (3d Cir. 1988) (investigators employed by agency and investigating employee misconduct were representatives of the agency, regardless of degree of supervision that agency had over investigators).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also cites decisions involving outside contractors.&#x2003;In those decisions, the Authority considered whether the investigator was "performing a function that otherwise would have been performed by the agency, and whether the [agency] exercised any control over the" investigator. <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, 62 FLRA at 223-24 (citing <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 FLRA at 879-80).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Union concedes, the Authority has not previously addressed whether an investigator from one agency can be a representative of another agency. Because this matter involves investigators who are not employed by the Agency, we find most relevant the Authority decisions involving outside contractors. Consistent with those decisions, we consider whether OPM's investigators performed an Agency function, and whether they acted under the Agency's control. <span class="Italic">See PBGC</span>, 62 FLRA at 223-24. We address the two categories of employees at issue here--covered and excepted--separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Covered Employees</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding covered employees, the Arbitrator found that OPM's investigators were carrying out OPM's "investigative function" in connection with making suitability determinations. Award at 10 &#x0026; n.6 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104). <span class="Italic">See also id. </span>at 2 (background investigations were conducted "in connection with making 'suitability' determinations"). <span class="Italic">Accord Harris v. King</span>, No. 98-5826, 2000 WL 353676 at *1 n.1 (6th Cir. Mar. 29, 2000) (unpublished) (OPM is the "governmental agency responsible for conducting suitability determinations" for covered employees). Accordingly, when OPM's investigators were interviewing and investigating covered employees--employees subject to OPM suitability determinations--they were performing an OPM function, not a function or task of the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding who controlled the investigators when interviewing covered employees, the Arbitrator found that OPM's investigators were "legally independent" of the Agency. The Arbitrator found that there was "no basis or authority for [the Agency] to tell OPM how its investigators should go about conducting their investigatory interviews," and found that there was "nothing [the Agency]...[could] do" to change OPM's policy decision "not to permit [U]nion representatives to participate in" the interviews. These findings, which are not challenged as nonfacts (or on any other ground), support a conclusion that OPM's investigators did not act under the Agency's control when interviewing covered employees. Further, the parties stipulated, and do not dispute, that OPM has authority to "make suitability determinations and to take suitability actions" and that OPM "may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction...in any case it deems necessary," <span class="Italic">Accord </span>&#x00A7; 731.103(g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Union does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's failure to consider other factors indicating an outside contractor's representative status--such as the Agency's role in compelling employee participation, the use of the Agency's facilities, and the Agency's access to investigatory files--render the award deficient. Even if the Arbitrator had considered those factors, the Union does not demonstrate that they outweigh the other factors indicating that OPM's investigators performed an OPM function, and acted under OPM's control.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, OPM's investigators were performing an OPM function, and acting under OPM's control, when interviewing covered employees. Accordingly, we find that OPM's investigators were not representatives of the Agency under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute when interviewing those employees, and we deny the Union's exceptions concerning those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Excepted Employees</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding whose function the investigators were performing when interviewing excepted employees, there is no indication that OPM's investigators were carrying out an OPM function. In this regard, "OPM's suitability regulations are specifically limited in scope" to covered employees. <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 290, 294 (1997). Further, the parties stipulated before the Arbitrator, and do not dispute before the Authority, that it is the Agency that is "primarily responsible for the conduct of background investigations" of excepted employees. Thus, the record indicates that OPM's investigators were effectively performing an Agency function when interviewing excepted employees. <span class="Italic">See PBGC</span>, 62 FLRA at 223.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1442"></span>With regard to who controlled OPM's investigators when interviewing excepted employees, there is no indication that OPM's investigators were acting under OPM's authority when interviewing those employees. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101, 731.103. However, the parties stipulated before the Arbitrator, and do not dispute before the Authority, that the Agency is primarily responsible for the conduct of the investigations, and that the Agency "has the authority to remove...excepted [employees] based on information collected during the...investigations." This supports a conclusion that OPM's investigators were acting under the Agency's authority when interviewing excepted employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that OPM has authority to "conduct background investigations for excepted service employees'...<span class="Italic">eligibility for an identity credential</span>." There is no claim or indication that OPM investigators were interviewing excepted employees to determine their eligibility for government identification. Rather, OPM investigators were interviewing excepted employees to investigate their backgrounds and, ultimately, to let the Agency determine whether they should be removed. Thus, the Agency's assertion does not demonstrate that OPM's investigators were carrying out an OPM function, or acting under OPM's authority, when interviewing excepted employees. Further, the Agency does not explain a connection between the information-security-related authorities--15 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 278g-3(a); 40 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 11331; 44 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3543; HSPD-12; FIPS-201-1; and OMB Memo 05-24--and the interviews that OPM's investigators were performing. With regard to E.O. 13,467, that Order pertains to suitability determinations, which do not apply to excepted employees. Likewise, while the Agency asserts that E.O. 10,450 and E.O. 10,577 indicate that "OPM has the authority to conduct background investigations to examine <span class="Italic">suitability for competitive [f]</span><span class="Italic">ederal [e]</span><span class="Italic">mployment</span>," the Agency does not explain how these authorities apply to OPM investigatory interviews of excepted employees, who are not subject to OPM suitability determinations. <span class="Italic">See also </span>E.O. 10,450 at &#x00A7; 8(c) (agencies primarily responsible for investigating excepted employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, even though there is no dispute that OPM "controlled" the terms of the investigations, that is so only because the Agency delegated its authority to investigate excepted employees to OPM. Permitting the Agency to delegate its authority to investigate excepted employees without holding the Agency responsible for its obligations under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, would permit the Agency to evade those obligations and would therefore be contrary to Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See PBGC</span>, 62 FLRA 223 (citing <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 234).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, OPM's investigators were performing an Agency function, and acting under the ultimate control of the Agency, when they interviewed excepted employees. Accordingly, we grant the Union's exceptions insofar as they relate to excepted employees, and find that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute, and Articles 5.4.I.1 and 9.2.C.7 of the CBA, as alleged.[12] Further, pursuant to the Union's request, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine an appropriate remedy. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS Accounts Mgmt. &#x0026; Compliance Servs., Wage &#x0026; Invs. &#x0026; Small Bus./Self Employed Div.</span>, 66 FLRA 186, 191 (2011) (remanding for remedy for agency's violation of the Statute and the parties' agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;In this connection, there is no dispute that if OPM's investigators were representatives of the Agency, then the Agency violated the Statute and the CBA as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 754 F.3d 1031, 1034-38, 1041-47 (D.C. Cir. 2014), as to the unavailability of representation rights when OPM investigated covered (competitive service) employees for suitability:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU or Union) petitions the Court for review of a Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) decision finding&#x00B8; <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) did not commit an unfair labor practice when Union representatives were excluded from "suitability" interviews of "covered" IRS personnel conducted by Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigators. Under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS or Statute), union representatives are permitted to attend "any examination" of a federal employee the union represents if (1) the examination is conducted by a "representative" of the employing agency and (2) the employee requests representation and reasonably believes that the meeting may result in disciplinary action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). The FLRA determined that covered IRS personnel are not entitled to union representation at suitability interviews conducted by OPM investigators because OPM investigators do not act as "representatives" of the IRS during the interviews. For the reasons set forth below, we deny NTEU's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS "establishes a collective bargaining regime in the federal public sector," <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, 414 F.3d 50, 52 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quotation marks omitted), and codifies "various labor rights" accorded federal employees, <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 3669 v. Shinseki</span>, 709 F.3d 29, 30 (D.C. Cir. 2013). It expressly grants a federal employee and his union certain rights, known as "<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights,"[1] including that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]n exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at...any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if...(i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;"<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights" refers to the United States Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc</span>., 420 U.S. 251 (1975). There, the Court upheld the National Labor Relations Board's determination that, under section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 157, an employee represented by a union is entitled to union representation during an interview the employee reasonably believes will result in discipline. <span class="Italic">See Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 260-64.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). A federal employer's failure to provide an employee his statutorily conferred <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights constitutes an unfair labor practice under the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) (unfair labor practice for federal employer "to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(8) (unfair labor practice for federal employer "to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question before us is whether the statutory <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights of certain "covered" IRS personnel are triggered when an OPM investigator conducts a "suitability" interview of them. A covered position is "a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). Notwithstanding exceptions inapplicable here, an individual seeking covered employment must undergo an investigation in order to determine his "suitability for employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.104(a). The President, to whom the Congress has granted broad authority to regulate entry in the civil service, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3301, 3302, has delegated to OPM the authority to conduct the suitability investigation, <span class="Italic">see Dickson v. OPM</span>, 828 F.2d 32, 33-34 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("[T]he President has delegated to OPM, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the authority...to investigate and determine the suitability of persons entering or employed in nonsensitive positions within the competitive civil service." (citing Exec. Order No. 10,450)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(a) ("[A]ppointments to covered positions<span class="Italic">...</span>require the person to undergo an investigation <span class="Italic">by OPM</span> or by an agency with delegated authority <span class="Italic">from OPM</span> to conduct investigations." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 736.201(a) ("[T]he investigation of persons entering or employed in the competitive service, or by career appointment in the Senior Executive Service, is the responsibility of OPM."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 5.2(a) (OPM Director may investigate "the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service"). As part of the suitability investigation, the covered IRS personnel at issue here are required to participate in an interview. OPM has the authority to sanction anyone who refuses to furnish testimony during a suitability interview. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g).[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;"Excepted service" personnel are those IRS personnel who are not "covered." Excepted service appointments "include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by OPM." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.4(a). Although an individual appointed to an excepted service position with the IRS is not required to undergo a suitability investigation, the IRS does require the individual to undergo a background investigation, which includes an interview component. OPM also conducts this background investigation and interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Until 2008, the IRS used its own investigators to investigate and interview both covered and excepted personnel. As noted, the investigation of a covered individual is an OPM prerogative but an agency may annually request a delegation of authority from OPM to conduct its own suitability investigation of an individual seeking covered employment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 736.201(b). The IRS requested and received such authority each year until 2008. When the IRS conducted its own investigations and interviews (both suitability and non-suitability), it permitted NTEU representatives to attend suitability interviews of covered personnel and background interviews of excepted personnel on official time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2008, the IRS did not renew its request for authority to conduct suitability investigations and, as a result, the delegation from OPM lapsed. Subsequently, OPM investigators began conducting suitability investigations of covered IRS personnel and also took over the background investigation of excepted IRS personnel. Because OPM's policy prohibits NTEU representatives from attending investigatory interviews of both covered and excepted personnel, the IRS stopped giving Union representatives official time to attend interviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the IRS no longer conducts suitability or background investigations, it has retained a role in the investigatory process. For <span id="Page_1443"></span>example, the IRS initiates investigations of all candidates for employment by requiring them to complete certain forms and, once the forms are complete, it authorizes OPM to proceed with an investigation. In addition, interviews are often conducted during IRS business hours and in IRS work space and personnel must obtain permission from IRS supervisors before attending the interviews. The IRS informs candidates that they are required to participate in the investigatory interviews as a condition of employment and are subject to discipline if they do not cooperate. Finally, the IRS typically retains the investigation file assembled by OPM at the end of an investigation. The suitability and background investigations are "management's tool" for evaluating "character, honesty, integrity and loyalty." Joint Appendix (JA) 248, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, No. 12-1199 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 14, 2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At the conclusion of the suitability investigation, a covered individual receives a "suitability determination." A "suitability determination" is "a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority that a person is suitable or is not suitable for employment in covered positions in the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). Pursuant to a standing OPM delegation, the IRS makes the suitability determinations for "applicants" for, and "appointees" to, covered positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a). An applicant is "a person who is being considered or has been considered for employment" and an "appointee" is "a person who has entered on duty and is in the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). The IRS's authority to make a suitability determination for an applicant or appointee, however, is not without limits, to wit: the IRS must conform to OPM policies and standards in making suitability determinations, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 731.103(c), and OPM reserves the right to revoke its suitability determination delegation if the IRS fails to do so, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 731.103(f); OPM oversees the IRS's exercise of its authority to make suitability determinations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(b)(2);[3] OPM retains jurisdiction of a case "where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment" and of a case "involving a refusal to furnish testimony," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g); the IRS must refer cases to OPM when "Governmentwide debarment by OPM...may be an appropriate action," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.103(b); and OPM "may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction...in any case it deems necessary," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.103(g). Although the IRS makes the suitability determination with respect to an <span class="Italic">applicant</span> and <span class="Italic">appointee</span>, it does not do so with respect to another, discrete category of IRS personnel, namely, a covered IRS "<span class="Italic">employee</span>."[4] <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.105(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Congress has directed OPM to "establish and maintain an oversight program to ensure that activities under any authority delegated [from OPM to an agency] are in accordance with the merit system principles and the [OPM] standards." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;An "employee" is "a person who has <span class="Italic">completed</span> the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to OPM's policy of excluding NTEU representatives from investigatory interviews and the IRS's corresponding failure to give Union representatives official time to attend the interviews, NTEU filed two grievances against the IRS. The Union alleged, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the failure to allow Union representatives to attend suitability and background investigation interviews of IRS personnel on official time constituted an unfair labor practice under section 7116(a)(1), (8) of the FSLMRS as well as a violation of the IRS's collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with NTEU. The parties could not resolve the dispute and the grievances were eventually submitted to an arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator denied NTEU's grievances, concluding that IRS personnel are not entitled to union representation at investigatory interviews conducted by OPM investigators. The statutory <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights of IRS personnel are not triggered by an interview conducted by OPM investigators, he found, because OPM investigators do not act as "representatives" of the IRS during the interview. In the arbitrator's view, OPM investigators are "legally independent" and the IRS has no authority "to tell OPM how its investigators should go about conducting their investigatory interviews." According to the arbitrator, "[t]here is nothing IRS or NTEU can do about" OPM's decision "not to permit union representatives to participate in" the interviews. Based on these determinations, the arbitrator concluded that the exclusion of NTEU representatives from interviews of IRS personnel does not constitute a violation of the Statute or the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed exceptions to the arbitrator's decision with the FLRA, making the same argument it had made to the arbitrator. In the alternative, it argued that OPM investigators act as IRS representatives at least when they investigate excepted personnel (that is, personnel who are excepted under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.4(a), <span class="Italic">see supra</span> note 2) and that the failure to allow union representation for them violates the Statute and the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 22, 2012, the FLRA granted in part and denied in part the Union's exceptions. It denied the Union's exceptions with respect to covered personnel, finding that OPM investigators do not act as IRS representatives when they interview them in the course of a suitability investigation. The FLRA interpreted "representative of the agency" as used in section 7114 of the Statute to require the same "function" and "control" analysis it had used in the past in cases involving an outside contractor as a representative of an agency. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 506, 509-10 (2012) (citing <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp</span>. (<span class="Italic">PBGC</span>), 62 F.L.R.A. 219 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Social Security Admin</span>. (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), 59 F.L.R.A. 875 (2004))). Under its function and control test, an individual is a representative of an agency if he (1) performs an agency function and (2) operates under agency control. Applying the test, the Authority first concluded that OPM investigators "were performing an OPM function" (and not any IRS function) when "interviewing and investigating covered [individuals]...subject to OPM suitability determinations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 510 (quotation marks omitted). The Authority also determined that OPM investigators do not operate under IRS control during interviews of covered personnel because, as the arbitrator found, OPM investigators are "legally independent" of the IRS and the IRS has "no basis or authority...to tell OPM how its investigators should go about conducting their investigatory interviews." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quotation marks omitted). The Authority noted that NTEU did not challenge the arbitrator's determinations as "nonfacts (or on any other ground)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In denying the Union's exceptions with respect to covered personnel, the Authority necessarily concluded that the IRS had not committed an unfair labor practice or violated the CBA by failing to ensure union representation during OPM interviews of covered personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, however, granted NTEU's exceptions with respect to excepted personnel. It concluded that OPM investigators do perform an IRS function when they interview excepted individuals in conjunction with a background investigation because the IRS, not OPM, is "primarily responsible for the conduct of background investigations" of excepted personnel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Authority determined that OPM investigators operate under the "ultimate control" of the IRS when investigating excepted personnel because the IRS has "the authority to remove excepted employees based on information collected during the investigations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 510-11 (citation, quotation marks, brackets and ellipses omitted). In light of these determinations, the Authority held that excepted individuals are entitled to union representation at their OPM background investigation interviews pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) and that the IRS committed an unfair labor practice and violated the CBA by not ensuring such representation. It remanded the award "to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine an appropriate remedy." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 511.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union timely petitioned for review of the Authority's decision, but only in part. It limits its requested review to the Authority's determination that the exclusion of Union representatives from suitability interviews of covered IRS <span class="Italic">appointees</span>--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, covered personnel who have "entered on duty and [are] in the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b)--is not an unfair labor practice under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, No. 12-1199 (D.C. Cir.

<p class="noindent-1">We review Authority decisions in accordance with section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, "uphold[ing] [the Authority's] determinations unless they are 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">Am.

<p class="noindent-1">As explained above, the Statute provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]n exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at...any <span id="Page_1444"></span>examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if...(i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). The parties stipulated before the arbitrator that some IRS personnel reasonably fear discipline resulting from the suitability interviews conducted by OPM investigators and it is clear that some have requested union representation at the interviews. Thus, the applicability of section 7114(a)(2)(B)--and, consequently, whether the IRS committed an unfair labor practice--turns on whether OPM investigators act as "representatives" of the IRS when they conduct interviews of individuals appointed to covered positions with the IRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that an individual who is not an agency employee may nonetheless act as a "representative" of the agency if he (1) performs an agency function and (2) is subject to agency control. Applying this interpretation of the Statute, the Authority then concluded that OPM investigators do not act as IRS representatives when they interview covered personnel as part of a suitability investigation because they do not perform an IRS function or operate under IRS control. We first review the Authority's reading of the Statute and then consider whether the Authority properly applied its reading to the facts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step one, the Court must determine whether the statute is ambiguous with respect "to the precise question at issue"--that is, the meaning of "representative of the agency." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43.

<p class="noindent-1">We believe the meaning of "representative of the agency" is ambiguous as there is nothing in the text of the Statute that gives precision to the broad phrase or otherwise evinces a clear congressional intent to foreclose the Authority's interpretation. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Section 7114(a)(2)(A) also uses "representative[&#8197;] of the agency." The Authority has recognized that the phrase has the same meaning and scope in both section 7114(a)(2)(A) and 7114(a)(2)(B) and that precedent interpreting one section is applicable to cases interpreting the other. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., PBGC</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. at 223.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step two, "the question for the court is whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute in light of its language, structure, and purpose." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Labor v. Chao</span>, 409 F.3d 377, 384 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quotation marks and citation omitted). We need not conclude that the Authority's interpretation of the Statute is "the only one it permissibly could have adopted," <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 n.11, or "even the interpretation deemed <span class="Italic">most</span> reasonable by the courts," <span class="Italic">Entergy Corp. v.

IRS</span>, 742 F.3d 1013, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before this case, the Authority had not addressed the issue of when an employee of one agency acts as a "representative" of a different agency. The Union urged the Authority to look to <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 527 U.S. 229 (1999), for guidance. In <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, the Supreme Court upheld the Authority's determination that investigators employed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Office of Inspector General (NASA-OIG) are "representatives" of NASA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 237-43. Although NASA-OIG investigators enjoy considerable autonomy, the Court concluded that "the investigators employed in NASA's OIG are unquestionably 'representatives' of NASA when acting within the scope of their employment" because OIG investigations are "performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 240. In concluding that the investigations were conducted on behalf of NASA, the Court relied in part on the fact that section 3 of the Inspector General Act (IGA) requires OIG investigators to "report to and be under the general supervision of the head of the [agency] involved or, to the extent such authority is delegated, the officer next in rank below such head." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 239 (quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 240 (excepting congressional committees and the President, "each Inspector General has no supervising authority--except the head of the agency of which the OIG is a part"); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 266 F.3d 1228, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("The <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court relied at least in part on [section 3 of the IGA] in holding that OIG agents are 'representatives' of their respective agencies."). As part of his supervision of the NASA-OIG, the NASA Administrator had "the ability to require its Inspector General to comply with, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, equal employment opportunity regulations." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 240 n.4. Significantly, the Court made clear that its decision was limited to interpreting section 7114 in relation to the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights of agency personnel investigated by that agency's OIG. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 244 ("To resolve the question presented in this case, we need not agree or disagree with the Authority's various rulings regarding the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)...."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 244 n.8 ("The process by which the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) may properly be determined, and the application of that section to law enforcement officials with a broader charge, present distinct questions not now before us."); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice</span>, 266 F.3d at 1232 (applying <span class="Italic">NASA</span> to DOJ OIG investigators but noting, "[a]s was true for the Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>," there was no need to address application of section 7114(a)(2)(B) to joint OIG/FBI investigators); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>. (<span class="Italic">USDHS</span>) <span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, No. 12-1457, slip op. at 10-13 (D.C. Cir. June 3, 2014).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority rejected the Union's suggestion to follow <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, choosing instead to rely on its precedent involving outside contractors. In its contractor cases, the Authority assessed whether contractors hired to perform agency investigations acted as representatives of the hiring agency by examining whether the contractors were performing a "function" of the agency and operating under the agency's "control." <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. at 223-24 (asking "whether the contractor was performing a function that otherwise would have been performed by the agency, and whether the [agency] exercised any control over the contractor"); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. at 880 (contractor acted as representative of agency during investigation because investigation was "an official obligation" of agency and contractor performed investigation under agency's "control and direction"). The Authority reasoned that, "[b]ecause this matter involves investigators who are not employed by the Agency," the "most relevant" precedent is the outside contractor cases, not <span class="Italic">NASA</span>. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 509-10. Accordingly, the Authority used the "function and control" analysis to determine whether OPM investigators act as representatives of the IRS during suitability interviews of IRS personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the standard employed by the FLRA is "unreasonably at odds with <span class="Italic">NASA</span>" and "the purpose of Section 7114 itself." According to the Union, the Authority's "function and control" test is inconsistent with both the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> and the <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span> holdings because they "make clear that investigators can be 'representatives' of an agency even when they are operating under their own legal authority and insulated from agency interference or control." The Union further contends that the Authority's interpretation frustrates the Congress's goal, furthered by <span class="Italic">NASA's</span> interpretation of "representative," of providing fair treatment to federal employees under investigation. Specifically, the Union asserts that in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, the Court adopted a broad reading of "representative" both to ensure that an agency cannot side-step its statutory representational duties by outsourcing investigatory tasks and in recognition of the fact that "the participation of a union representative will facilitate a factfinding process and a fair resolution of an agency investigation." (quoting <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 245). NTEU contends that, by reading the Statute in an "unduly narrow" way, the Authority encourages outsourcing and prevents the valuable participation of union representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's interpretation of section 7114 seems eminently reasonable to us. As an initial matter, we note that <span class="Italic">NASA</span> does not mandate a particular reading of "representative of the agency" here. As the Supreme Court made plain in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 527 U.S. at 244 &#x0026; n.8, and as we ourselves have recognized, <span class="Italic">NASA</span> is not to be severed from its factual moorings, <span class="Italic">see Dep't of Justice</span>, 266 F.3d at 1232; <span class="Italic">see also USDHS</span>, No. 12-1457, slip op. at 10-13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor was it unreasonable for the Authority to draw on its own outside contractor cases--and not <span class="Italic">NASA</span>--in construing section 7114. Despite the considerable autonomy enjoyed by the NASA-OIG investigators, they were nonetheless employed by NASA and supervised by the NASA Administrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> 527 U.S. at 239-42. In <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. FLRA</span>, we concluded that it was the relationship between the OIG investigators and the NASA Administrator that the Supreme Court had relied on, at least in part, in finding that they were acting as NASA representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> 266 F.3d at 1230. Here, the OPM investigators are not IRS employees and are not supervised by the IRS Commissioner. In addition, the Commissioner has no authority to require them to comply with particular statutory provisions.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;There <span class="Italic">are</span> similarities between <span class="Italic">NASA</span> and this case. For example, the level of cooperation between OPM investigators, who conduct the suitability investigations of covered appointees, and the IRS, which initiates the investigations and makes suitability determinations for at least covered appointees, mirrors the cooperation between OIG investigators and NASA that the Supreme Court found significant in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>. Specifically, the Supreme <span id="Page_1445"></span>Court noted that "limitations on OIG authority [to sanction NASA employees] enhance the likelihood and importance of cooperation between the agency and its OIG." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 242; <span class="Italic">see Dep't of Justice</span>, 266 F.3d at 1231 ("[I]t was the likelihood of...cooperation [by OIG and agency management] that the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court saw as militating in favor of treating OIG interrogators as 'representatives of the agency.'"). On the other hand, the OIG's lack of authority to sanction employees under investigation is another reason to distinguish <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, as OPM investigators have independent authority to sanction employees for failing to cooperate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g) (OPM retains jurisdiction over "all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony"). There are often multiple reasonable interpretations of a statute but <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> requires that we defer to the agency's selection. <span class="Italic">See Riverkeeper, Inc</span>., 556 U.S. at 218; <span class="Italic">Am. Forest &#x0026; Paper Ass'n</span>, 550 F.3d at 1183.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we easily reject the Union's claim that the Authority's interpretation of section 7114 enables the IRS to evade covered appointees' <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights through outsourcing.[8] Because it is OPM that ultimately decides who conducts suitability investigations and, hence, suitability interviews of covered appointees, there can be no claim that the Authority's interpretation of "representative" will encourage the IRS to outsource suitability interviews of covered appointees--the investigative authority is simply not the IRS's to delegate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104; <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 736.201(a),(b); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 5.2(a). In fact, we think the Authority's interpretation more than adequately addresses any potential outsourcing concerns by ensuring that outside investigators hired to perform agency functions and operating under agency control would nonetheless be considered "representatives" of the agency under section 7114(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The Union mistakenly argues that the Supreme Court's interpretation of "representative" in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> is premised on the Court's concern that a narrow reading would encourage an agency to outsource investigations. The portion of <span class="Italic">NASA</span> cited by the Union manifests that it was the <span class="Italic">Authority</span>, not the Court, that was concerned with outsourcing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 527 U.S. at 234 ("The Authority reasoned that adopting their proposal might erode the right by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit....").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are also unconvinced that the Authority's interpretation is unreasonable merely because union participation is not as robust as a broader reading of section 7114 would allow. Although it is true that the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court recognized the potential benefits of union participation in the OIG investigatory process, OPM believes "the presence of a third party during a subject interview serves as a potential distraction, reduces the usefulness of the subject interview, and thus reduces the ability of the investigation to get to the most complete and accurate results." Given OPM's view, the line drawn by the Authority in interpreting the Statute does not unreasonably restrict union participation in contravention of congressional intent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that the Authority's interpretation of "representative of the agency" is reasonable, we must decide whether the Authority's determination that OPM investigators do not perform an IRS function or operate under IRS control during interviews of covered IRS appointees was "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2343</span>, 144 F.3d at 88 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In challenging the Authority's application of the function and control standard, the Union argues that, because the IRS has the authority delegated from OPM to perform suitability <span class="Italic">determinations</span> of covered appointees, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a), the <span class="Italic">investigation</span> of them (which includes the interview) is also an IRS function. According to the Union, "OPM investigators act as representatives of IRS by performing a function necessary for IRS to make suitability determinations that it is obligated to make." NTEU also argues that "OPM investigators are simply acting under IRS control by facilitating IRS's suitability determinations of appointees." To support its claim that the IRS controls the investigation of covered appointees, the Union points to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the following evidence: (1) the IRS tells personnel the suitability investigation is "management's tool for evaluating their character," (2) interviews are held in IRS offices during work time, (3) individuals must receive permission from IRS supervisors before attending the interviews, (4) the IRS requires individuals to attend the interviews and can discipline them if they fail to cooperate and (5) OPM investigators turn over completed investigation files to the IRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is plain, however, that OPM investigators do not perform an IRS function or operate under IRS control during suitability interviews of covered IRS appointees. First, there is little question that the <span class="Italic">investigation</span> of covered appointees is an OPM function as the regulatory scheme expressly entrusts to OPM the role of conducting suitability investigations of covered personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(a); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 736.201(a),(b); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 5.2(a). Indeed, this case is different from other FLRA cases that use the function and control test. In those cases, the Authority concluded that outside contractors were representatives of an agency because they were "performing a function that otherwise would have been performed by the [agency]." <span class="Italic">PBGC</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. at 224; <span class="Italic">see also SSA</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. at 880 (contractor is agency representative where function being performed is one agency "had an official obligation" to perform). Here, it is OPM's "official obligation" to investigate covered personnel. <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. at 880.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, it is clear that the IRS does not exercise control over OPM investigators during suitability interviews. The arbitrator determined that there was "no basis or authority for [the] IRS to tell OPM how its investigators should go about conducting their investigatory interviews," and that the IRS could not alter OPM's decision to not "permit [U]nion representatives to participate in" the interviews. The Union did not challenge these determinations before the Authority, nor could it, as no statute or regulation permits the IRS to intrude upon an OPM investigation. Thus, although the Union is correct that the IRS has some role in the investigatory process, we conclude, consistent with the arbitrator's uncontested determinations, that the IRS does not control OPM investigators during suitability investigations of covered personnel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That the IRS has limited authority to make suitability <span class="Italic">determinations</span> for covered appointees does not, as NTEU argues, lead to a different result. The Union's claim that the investigation of covered appointees is an IRS function is based on the notion that, because the IRS makes the suitability determination, the suitability investigation is performed <span class="Italic">for</span> the IRS. But the limited nature of OPM's delegation to the IRS to make suitability determinations for covered appointees belies the notion that making suitability determinations is really an IRS prerogative and that investigations are done for the IRS. Among other limits on the IRS's authority, the agency must adhere to OPM policies and standards in making suitability determinations or risk revocation of the delegation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(c),(f); OPM oversees the IRS's exercise of its authority to make suitability determinations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(b)(2); OPM retains jurisdiction of a case "where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment" and of a case "involving a refusal to furnish testimony," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g); the IRS must refer cases to OPM when "Governmentwide debarment by OPM...may be an appropriate action," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.103(b); and OPM "may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction...in any case it deems necessary," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.103(g). We are unconvinced that OPM has in any way ceded to the IRS the separate and distinct function of conducting a suitability <span class="Italic">investigation</span>--which it has not delegated to the IRS since 2008--by granting the IRS such limited authority to make a suitability <span class="Italic">determination</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we conclude that the Authority reasonably construed the "representative of the agency" language in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to support a function and control analysis in determining its applicability <span class="Italic">vel non, see Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 414 F.3d at 57 (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43), and that the Authority's application of its interpretation to OPM-conducted suitability interviews of covered IRS personnel is not "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2343</span>, 144 F.3d at 88 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A)). Accordingly, we deny NTEU's petition for review.</p>
