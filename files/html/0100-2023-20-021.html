<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-21"><span class="space">i.</span> Communication Indirectly Involving the Government; Private Wrongdoing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Broadly stated, whistleblower protection provided by the law is for individuals who report government misconduct or misconduct by officials within the government. The law does not extend to reports of private misbehavior. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. DHUD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3334) (whistleblower protection did not extend to a report to a federal official that "'the Crypt Gang' and 'the Mob' were harassing and threatening both [appellant] and her family, including when she was at work.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 529, 532-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 166 (2002)), communications may be protected even if they do not directly implicate government personnel but "the government's interests and good name are implicated in the alleged wrongdoing at issue, and when the appellant shows that she reasonably believed that the information she disclosed evidenced that wrongdoing":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant had made oral statements to a congressional aide, sometime before January 5, 1997, in which she disclosed information she reasonably believed evidenced a violation of law, i.e., information she reasonably believed constituted evidence that a group known as Hermandad Mexicana Nacional was violating state voter registration laws by filling out voter registration cards for persons who were not United States citizens. He also found that she had made similar statements in a document that was dated January 5, 1997; that a former union official, James Humble Sanchez, had transmitted that document to another congressional aide sometime between that date and January 16, 1997; that the appellant reasonably believed that statements in that document also evidenced a violation of state voter registration laws; and that both the written disclosures and the oral disclosures therefore were protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted in his analysis of this matter that Hermandad Mexicana Nacional was a private organization, rather than a part of the federal government, and that decisions of our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, had indicated that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was intended to protect disclosures of "government wrongdoing." ID at 11-13 (citing <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998)) (the "purpose of the [Whistleblower Protection Act] is to encourage government personnel to disclose government wrongdoing..."), and <span class="Italic">Lachance v.</span> <span class="Italic">White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (test for determining whether disclosure is protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) is whether "a disinterested observer...[could] reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence" a kind of wrongdoing covered in that provision), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1157, 145 L. Ed.2d 1069 (2000). He concluded, however, that the appellant's disclosures were covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because (1) the essence of those disclosures was that the government program under which the private organization was operating was being used to facilitate wrongdoing, (2) if this alleged wrongdoing were allowed to continue, the agency could be viewed as an accessory to the wrongdoing, and (3) the government's interests and reputation therefore were implicated in the alleged wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur in the administrative judge's analysis of this matter. When the government's interests and good name are implicated in the alleged wrongdoing at issue, and when the appellant shows that she reasonably believed that the information she disclosed evidenced that wrongdoing, the disclosure is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In the present case, it is undisputed that Hermandad Mexicana Nacional performed functions within the scope of the agency's overall responsibilities, i.e., functions related to the agency's Citizenship USA (CUSA) program; the agency accordingly was in a position to influence or exercise oversight over that organization's performance of those functions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Appeal File, Tab 1, Ex. A at 1 (appellant's description of alleged wrongdoing, describing private organization as an "outreach agenc[y]" and alleging that agency official allow[ed] and encourag[ed] the practice" in question).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;To the extent prior decisions of the Board have held or implied that allegations of wrongdoing by persons not employed by the government can never be protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), those decisions are overruled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Coons v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Oram argues that the Board narrowly construed 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) to cover only violations committed by federal employees. But "[t]he purpose of the [Whistleblower Protection Act] is to encourage government personnel to disclose government wrongdoing." <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998). And the amendments that Congress made in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act do not "extend whistleblower protection to claims involving purely private conduct," like Mr. Oram's termination from his previous position in the UAE [United Arab Emirates]. <span class="Italic">See Aviles v. MSPB</span>, 799 F.3d 457, 464 (5th Cir. 2015).

Therefore, the Board did not err in determining that Mr. Oram's disclosure is not protected because he did not allege that a government official committed wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Disclosures of wrongdoing by a nongovernment entity may constitute protected disclosures when the government's interests and good name are implicated in the alleged wrongdoing, and the employee shows that he reasonably believed that the information he disclosed evidenced that wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Arauz</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529 &#x00B6; 7. The AJ found that, "[w]hile Arizona DPS and Customs had a joint task force of agents responsible for investigating the auto theft ring and some Customs agents were on the scene, <span class="Italic">it is undisputed that Arizona DPS was solely responsible for executing the search warrant</span> at Alkhabbaz's residence." She therefore found that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure of alleged misconduct by state officials (i.e., the Arizona DPS) implicated the federal government's interests and good name, as required by<span class="Italic"> Arauz</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529 &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's summary of the facts with regard to the execution of the warrant is not supported by the record. In an affidavit, Special Agent in Charge (SAIC) Steve Minas stated that "agents from the SAIC/Tuscon [i.e., Customs agents] <span class="Italic">and</span> Arizona [DPS] executed a <span class="Italic">federal</span> search warrant on the residence of...Alkhabbaz...." An Internal Affairs report set forth a September 30, 2002 memorandum from the SAIC that stated that a "<span class="Italic">federal</span> search warrant" was jointly executed by Customs and the Arizona DPS. In the motion to dismiss, the agency's representative stated that the Arizona DPS "<span class="Italic">along with federal agents</span> from the [SAIC] ...executed a search warrant" on Alkhabbaz's residence. In addition, on PFR, the agency representative reasserts that the Arizona DPS "<span class="Italic">along with</span>...(SAIC)/Tucson, executed a search warrant," and states that the alleged misconduct occurred "during the<span class="Italic"> joint operation</span> of a service of a warrant." Thus, contrary to the AJ's finding, we find that the agency and the Arizona DPS jointly executed the search warrant on Alkhabbaz's residence. Therefore, we find that the Arizona DPS's alleged use of excessive force during the joint execution of the search warrant with Customs implicated the government's interests and good name. <span class="Italic">Cf. Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 38 &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (the appellant's disclosures that agency officials ignored contract violations and irregularities that cost the government thousands of dollars, and also ignored a contractor's hiring of undocumented aliens, implicated the government's interests and reputation); <span class="Italic">Arauz</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529 &#x00B6; 7 &#x0026; n.1 (the government's interests and good name were implicated where the private organization performed functions related to the agency's outreach program and the agency was in a position to influence or exercise oversight over the organization's performance of those functions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tello v. DHS,</span> DA-1221-10-0137-W-1 (NP 7/18/2011), determined that a protected disclosure included a report to the Justice Department and to the President that federal law enforcement officials violated state law through an assault on a private citizen:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that his letter to the Department of Justice was a protected disclosure. If a sexual assault was committed under "color of law," as alleged by the appellant in his April 28, 2009 letter, such action would constitute a violation of law. Indeed, the appellant cited specific provisions of the Texas Penal Code that he believed were violated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge reasoned, however, that the allegation that "men possibly pretending to be Federal Agents on State property" had committed a sexual assault does not provide facts that a disinterested observer could reasonably conclude described actions of the government. It is, in fact, government wrongdoing that the WPA encourages government personnel to disclose. <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1998). However, the Board has found that, when the government's interests and good name are implicated in the alleged wrongdoing, and when the appellant shows that he reasonably believed that the information disclosed evidenced that wrongdoing, the disclosure is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2005) (disclosure regarding alleged wrongdoing of state government officials was protected because the state and federal agencies were engaged in a joint operation, and the alleged misconduct by the state employees as part of that joint operation implicated the federal government's interests and good name); <span class="Italic">Arauz v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (disclosure regarding alleged wrongdoing by a private organization was protected when the agency was in a position to influence or exercise oversight over the organization's performance of a federal agency's responsibilities).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, at the time the appellant made this disclosure, it was his understanding, based on what the woman in question related to him, that, on April 16, 2009, she was summoned to a state government building in connection with an investigation concerning possible welfare fraud; that, when she left the building, she was followed; and that she was subsequently forced into a van and detained for several hours during which time she was questioned further about the alleged welfare fraud, threatened with deportation, and sexually assaulted. The appellant was also aware that the woman had contacted the police department about the incident and that an investigation had been opened. In addition, he knew that, when he was interviewed several days later by Office of Internal Affairs investigators, the interview focused on the same allegations of welfare fraud as those that were discussed with the woman, and that some of the same questions were asked. Under these circumstances, the interests and good name of the federal government are clearly implicated. We find that a disinterested observer with knowledge of these essential facts could reasonably conclude that the woman was detained and assaulted by government officials, and that one or more of the officials who later questioned the appellant participated in her detention and assault, and we therefore find that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that his letter to the Department of Justice constituted a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Drake v. Agency for International Development</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 11 (2006) (any doubt or ambiguity as to whether the appellant has made nonfrivolous allegations should be resolved in favor of finding jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A dissent by Vice Chairman Wagner explored how a government interest may have been involved in the appellant's report to her agency of alleged misconduct by a private sector entity in <span class="Italic">Aviles v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, DA-1221-13-0518-W-1 (NP 7/14/2014), but on appeal tho the Fifth Circuit, her argument did not gain sufficient traction for the court to overturn the Board's jurisdictional dismissal, <span class="Italic">Aviles v. MSPB</span>, 799 F.3d 457, 463-66 (5th Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles argues (a) that Congress's recent amendment of the Whistleblower Protection Act expanded the scope of protected disclosures to include disclosures of purely private wrongdoing and (b) that even if only disclosures of government misconduct are protected, he non-frivolously alleged that IRS officials were complicit in Exxon's alleged tax fraud. We address each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reports of Purely Private Wrongdoing as Protected Disclosures</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles's argument raises an initial issue of statutory interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. As amended, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) prohibits adverse personnel actions based on:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Through the WPEA, Congress added subsection 2302(f)(2), which provides: "If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8)...." &#x00A7; 101, 126 Stat. at 1465-66. The dissenting Vice Chairman reasoned from this addition that, "as a matter of plain logic," "when the federal employee's normal course of duties includes regulating, monitoring, or investigating private entities, a disclosure about alleged wrongdoing by the private entity falls squarely within the WPEA's coverage."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3662"></span>Aviles relies on Vice Chairman Wagner's dissent from the Board's decision and argues that Congress extended whistleblower protection through the WPEA to include disclosures of "wrongdoing by private entities made by federal employees." Specifically, Aviles points to the Senate Committee Report for the 2012 amendment, which states that subsection 2302(f)(2) "overturns...court decisions that narrowed the scope of protected disclosures," including <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998), a decision the Board relied on. S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5 (2012). Accordingly, Aviles argues that his disclosure that Exxon "inflated its foreign income sales and fraudulently added supplemental tax data in order to reduce its overall tax liability by over $500 million" was protected, and that he was "subjected to numerous [adverse] personnel actions, including...ultimately removal" as a result of his protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Treasury Department counters that the "plain language of section 2302(b)(8)...requires that a disclosure must evidence Government misconduct to be eligible for whistleblower protection." Treasury interprets the legislative history of the 2012 amendments differently from Aviles and the dissent. Although the WPEA did seek to overturn several Federal Circuit decisions that had narrowed the scope of protected disclosures, Treasury argues that Congress's decision to overturn these decisions did not silently extend whistleblower protection to claims involving purely private conduct. Rather, Treasury concludes that the legislative history and statutory text reflect "Congress's intention to protect disclosures of <span class="Italic">Government</span> misconduct." The MSPB largely echoes these points, but also adds that, "because &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) is silent on the issue of whether private misconduct...constitutes a basis for a protected disclosure, this Court should defer to the Board's reasonable interpretation of the statute" under the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> doctrine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Treasury and the MSPB that Congress did not intend to protect disclosures of purely private wrongdoing when it enacted the WPEA. Applying traditional principles of statutory interpretation--without deciding what deference, if any, should be afforded the Board's unpublished interpretation of the amended statute--we reject Aviles's interpretation of the statute to include purely private wrongdoing. The text indicates that the focus of the statute is government wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (protecting disclosures of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, [or] an abuse of authority"). Nothing in the text of the WPEA purports to <span class="Italic">extend</span> subsection (b)(8) to extra categories of disclosures; the language simply clarifies that otherwise-covered disclosures are not <span class="Italic">excluded</span> merely because they are made during an employee's normal duties. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) ("If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the disclosure <span class="Italic">shall not be excluded</span> from subsection (b)(8)...." (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles's proposed interpretation is also at odds with common sense and principles of statutory interpretation. His interpretation could turn every enforcement disagreement between a subordinate and a supervisor at the IRS, FBI, Department of Justice, or other federal agency into a potential protected disclosure and an eventual whistleblower claim down the road. After all, many federal agency employees make enforcement decisions concerning private persons "during the normal course of [their] duties," <span class="Italic">id</span>., on a day-to-day basis in dialogue with their supervisors. If Congress intended such a significant intrusion into the settled law governing federal employment relationships, we believe it would have spoken more clearly. This comports with principles of statutory interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Barbee v. United States</span>, 392 F.2d 532, 535 n.4 (5th Cir. 1968) ("A change of phraseology in a revision will not be regarded as altering the law where it had been settled by plain language in the statutes, or by judicial construction thereof, unless it is clear that such was the intent." (quoting <span class="Italic">McDonald v. Hovey</span>, 110 U.S. 619, 629 (1884))); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. Antonin Scalia &#x0026; Bryan A. Garner, <span class="Italic">Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts</span> 318-19 (2012) ("The better view is that statutes will not be interpreted as changing the common law unless they effect the change with clarity.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we conclude that the text of the amended statute after application of ordinary principles of statutory interpretation supports the Board's interpretation, we need not and do not rely on the legislative history. <span class="Italic">See Carrieri v. Jobs.com Inc</span>., 393 F.3d 508, 518-19 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Kay</span>, 359 F.3d 738, 743 (5th Cir. 2004)).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Although our interpretation follows from the text applying ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, we express no view on whether the text is "unambiguous" and "thus leaves no room for agency discretion" within the meaning of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">National Cable &#x0026; Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services</span>, 545 U.S. 967, 982 (2005)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles's legislative-history argument is also unavailing because it is contrary to the text of the amendment. Aviles points to a Senate committee report and contends that the report is evidence that the WPEA overturns the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, an opinion that the administrative judge expressly relied on.[9] Aviles proposes that, therefore, by overturning <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, Congress extended protection to disclosures of purely private wrongdoing. The disclosure in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> did concern private wrongdoing: the petitioner complained about his supervisors' decision "reversing [his] determination that the [private] farms failed to comply with USDA conservation plans," 141 F.3d at 1141, and the court held that his disclosures to his immediate supervisors were not protected, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1143.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 5 &#x0026; n.13 ("Section 101 of S. 743 overturns...<span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, [in which] the court stated that a disclosure made as part of an employee's normal job duties is not protected.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But the text of the WPEA does not mention disclosures of purely private wrongdoing; if anything, the text added by the amendment reflects Congress's concern that language in the <span class="Italic">Willis</span> decision could be interpreted as categorically <span class="Italic">excluding</span> otherwise-protected disclosures from protection if those disclosures are made <span class="Italic">in the ordinary course of a federal employee's job duties. See</span> &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2). In rejecting the petitioner's proposed blanket rule in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> that the WPA entitled federal employees "to assert that the required performance of their day-to-day responsibilities" <span class="Italic">per se</span> "constitute[s] a protected disclosure," the Federal Circuit suggested that disclosures in the normal course of duties are not protected, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1144. The text added by the WPEA provides that "a disclosure...made during the normal course of duties of an employee...<span class="Italic">shall not be excluded</span> from [protection under] subsection (b)(8)" solely for that reason, &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) (emphasis added), and says nothing about private malfeasance. Thus, Aviles's argument is unavailing because it does not find support in the text of the amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we agree with the Board's conclusion that allegations of purely private wrongdoing are not protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aviles</span> distinguished the situation of government complicity in private wrongdoing, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 466-67:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue in this appeal is whether Aviles "nonfrivolously" alleged a protected disclosure within the meaning of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As discussed above, allegations of purely private wrongdoing are not protected under the WPA as amended by the WPEA. But if the disclosure includes allegations of government complicity in the private wrongdoing, then the disclosure may be protected. Thus, the question is whether Aviles nonfrivolously alleged that IRS officials were complicit in Exxon's alleged tax fraud.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Coons v. Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury</span> is instructive. 383 F.3d 879 (9th Cir. 2004). There, Coons argued he was demoted in retaliation for making protected disclosures--namely, that undisclosed IRS agents illegally shared confidential information with a taxpayer's lawyer and that IRS agents knowingly manually processed a large fraudulent refund for that taxpayer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 888-90. The Ninth Circuit reversed the Board's decision dismissing Coons's whistleblower claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 891. It held that Coons's claim that IRS officials, "whose mission is to collect taxes, improperly processed a large, fraudulent refund for a wealthy taxpayer is an allegation of 'gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, [or] an abuse of authority.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (alteration in original) (quoting &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles argues that he nonfrivolously alleged that his supervisors "allowed or facilitated wrongful conduct by a private organization," Exxon. In response to the Board's conclusion that his allegations were too "vague and conclusory" and lacking in the requisite specificity to be deemed "nonfrivolous," Aviles argues that he alleged that his supervisors "ignored his disclosures of Exxon's alleged tax fraud" and "directed him not to divulge Exxon's actions." Aviles also points to his allegation that "the [IRS management] team covered up the fraud." Aviles's argument relies heavily on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Coons</span>. In reply, Aviles also points to a precedential decision from the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 259 (2013), and argues that the allegations in <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span> "are almost identical to" his, in that "the appellant in <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span>...[alleged] fraudulent submittals by the state of Wisconsin, [and] that '[Justice Department] officials were covering it up.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB and Treasury counter that the Board correctly concluded that Aviles's "generalized assertions" of government involvement in Exxon's fraud "do not constitute a non-frivolous allegation of a protected disclosure." They point out that the petitioner's allegations in <span class="Italic">Coons</span> "were detailed and specific, including: that a former Regional Counsel for the IRS was using his influence to corrupt the IRS's collection of taxes from a taxpayer," and that Aviles's "vague allegations of a 'cover up'" without more "do not rise to this level." Treasury adds that, "even after the administrative judge gave Mr. Aviles multiple opportunities to explain his disclosure [that the IRS management team helped to cover up Exxon's alleged tax fraud] in further detail, Mr. Aviles failed to do so."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board's decision dismissing Aviles's appeal and deny Aviles's petition for review. Unlike Aviles's vague and conclusory allegations of a "cover up," the allegations in the <span class="Italic">Coons</span> case specifically implicated particular government officials. The Ninth Circuit noted that the petitioner's disclosures included his "concern that [a taxpayer's] <span id="Page_3663"></span>attorney was using his influence [as a former Regional Counsel for the IRS] to corrupt <span class="Italic">the IRS's</span> collection of taxes" from that taxpayer, and that "current IRS staff were sharing information illegally" with that taxpayer's attorney. 383 F.3d at 889. The petitioner in Coons also disclosed that IRS officials "improperly processed a large, fraudulent refund for a wealthy taxpayer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 890. In contrast, here, Aviles made no specific allegations of wrongdoing by government officials. Even on appeal, Aviles does not explain in his brief to this Court the necessary "who, what, when, where, and how" of government involvement in the alleged cover-up of Exxon's tax fraud. <span class="Italic">See United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Tex. Inc</span>., 336 F.3d 375, 387-88 (5th Cir. 2003) (affirming denial of leave to amend a complaint in part because "there is no indication in Willard's briefs to this court that he will be able to allege the necessary 'who, what, when, where, and how' of the alleged fraud"). We also note that the ALJ gave Aviles multiple opportunities to amend his IRA complaint and provide additional factual content before finally dismissing his administrative appeal. <span class="Italic">See Foman v. Davis</span>, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (noting that "repeated failure to cure deficiencies [in a complaint] by amendments previously allowed" may be grounds for dismissal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Aviles's reliance on the Board's precedential decision in <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span> is misplaced, and the distinctions between this case and <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span> illustrate why Aviles's appeal was properly dismissed by the Board. Aviles takes one statement from the <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span> opinion--the petitioner's allegation that "the state of Wisconsin submitted fraudulent data...and agency managers <span class="Italic">were covering it up</span>," 120 M.S.P.R. at 270 (emphasis added)--out of context. This allegation alone would be insufficient to establish the Board's jurisdiction; in <span class="Italic">Rumsey</span>, there was significant additional evidence of federal government wrongdoing from congressional oversight hearings and news coverage, including that the agency administrator had "awarded grants" for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention to "lower-scoring organizations" despite the administrator's staff's recommendations to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 264. Indeed, the ALJ in that case denied the petition on the merits, finding that the petitioner's "disclosures to ABC News and Congress were not protected because...[that] information...was already publicly known" and because those disclosures"occurred in the normal course of the performance of her duties"--not because there were no allegations or evidence of government wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 265, 270.</p>

The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Arauz</span> because that decision was issued before the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), which reversed some judicially created limitations on whistleblower protections.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Aviles</span>, 799 F.3d at 464-66, which was decided after enactment of the WPEA, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (Fifth Circuit) agreed with the Board and held that, when enacting the WPEA, "Congress did not intend to protect disclosures of purely private wrongdoing." As the appellant notes, <span class="Italic">Aviles</span> is not necessarily binding on the Board. Prior to late 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) generally was the Board's sole reviewing court in cases of alleged whistleblower reprisal. <span class="Italic">Chambers v.

However, since that time, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7703(b)(1)(B), an appellant who seeks review of a final Board decision and limits any prohibited personnel practice claims to those arising under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and (b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D) may seek review in any Federal circuit court of appeal of competent jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Chambers</span>, 2022 MSPB 8, &#x00B6; 10 n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Yet the appellant has pointed to no other circuit which has held contrary to the Board's precedent in <span class="Italic">Arauz</span>. The Federal Circuit recently had the opportunity to do so, but in a nonprecedential decision instead agreed that disclosures of purely private wrongdoing are not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and in fact cited <span class="Italic">Aviles</span> in its decision. <span class="Italic">Oram v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2021-2307, 2022 WL 866327 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 23, 2022).5 In the absence of any higher authority rejecting the Board's position in <span class="Italic">Arauz</span>, we decline to revisit it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant made disclosures regarding alleged wrongdoing by the Navajo Nation Forestry Department that implicated the Federal Government's interests and good name</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now consider whether the Government's interests and good name were implicated in the alleged wrongdoing. In <span class="Italic">Arauz</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, the Board found that the Government's interests and good name were implicated in a disclosure of a non-Governmental organization's alleged violation of state voter registration laws because the organization was performing functions within the scope of a Government program and the agency was in a position to influence or exercise oversight over the organization's performance of those functions. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2002), the Board found that the Government's interests and reputation were implicated by the appellant's disclosure of alleged contract violations and illegal employment practices by a Government contractor because the appellant claimed that agency officials ignored the contractor's conduct. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13, the Board found that the Federal Government's interests and good name were implicated by an appellant's disclosure that state officials allegedly used excessive force because the alleged wrongdoing occurred during the joint execution of a search warrant by those officials and the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this guidance, we consider the appellant's December 2013 and September 2014 disclosures in turn. As explained below, we conclude that the appellant's disclosures concerned purported wrongdoing by the Navajo Nation that implicated the Federal Government's interests, reputation, and good name.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's December 5, 2013 disclosures implicated the Federal Government's interests and good name.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge acknowledged that allegations of private wrongdoing may constitute protected whistleblowing, citing the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Arauz</span> and the Fifth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Aviles</span>, but determined that the December 5, 2013 memoranda regarding the Navajo Nation Forestry Department's securing of a timber harvesting permit were not protected because the appellant had not explained why she believed that agency personnel were violating rules or abusing authority, or made specific allegations of wrongdoing by agency officials. Instead, the administrative judge characterized the memoranda as expressing concerns about the Navajo Nation's conduct. Consequently, he concluded that the appellant failed to show by preponderant evidence that she reasonably believed that she was disclosing any wrongdoing by agency personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that she reasonably believed the project along Highway 264 was covered by a 638 contract, and thus subject to the statutes and regulations concerning such projects. We find that the appellant's December 2013 disclosures are protected because they implicate the Government's good name.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1868, the United States and the Navajo Tribe entered into an agreement that established a reservation covering, as relevant here, the area around Fort Defiance that was the subject of the appellant's disclosures. Treaty Between the United States and the Navajo Tribe of Indians, <span class="Italic">ratified</span> July 25, 1868, 15 Stat. 667 (the Treaty of 1868); <span class="Italic">see McClanahan v. State Tax Commission of Arizona</span>, 411 U.S. 164, 173-75 (1973) (explaining that the Treaty of 1868 set aside a reservation for the Navajo "under general [F]ederal supervision"). The Federal Government, acting through the agency, generally manages and has pervasive control over Indian timber, land, and forests on reservation land. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 207-09, 219-23 (1983) (discussing this control in the context of the Government's 1861 treaty with the Quinault and Quileute Tribes, citing, among other authorities, 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 405-407, 466; 25 C.F.R. part 163). Similarly, the agency has authority to grant rights-of-way through reservation lands with Tribal or individual owner consent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 223 (citing 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 323-25; 25 C.F.R. part 169). This control creates a trust relationship and resulting fiduciary obligation on the part of the Government toward the Indian people as to the Government's "management and operation" of these reservation resources. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 224-26; <span class="Italic">see Navajo Nation v. U.S. Department of the Interior</span>, 26 F.4th 794, 800, 809-12 (9th Cir. 2022) (finding that, under the Treaty of 1868, the United States had an implied trust obligation toward the Navajo Nation as it concerns its rights to access water from the Colorado River, which is "appurtenant to the Nation"), <span class="Italic">cert. granted</span>, 143 S. Ct. 398 (2022) (No. 22-51).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant believed that the timber harvested along Highway 264 was subject to a 638 contract, she was mistaken. Instead, the area in question was subject to a right-of-way, which gave ADOT the <span id="Page_3664"></span>right to remove the trees. As discussed above, the agency has a fiduciary duty concerning the assets on the reservation land generally and the authority to award rights-of-way, such as the right-of-way that the agency provided to ADOT along Highway 264. <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. at 223-26; e.g., 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 311, 323-35; 25 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 169.5-169.6. Accordingly, the appellant's questioning of the activities along Highway 264 and her suggestion that the Navajo Nation Forestry Department had a conflict of interest in obtaining the timber from those activities implicated the agency's reputation in its oversight of Indian resources and land. <span class="Italic">See Arauz</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evaluating an adverse action whistleblowing defense,<span class="Italic"> Voorhis v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 538, 551 &#x00B6; 30, 2011 MSPB 67 (2011), rejected application of <span class="Italic">Arauz</span> to charges of improper disclosure of information from a government database for the purpose correcting allegedly improper representations being made in a state political campaign involving a candidate who was a local district attorney:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Arauz v. Department of Justice,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 529 (2001), the appellant asserts that his disclosures regarding the Denver DA's practice of plea bargaining with criminal aliens implicated the reputation and good name of the federal government because Mr. Ritter alleged in the August 23, 2006 newspaper article that the federal government, rather than his office, was responsible for releasing illegal aliens. The instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Arauz,</span> and we therefore discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's disclosures were not protected. First, unlike the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Arauz,</span> the Denver DA's office is not a private organization operating under a federal program and there is no evidence that the DA's office was using a federal program to facilitate wrongdoing. Rather, the Denver DA's office is a city entity with independent prosecutorial power and policy making authority. The agency may disagree with the office's exercise of its prosecutorial power, and, indeed, the office's exercise of its prosecutorial power could indirectly implicate the agency's reputation, but only for those who lack understanding regarding the limits of the agency's powers. Moreover, it is difficult to see how the agency could be viewed as an accessory to the decisions or actions of the Denver DA's office based solely on the plea-bargaining policy disclosed by the appellant. Additionally, the appellant has failed to show that a disinterested observer could reasonably conclude that the Denver DA's plea-bargaining policy actually evidenced wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Accordingly, we concur with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's disclosures did not implicate the reputation and good name of the federal government and thus are not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Kennington v. Dept. of Treasury,</span> DE-1221-10-0502-W-1 (NP 5/24/2011) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Kennington v. MSPB</span>, 456 Fed. Appx. 899 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), no governmental interest was implicated by the appellant's disclosures concerning a private entity's actions that did not involve the government:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the initial decision did not apply the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) correctly. He reiterates that he gave the agency's Criminal Investigation unit information on money laundering, tax evasion, and fraud being committed against the government; that he explained to his acting manager that he felt increased harassment because of those disclosures; that, although the administrative judge found that they did not constitute a violation of law, he is considered a federal whistleblower; and that he was terminated. He argues that the term "any disclosure" in the WPA includes disclosures of fraud being committed against the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that a disclosure concerning a private entity's alleged malfeasance was not protected under the WPA because it was not a disclosure about government action may have been too broad. The Board has held that disclosures of wrongdoing by a non-governmental entity may constitute protected disclosures when the government's interests and good name are implicated in the alleged wrongdoing and the employee shows that he reasonably believed that the information he disclosed evidenced that wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 12 (2005); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 38, &#x00B6; 10 (2002); <span class="Italic">Arauz v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001). Here, however, the appellant's disclosures did not implicate the government's interests and good name because he has not alleged that the government was involved in any way in the private entities' alleged wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ivey v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 11 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 107 F. App'x 918 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Thus, any oversimplification of the standard by the administrative judge did not prejudice the appellant's rights, and therefore does not provide a basis for reversing the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Kennington v. MSPB</span>, 456 Fed. Appx. 899, 902 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kennington maintains that his emails to the agency's criminal investigations unit were protected disclosures under the WPA. The Board held that those disclosures were not protected because they concerned private entities and did not involve any governmental conduct. The Board's ruling on that point is consistent with the language of the WPA and decisions by the Board applying the statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Voorhis v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 538, 551 (2011); <span class="Italic">Ivey v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 224, 229 (2003). The Board properly rejected Mr. Kennington's claim with regard to those disclosures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ivey v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 94 MSPR 224, 228-29 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (incidents involving unidentified individuals did not concern government employees, and the incidents did not implicate the government's interest and "good name"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ivey v.

<p class="Body-Text">Whistleblowers are protected who protest covered situations involving other agencies if their protest results in action against them by their employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Van Ee v. EPA</span>, 64 MSPR 693, 697 (1994) (EPA engineer reprimanded following his involvement as a private citizen in an environmental protest involving the Interior Department); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Greenup v.

<p class="Body-Text">Until it was overruled, <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 631, 640 &#x00B6; 16 (2000) (overruled on the point by <span class="Italic">Arauz v.

Dept. of Treasury,</span> SF-1221-99-0385-B-7 (NP 2/11/2011)), emphasized that protected whistleblowing involves disclosure or wrongdoing by government personnel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's disclosures regarding an alleged conflict of interest involving a former agency attorney, the appellant may have had a reasonable belief that the former employee who represented a taxpayer before the agency violated federal ethics laws. <span class="Italic">See</span> 18 USC &#x00A7; 207 (prohibiting former government employees from appearing before federal agencies in particular circumstances). Yet, even if the former employee violated these laws, he did so after he left the government's employ. Thus, although the appellant alleged that he disclosed this violation to the District Director and directed another agency employee to report it to the agency Inspector General, such disclosures were not protected by the WPA because they did not disclose abuses by government personnel<span class="Italic">. See Willis,</span> 141 F.3d at 1144 ("[t]he WPA is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good by disclosing abuses by <span class="Italic">government</span> personnel") (emphasis added).</p>
