<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-13"><span class="space">d.</span> Specific Oral Settlement Agreement Entered Into the Record</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the parties want a specific oral settlement, the Board allows the practice. The AJ errs by not accepting an oral settlement of an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction that the parties want to be made part of the record for purposes of enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 461, 462 (1994). Care must be taken to ensure that an oral settlement is properly recorded for the record. The parties to an appeal announced that they reached an oral settlement and represented to the AJ that they would reduce the agreement to writing and submit it into the record for enforcement. The written agreement did not arrive, but the AJ dismissed the case as settled anyway. When problems developed, the AJ said that the oral agreement was not enforceable. The Board disagreed and remanded the appeal "for a full recitation of the terms of the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes in keeping with the intent of the parties." <span class="Italic">Westfall v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 90, 93 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Care must be taken by the AJ not only to ensure that the appellant understands and agrees to the terms of a verbal settlement but also that the appellant's understanding is reflected in the Board's record when the verbal agreement is accepted by the AJ in resolution of the appeal. <span class="Italic">McCarter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 599, 602, 604 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 10, 2010 MSPB 181 (2010), noted, as the Board remanded when the appellant sought to reopen the case on PFR based on a challenge to the settlement and other problems:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record in this matter, however, does not reflect that the appellant understood the terms of the agreement or whether the parties agreed to enter the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. Therefore, we are remanding this matter for further adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's affirmative response to the administrative judge's question whether he agreed to "settle this case for payment of that amount under the terms of that agreement" is insufficient to show that he understood the terms of the agreement. Except for the amount to be paid, none of the other terms of the agreement were discussed on the record. Further, the appellant's assertion that he understood that "the case cannot proceed" because of a lack of evidence does not show that he understood that the pending dismissal was with prejudice or that such a dismissal was the end of his claim. Indeed, it is possible that the appellant believed that, if he obtained further evidence from DFAS or his agency, his appeal could then "proceed." Moreover, absolutely nothing in the record indicates that the appellant understood the breadth of the waivers contained in the agreement regarding this, or any other claims he had or may have had against the agency. Before dismissing an appeal as settled based on an oral agreement, as is the case with any settlement agreement, an administrative judge must sufficiently document for the record that the parties understood and agreed with the terms of the agreement settling the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Burton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 37, 39-40 (1990) (because the record did not document the terms of the parties' agreement, it failed to support the administrative judge's finding that the parties understood the agreement). Because the record does not adequately reflect the terms of the parties' agreement, or that the parties understood those terms, the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily, if the AJ learns that the parties have arrived at an oral settlement that they want in the record, the AJ will find a way to transcribe the settlement. If the appeal has not reached a hearing, the AJ will arrange for a prehearing telephonic conference and ask the parties to state the terms of the settlement as the AJ records those terms on a digital recorder. The audio record of the conference will then be the record of the oral settlement. If the recording is garbled, the Board may accept a party's undisputed version of the settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 89 MSPR 484, 486 n.1 (2001). If the appeal is already in a hearing, the AJ may ask the parties to state the terms of their settlement while the stenographer responsible for compiling the hearing record makes a transcript or recording of the settlement terms. Once the parties state the terms of the agreement to the AJ, and the AJ records those terms and confirms the parties' assent to the terms, as well as their desire to make the settlement a part of the record and a basis for dismissing the appeal, the AJ dismisses the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board became more specific about the audio or other recording of oral settlements in <span class="Italic">Robertson v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 512, 515-16 (1988), concluding that settlement should not be left to implication. At a minimum, measures must be taken to ensure that the parties agree with what the AJ believes constitutes a Board-enforceable oral settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n this case, there is no evidence of the settlement agreement which the administrative judge entered into the record. There is no written or record statement of the terms or provisions to which the parties agreed, except for the administrative judge's statements....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As detailed below, there are numerous satisfactory methods of preserving the terms of an oral settlement agreement, where the parties, as here, desire the agreement to be enforceable by the Board. Utilization of such procedures will serve to avoid the problems with lack of memorialization that have arisen in this case.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note, however, that where it is clear that the parties are not desirous of having the Board retain jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcement, it is appropriate to rely on oral settlement agreements, the terms of which have not been documented or specifically approved by the parties, as the basis for dismissal of the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the parties reach agreement at a prehearing conference or at the hearing, and the proceedings are tape recorded, the terms of the agreement should be recited by the parties and tape recorded for the record. Where tape recording is not available, the administrative judge may prepare, or have prepared, a verbatim transcript of the terms of the agreement. The terms should then be read to the parties to confirm their accuracy. In the alternative, a copy of the transcribed terms may be served on the parties with a reasonable time provided to dispute the description of the terms. Again, alternatively, a writing may be prepared summarizing the terms of an oral agreement. It is far preferable that written settlement summaries be prepared by the parties rather than by the administrative judge. In any event, the parties should be given the opportunity to document their consent to the written summary. Finally, the administrative judge may summarize the terms of the agreement on the record and then ask each party if the summary is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In future cases, in which the settlement agreement is reached after the date of this decision, where the record does not reveal whether the administrative judge read the terms of the agreement to the parties and obtained their consent, the Board will apply a rebuttable presumption that the administrative judge acted properly and did so.... [T]he Board will presume that the administrative judge accurately recorded the terms of the settlement agreement and obtained the consent of the parties before dismissing the appeal on the basis of the settlement agreement. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence showing that the administrative judge did not properly record the agreement or that the parties did not consent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because of the rebuttable presumption of the accuracy of the AJ's recordation of the terms of an oral agreement, if the oral agreement is placed into the record through a telephone conference with the AJ, it is essential that the parties agree about the accuracy of the record of that settlement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Durham v. TVA</span>, 42 MSPR 480, 486 (1989). The terms should be read, the parties should assent, and that should be the end of the matter; if there is discussion about the settlement as the agreement is read, one may find that the discussion becomes a part of or modifies an agreement in ways not intended by the parties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Baughman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 45 MSPR 580, 587 n.11 (1990). At the very least, there must be direct and affirmative evidence of the acceptance by each party of the terms of a settlement. Should the agency provide a statement of the parties' intentions, there must be evidence in the record showing the appellant's concurrence with those statements. <span class="Italic">Wilson, supra; Putnam, post</span>; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hassemer v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 72 MSPR 559, 562 (1996) (oral agreement was valid when the AJ made clear to the parties that their assent to an oral agreement would result in the dismissal of the appeal, the AJ provided the appellant with an opportunity to raise questions before closing the record on the settlement agreement, and the AJ informed the appellant that he could obtain a transcript of the conference in order to obtain a written copy of the terms of the settlement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ryan v. Dept. of Army</span>, CH-0752-16-0485-I-1 (NP 5/8/2023), rejected an argument that an oral settlement was invalid because the appellant did not agree with its terms when the oral settlement was reached:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant alleges that she did not voluntarily enter into the settlement agreement and that she was not in agreement with its terms on the date of the hearing. We find that these allegations fail to satisfy her heavy burden of establishing that the settlement agreement is invalid. <span class="Italic">See Tiburzi</span>, 269 F.3d at 1355 (finding that the appellant's unsubstantiated allegations of coercion were not sufficient to invalidate the oral settlement agreement). The record shows that, during the hearing, the appellant's representative agreed with the administrative judge's description of the terms of the agreement and did not offer an addition or correction when provided an opportunity to do so. <span class="Italic">See Pacilli v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 13 (stating that an appellant generally is responsible for the errors of her chosen representative), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 404 F. App'x 466 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Moreover, the appellant, who was present at the hearing, did not voice her objection to the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board suggested a more exacting approach toward oral settlements in <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls v. VA</span>, 115 MSPR 322, 325-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11, 2010 MSPB 238 (2010). The removal appeal was to have been resolved through a verbal settlement recorded during what was described in the decision as a "close of record" <span id="Page_4755"></span>telephone conference of March 3. The terms of the settlement were recited by the agency representative during the conference, and the AJ then asked the appellant if she had questions for the agency representative and whether she accepted the offer. The appellant said she had no questions and accepted the offer. The AJ concluded the conference by saying that she would place the recording into the file, that the appeal would be regarded as settled based on the stated terms, and that she would issue a short decision indicating that the appeal was dismissed as settled. That decision, issued on March 4, stated the AJ was satisfied that the agreement was lawful on its face, and freely reached by the parties, who understood its terms. The appeal was dismissed as settled. After the March 3 conference, the agency prepared a written settlement and sent it for signature to the appellant. On March 6, the appellant informed the AJ she would not sign the agreement because there was no provision for compensatory damages. She requested that her appeal be reopened. When the appeal reached the PFR stage, the agency argued that the appellant was attempting to repudiate an enforceable oral agreement. The Board decided that the appeal should be reopened because the AJ did not secure approval of the appellant to withdraw the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Oral settlement agreements are valid before the Board, and the same requirements apply to oral settlements as well as written settlements. <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). Absent a formal withdrawal of an appeal, however, and until the parties have agreed on the specific terms of the settlement agreement, the act of finality constituting a settlement has not occurred. <span class="Italic">Lee</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 3; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 132, 136 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted, after asking the agency representative to recite the terms of the agency's settlement offer, the administrative judge asked the appellant if she had any questions and whether she understood and accepted the agency's offer. Although the appellant answered that she accepted the agency's offer and had no questions, she never stated that she was withdrawing her Board appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant took actions shortly thereafter which suggest that she did not understand the oral agreement and its implications. As noted, in her March 6, 2010 letter, the appellant stated that, after reviewing the settlement agreement prepared by the agency, she had decided not to sign it and was moving forward with reopening/pursuing her Board appeal. Contrary to the agency representative's statements in her affidavit, the written agreement she sent to the appellant for her signature did not memorialize the terms of the agreement set forth during the telephone conference. Rather, the 6-page document imposed additional requirements upon the appellant, including that she withdraw discrimination complaints, grievances, and all other causes of action against the agency, and that she dismiss, release, forfeit and forever discharge the agency from any and all actions, before the MSPB, regarding any claim that was or could have been raised. Further, the written agreement stated that it superseded all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter of the appeal.<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, we find that the administrative judge dismissed the appeal with insufficient evidence of the parties' intent to enter into a settlement agreement. The oral agreement did not contain a provision stating that the appellant would withdraw her appeal, and it does not appear that she believed she had done so or that she otherwise understood the terms of the agreement. Nor did the oral agreement, as described by the agency representative during the telephone conference, indicate that the parties wished for it to be included in the record for enforcement purposes, even though the administrative judge stated in the initial decision that the agreement was enforceable by the Board. In sum, although an oral agreement is valid in Board proceedings, <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 11, in light of the record evidence in this case, we find that there is insufficient evidence to find that a settlement of any type was reached between these parties.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit explained in <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. DOJ</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001), that if the parties enter what they intend to be a binding oral settlement, that settlement controls even if the parties cannot or do not agree on the subsequent written memorialization of its terms:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is "axiomatic that a settlement agreement is a contract." <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). And as we have previously recognized, "it is well-established that an oral settlement agreement is binding on the parties, particularly when the terms are memorialized into the record." <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 229 F.3d 1088, 1090 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see also Goodwin v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 983 F.2d 226, 228 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (noting that an oral Board agreement "was valid and binding on the parties").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Tiburzi twice concedes in his informal brief that he "did enter into a settlement agreement with the [agency] as before [the administrative judge] in which I resigned my position as a Special Agent," and that he "did so on the court record."[2] But petitioner argues that the oral agreement should be set aside because he did not "sign or accept the official written agreement." In other words, Mr. Tiburzi argues that his acceptance of the oral agreement is not binding absent the parties' subsequent approval of a written memorialization of that agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Elsewhere in his informal brief, petitioner concedes that "I realize that I did agree to the settlement on the record before the [administrative] judge and that I must take responsibility for those actions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Parties often enter into oral contracts with the understanding that a written contract will follow that merely memorializes the oral contract. It is well-settled under our cases that if no written agreement is forthcoming, the oral agreement still governs. In <span class="Italic">Singer Co., Librascope Div. v. United States</span>, 568 F.2d 695 (Ct. Cl. 1977), for example, one of our predecessor courts, the Court of Claims, affirmed the trial court's determination that the government contractor was bound by its oral agreement with the government even though the contractor had "never submitted...the signed letter of acceptance that had been requested" by the government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 707. In reaching that conclusion, the trial court reasoned in pertinent part that the contractor had not shown that the parties intended to "postpone a binding contractual commitment" until the execution of a "later written memorial of their agreement":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Plaintiff points to nothing in the record to warrant the conclusion that either party intended to postpone a binding contractual commitment until evidence of their understanding had been formalized by way of a signed letter of acceptance. The Government's letter...asked [the contractor] to signify its acceptance and exceptions by telegram, this then to be followed by a signed letter of acceptance. In its telegrammed response, [the contractor] noted its concurrence. These manifestations of assent were sufficient in themselves to conclude an agreement and <span class="Italic">contract law would not inhibit such effect merely because the parties may also have manifested an intention to prepare and adopt a later written memorial of their agreement</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 707 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), on the particular facts of that case (discussed below), we concluded that the parties had not intended an oral settlement agreement (negotiated telephonically) to be binding until it was reduced to writing. Thus, we held that the oral agreement there was not a "final settlement of plaintiffs" claims that the agency had improperly removed her from her position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1129.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, our cases make clear that where the parties intend to enter into an oral agreement, it is binding on the parties even if its terms are not embodied in a subsequent written instrument. Decisions of a number of our sister courts of appeals are in accord. <span class="Italic">See Chedd-Angier Prod. Co. v. Omni Publ'ns Int'l, Ltd.</span>, 756 F.2d 930, 935 (1st Cir. 1985) (affirming jury verdict that the parties "agreed upon the essential terms of the [oral] contract prior to memorializing the contract in writing"); <span class="Italic">Int'l Telemeter Corp. v. Teleprompter Corp.</span>, 592 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir. 1979) (affirming district court's decision that the parties entered into a binding oral settlement agreement "prior to signing and delivery of a written agreement").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondary sources provide further support for the proposition that an oral agreement between parties is binding even if the parties contemplate the execution of a later written agreement and no subsequent written instrument is in fact executed. Professor Williston states, for example, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]here it was understood that the contract should be formally drawn up, and put in writing, <span class="Italic">the transaction is nevertheless complete and binding, absent a positive agreement that it should not be binding until so reduced to writing and formally executed. This is the position adopted by both Restatements [of Contracts]</span><span class="Italic"></span> , the drafters recognizing that, though the parties may intend to memorialize their agreement, the memorial is not necessary in the absence of a statute requiring it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1 Samuel Williston, <span class="Italic">Williston on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 4:8, at 300-302 (4th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, <span class="Italic">the Restatement (Second) of Contracts</span> (1981) makes clear that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof; but the circumstances may show that the agreements are preliminary negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at &#x00A7; 27.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also, e.g.</span>, 1 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 30, at 110 (1963) ("The evidence may be convincing that the parties intend to reduce their already consummated [oral] contract to writing as a mere 'memorial' thereof and not as their only operative expression of assent. <span class="Italic">In such a case, the contract is valid even though they try and fail to agree upon the form and terms of the memorial</span>.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4756"></span>Under existing law, an oral agreement is binding absent a showing that the parties "did not intend to be bound until a written contract-was signed." <span class="Italic">Sargent</span>, 229 F.2d at 1090. There is no such showing here, as petitioner himself appears to concede. Moreover, the hearing transcript shows that the parties intended to achieve a settlement agreement on the date of the hearing. Counsel for petitioner, for example, informed the administrative judge that petitioner would resign "effective today, <span class="Italic">which is the date of the execution of the agreement</span>, although we do contemplate that there will be a signed agreement" (emphasis added). The balance of the hearing transcript also shows that the parties and the administrative judge understood that a complete, binding agreement had been reached. Indeed, the administrative judge asked the parties four times whether the terms entered into the record "constitute all the terms of the settlement agreement," and all parties (including Mr. Tiburzi) answered in the affirmative. Finally, all parties agreed that both the oral agreement and any subsequent written memorialization would be enforceable by the Board. Counsel for petitioner, for example, informed the administrative judge in pertinent part that the "oral representation of what the settlement agreement is and the written settlement agreement will become part of the record here and enforced, and enforceable by Your Honor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent suggests that the settlement agreement was invalid because the IDEA attorney lacked authority to enter into the agreement. But there was no allegation below that the IDEA attorney lacked that authority, and no evidence that she did. The IDEA attorney's statement that she voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement "to the extent [she] count[s] as agency counsel" suggests only that she was not personally bound by the settlement agreement, and not, as the dissent submits, that she lacked authority to enter into the agreement on the agency's behalf. Likewise, the IDEA attorney's promise to return to petitioner a signed copy of the agreement once she obtained an original signature on behalf of the Agency "does not suggest a lack of authority to enter into an oral settlement agreement, particularly when she repeatedly represented to the administrative judge that "the parties have entered into a settlement agreement." To construe statements such as those relied on by the dissent as indicating a lack of authority would call into question a wide range of valid settlements, to the detriment of both the United States and agency employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, substantial evidence shows that the parties intended the oral settlement agreement to be binding and enforceable even absent the execution of a subsequent written agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This situation is quite different from the facts of <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), where we concluded that the parties there had not intended an oral settlement agreement (negotiated telephonically) to be binding until it was reduced to writing. At the outset, we recognize that the written agreements in <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span> and this case could arguably be distinguished based upon the language of their respective integration clauses. The written contract at issue in <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span> contained an integration clause that stated in pertinent part that "[t]here are no other agreements between the parties, either express or implied, oral or written." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1129. The written agreement here does not explicitly refer to "other [oral] agreements between the parties."[5] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> But this arguable distinction is irrelevant. All well-drafted contracts contain integration clauses. And the term "integration clause" is in turn defined as "[a] contractual provision stating that the contract represents the parties' complete and final agreement <span class="Italic">and supersedes all informal understandings and oral agreements</span> relating to the subject matter of the contract." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 812 (7th ed. 1999) (emphasis added). Thus, an integration clause by definition disposes of prior "oral agreements," and the stylistic differences in the integration clauses here are not grounds upon which to distinguish <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span> from this case. There are, however, material differences between this case and <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The integration clause in the written agreement at issue here states in pertinent part that "[t]his [written] agreement represents the full and complete agreement of the parties hereto. No other promises or agreements will be binding unless placed in writing and signed by both parties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, unlike <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, the record itself reflects petitioner's explicit acceptance of the oral agreement. Also, the written settlement agreement at issue in <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, drafted by the Navy and sent to petitioner, was "almost completely different from the terms discussed in the telephone conference," in that it contained "various new terms of settlement that were not even mentioned in the telephone conference." <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, 928 F.2d at 1129.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The written agreement in this case, in contrast, was by no means "almost completely different" from the oral agreement reached at the Board hearing<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Rather, the parties at the hearing specifically agreed to the material provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do note that the written agreement drafted by the agency contains one arguably material change from the oral agreement, in that the written agreement (and revised SF-50) specifies an earlier resignation date for Mr. Tiburzi (May 1, 2000) than did the oral agreement (July 21, 2000). But the agency's mere proposal of a different resignation date in its July 27, 2000, draft of the written agreement does not require the invalidation of the entire oral settlement agreement. Rather, the July 21, 2000, resignation date set forth in the oral agreement continues to govern. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 30, at 110 (1963) ("Afterthoughts cannot be brought into the contract except by mutual assent; and the informal contract stands as made.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The lesson from <span class="Italic">Tiburzi</span> and kindred decisions is that if an oral settlement contemplates a later written agreement that will supersede the oral agreement, the provision for the written agreement must be plainly stated in the terms of the oral agreement. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 91 MSPR 36, 38-41 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9 (2002), decided that the record of the oral settlement contained no condition of a subsequent, more complete, written agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...During the pendency of the appeal, the parties entered into a settlement agreement that was tape-recorded and read into the record by the administrative judge. Under the terms of the settlement, the agency agreed to "execute a new SF-50 reflecting that the appellant resigned from the agency effective December 15, 2000 for personal reasons," to "remove all documentation from the appellant's official personnel folder which reflects he was removed for the reasons reflected in the notice of proposed removal," and to "provide the appellant with all benefits or offers of benefits to which he would have been entitled had the appellant resigned on December 15, 2000, rather than having been removed on that date" within 45 days from the date of the agreement. The appellant, in turn, agreed to "readily assist the agency by providing any necessary documents or signatures needed by the agency to execute the new SF-50," not to "challenge in any administrative or judicial forum any agency action that was or could have been included in his [Board] appeal or any other matter arising from his employment with the agency," and not to "apply for or accept employment at any time in the future for any position with Robbins Air Force Base, Georgia." The parties also agreed that "the terms of this agreement will be reduced to writing, and the written agreement, signed by all parties, will serve as the official agreement for enforcement purposes should enforcement issues arise in the future." On May 9, 2001, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as settled. The initial decision informed the parties that they had until June 13 2001, to file a timely petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We REOPEN this appeal for the limited purpose of determining whether the parties have entered into a valid oral settlement agreement. ...[T]he agency contends that it had not entered into an enforceable settlement agreement. We therefore address whether the parties have entered into a valid oral settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that when the parties met to reduce the agreement to writing, the appellant objected to several "boilerplate" clauses that the agency included in the written agreement and then refused to sign the agreement. The appellant asserts that the written settlement agreement prepared by the agency's representative attempted to change the terms of the verbal agreement without the appellant's approval. The agency asserts that there was never a final settlement of this appeal. The agency contends that its representative clearly notified the administrative judge and the appellant that it would only be bound by a written agreement signed by the appellant. They further state that this position was necessitated by the agency's regulations that require certain "boilerplate" clauses to be included in all settlement agreements. Since the appellant took exception to those "boilerplate" clauses, the agency contends that there was no meeting of the minds and, thus, no settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Federal Circuit have ruled that an oral agreement is valid and binding on parties and have enforced an oral agreement when the appellant has subsequently declined to sign a written document memorializing the terms of the earlier oral agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g., Tiburzi v. Department of Justice,</span> 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Ali v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 MSPR 563, 569 (1991). Even where there is language suggesting that the oral agreement will be reduced to writing, that alone is insufficient to invalidate a valid oral agreement<span class="Italic">. Tiburzi,</span> 269 F.3d at 1351. An oral agreement is binding absent a showing that the parties "did not intend to be bound until a written contract was signed." <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 229 F.3d 1088, 1090 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy,</span> 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court examined, in part, the transcript of the hearing tape to determine that the parties had not intended an oral settlement agreement to be the final settlement of the appeal until it was reduced to writing. The transcript of the tape in that case made it clear that the oral settlement agreement would later be reduced to writing and submitted to the parties for their approval and signatures, and that "until and unless" this was done there would be no settlement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1128.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The tape-recording of the agreement in the instant case contains no statements that only a written and signed agreement would be binding <span id="Page_4757"></span>on the parties. Although the agency claims that it clearly notified the administrative judge and the appellant that it would only be bound by a written agreement signed by the appellant, and that this notice would be evident in a transcript of the pre-conference hearing, the tape-recording of the pre-hearing conference does not contain any such statement by the agency's representative. During the recorded conference, the administrative judge clearly stated that he was reading the terms of the Agreement into the record at that time and then proceeded to read each term of the agreement into the record. The parties then agreed that they both voluntarily and freely entered into the agreement. When asked if the administrative judge had recited the balance of the agreement, both parties agreed that he had and the agency's representative clearly stated, "I think that includes everything." Thus, the settlement tape makes clear that the parties had, in fact, reached an enforceable settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is evident from the tape of the oral settlement agreement that the written version of this agreement was intended only as a memorialization of the valid oral agreement. Although, the parties did contemplate a written settlement agreement, where the parties intend to enter into an oral agreement, it is binding on the parties even if its terms are not embodied in a subsequent written instrument. <span class="Italic">Tiburzi,</span> 269 F.3d at 1352. The administrative judge, therefore, was correct when he found that a settlement agreement had been reached and was properly entered into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Haefele v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 108 MSPR 630, 633-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12, 2008 MSPB 103 (2008), also emphasized that an oral settlement, accepted by the AJ into the record for purposes of enforcement, is complete and within the Board's enforcement authority unless the agreement specifically conditions effectiveness of the settlement on subsequent submission of a written agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to enforce a settlement agreement which, like the agreement in this case, has been entered into the record in the same manner as any final Board decision or order. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 248, 250 (1981). Because a settlement agreement is a contract, the Board will adjudicate an enforcement proceeding relevant to a settlement agreement in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 602, &#x00B6; 13 (2006); <span class="Italic">see Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). As the party asserting noncompliance, the appellant bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that the agency breached the settlement agreement, however, following the appellant's filing of a petition for enforcement, the agency must produce relevant, material evidence of its compliance with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Perkins,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 541, 546 (1998)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency does not dispute that it has failed to process the personnel actions required by the May 22, 2007 oral settlement agreement recorded by the administrative judge. The agency has consistently contended, however, that the agreement was not binding until it was reduced to writing and signed by the parties. The central issue in this case is the correctness of the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Federal Circuit have ruled that an oral settlement agreement is valid and binding on the parties and have enforced an oral agreement where the appellant has subsequently declined to sign a written document memorializing the terms of the earlier oral agreement. <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Department of Justice,</span> 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7 (2002); <span class="Italic">Ali v. Department of the Army,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 563, 569 (1991). Even where there is language suggesting that the oral agreement will be reduced to writing, that alone is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise valid oral agreement. <span class="Italic">Tiburzi,</span> 269 F.3d at 1351; <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7. Only where the record shows that the parties did not intend to be bound until the agreement was reduced to writing and signed is an oral settlement agreement not binding on the parties. <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 229 F.3d 1088, 1090 (Fed. Cir. 2000).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The court in <span class="Italic">Sargent</span> contrasted the facts of that case with the situation in <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy,</span> 928 F.2d 1126, 1128-30 (Fed. Cir. 1991), where the court found that an oral settlement was not binding until it was reduced to writing because the parties there clearly did not intend to be bound until a written contract was signed. <span class="Italic">Sargent,</span> 229 F.3d at 1090.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As found by the administrative judge, the May 22, 2007 oral settlement agreement between the parties did not indicate that the agreement was conditioned in any way upon it being reduced to writing and signed by the parties. In fact, as the administrative judge noted, the agreement provided that the agency could implement the appellant's resignation without her completing an SF-52, request for personnel action, "based upon this settlement agreement." The agency has not pointed to specific language in the agreement supporting its interpretation; rather, it asserts that the parties "intended" and "understood" that the settlement agreement would be reduced to writing before it would be considered binding. In support of its position, the agency provides an affidavit from a civilian personnel officer who apparently served as a technical advisor during the settlement discussions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that in construing the terms of a settlement agreement the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance, and parol evidence will be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Greco,</span> 852 F.2d at 560; <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). There is nothing ambiguous in the language of the settlement agreement regarding whether it needed to be reduced to writing and signed to bind the parties. Thus, the agency's assertions regarding the intent or understanding of the parties at the time of the settlement agreement need not be considered. Accordingly, the agency's contention regarding the settlement agreement is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned above, the agency does not deny that it has failed to process the personnel actions required by the settlement agreement. Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's recommendation that the agency has breached the settlement agreement and is in noncompliance. Where the Board finds a breach of a settlement agreement, the nonbreaching party has the choice of enforcement of the terms of the agreement or rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Powell v. Department of Commerce,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 14 (2005); <span class="Italic">Fuller v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 611, 614 (1990). Here, the appellant has indicated her desire to have her appeal reinstated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the unusual case of <span class="Italic">Wilson v. OPM</span>, AT-844E-09-0761-A-1 (NP 9/19/2011), involving counsel fees, appellant's counsel filed a sworn declaration with the Board asserting that there was what appeared to be a verbal agreement of OPM to pay fees. OPM was directed to respond to the declaration and failed to do so. The Board determined that the uncontested declaration was sufficient evidence of a settlement to enforce the agreement against OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 24, 2010, the administrative judge issued an initial decision regarding the appellant's request for attorney fees and awarded $2,125.00. On September 27, 2010, the appellant filed a timely petition "to vacate [the] initial decision" in which her attorney alleges, under penalty of perjury, that "[o]n August 25, 2010, [OPM's representative] contacted [the appellant's] attorney and the parties then agreed that OPM would pay $9,700.00 as a reasonable attorney fee in this matter."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM did not respond to the appellant's petition. On January 11, 2011, the Clerk of the Board issued a show cause order, instructing OPM to respond to the appellant's allegations that a settlement agreement was reached in this matter. The order specifically afforded OPM 20 calendar days in which to respond. OPM failed to respond until May 17, 2011, at which time a new representative for OPM asserted under penalty of perjury that she could not find any evidence that OPM's previous representative and the appellant's representative entered into an oral or written settlement agreement. OPM's submission failed to address in any way OPM's more than 3 month delay in responding to the January 11, 2011 order and therefore did not show good cause for the untimeliness of the response. On June 21, 2011, the Board issued an order directing OPM "to show cause why the Board should not find that the parties entered into a valid, enforceable agreement concerning attorney fees." In the order, the Board explained that because OPM failed to show good cause for its untimely response to the January 11, 2011 order, OPM's May 17, 2011 response would not be considered. The order dated June 21, 2011 provided OPM with 20 calendar days to respond. OPM has failed to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that "[s]worn statements that are not rebutted are competent evidence of the matters asserted therein." <span class="Italic">Aldridge v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 9 (2008); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Truitt v. Department of the Navy,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 344, 347 (1990). In its June 21, 2011 order, the Board informed OPM that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the absence of any response from OPM, the assertions of the appellant's attorney, under penalty of perjury, appear sufficient to establish that the parties have entered into a settlement agreement, understand its terms, and intended to enter their oral settlement agreement into the record for enforcement by the Board. We also note that the alleged agreement is lawful on its face, that the award of attorney fees is clearly a matter within the Board's jurisdiction, and that there is nothing in the record to suggest that OPM did not freely enter into the alleged agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite this warning, as noted above, OPM failed to respond. Based upon the record evidence, and because OPM has failed to timely argue otherwise, we hold that there was an agreement between the parties that OPM would pay $9,700.00 in attorney fees to the appellant. We further hold that this agreement was lawful, freely entered into, and that the parties intended that it be entered into the record for enforcement by the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">By way of a practice note, oral settlements should be avoided. They are often hastily negotiated and lack from the completeness and polish of a written settlement that has progressed through drafts carefully reviewed. Exchanges of written drafts also allow the parties to give more thought to what needs <span id="Page_4758"></span>to be included in an agreement and, significantly, the delays inherent in the exchanges allow the appellant more time to reflect and consult concerning the choices and risks among and between settlement options and continued litigation. To ensure that oral settlements are not created when they are not intended, negotiate with explicit statements that nothing is settled without a written and fully signed agreement. Reject as well the temptation to reach an oral settlement on the supposition that the parties will then add to or clarify the oral settlement with a later written agreement. Too often those agreements do not materialize because the parties cannot agree on further points of substance.
