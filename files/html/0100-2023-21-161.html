<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Love v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 641, 643-45, 647-49 (1991) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love &#x0026; Penn,</span> 962 F.2d 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>), again exploring qualifying court orders and the ability to modify an earlier order that did, or did not, address division of marital property, approved bifurcated divorce decrees when the first decree concludes a marriage by divorce and the second decree or order divides marital property, including annuity interests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When John W. Love retired from the Federal service in 1972, he elected to receive a reduced retirement annuity in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for his wife, the appellant. In the Loves' 1987 divorce action, the Oklahoma district court adjudicated the dissolution of marriage and property settlement issues separately. The court entered a divorce decree dissolving the marriage on August 11, 1987, but reserved "all matters relating to property division and alimony...for future consideration and decision." On December 21, 1987, the Loves entered into a settlement agreement that included the following provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">John W. Love agrees that Lois G. Love shall have any and all benefits which she may be lawfully entitled to as the divorced spouse of a retired United States Postal Service employee. Lois G. Love agrees to pay all costs hereafter incurred which are assignable to her retaining her status as a beneficiary of said employment benefits. That John W. Love and Lois G. Love agree to cooperate with the other in her obtaining all benefits to which she is entitled from the United States Postal Service including, but not limited to, obtaining the necessary Court Orders to enable her to receive said benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 31, 1987, the court entered two orders; the first approved the property settlement agreement, and the second, styled as a "Qualified Domestic Relations Order," specified that, upon the death of John Love, the appellant was to receive the benefits due her as a former spouse under the Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) determined that it could not honor the Qualified Domestic Relations Order and court-approved settlement agreement, relying on the following provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5) of this subsection, a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, or annuitant...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be effective--(A) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and (B) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM reasoned that, since a decree of divorce was entered on August 11, 1987, the subsequent orders of December 31 awarding the appellant a former spouse annuity constituted a modification to the divorce decree that was prohibited under subsection 8341(h)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following OPM's determination, the appellant obtained from the state district court an Order Nunc Pro Tunc, dated September 16, 1988, which stated that "the Decree of Divorce entered by this Court on August 11, 1987, shall be amended and corrected to include" the Qualified Domestic Relations Order awarding the appellant a former spouse annuity. The appellant contended that the Order Nunc Pro Tunc made the Qualified Domestic Relations Order retroactive to August 11, 1987, when the divorce decree was entered, and thus was not a modification to the decree. OPM rejected this contention based on its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(e), which provides as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board's regional office, the administrative judge found that the Qualifying Domestic Relations Order of December 31, 1987, which incorporated the property settlement agreement of December 21, 1987, entitled the appellant to survivor annuity benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1), since it expressly provided for such benefits and was "incident to" the decree of divorce. She found unpersuasive OPM's contention that the court orders of December 31 modified the earlier issued decree of divorce, since the December 31 orders were the first to address property division issues in the divorce proceeding, and since nothing in subsection 8341(h) specifies that a qualifying order must be the first order terminating the marital relationship. The administrative judge agreed with the appellant's contention that the provisions of section 831.1704(e) relied on by OPM had no application to the appellant, because they did not become effective until January 3, 1989, after the entry of the state court orders at issue in the appellant's case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">...</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that OPM has similarly placed an unreasonable restriction on the provision in section 8341(h)(4) rendering ineffective a court order awarding a former spouse annuity if it constitutes a "modification" to the divorce decree or court-approved property settlement agreement. As the administrative judge observed, a court order establishing a former spouse annuity should not be viewed as a modification to a previously issued decree of divorce when the later order is the first order to deal with property division and alimony issues. <span class="Italic">See Warman v. Warman,</span> 294 Pa. Super. 285, 439 A.2d 1203, 1209 (1982) ("modification decree" is an order modifying or replacing a prior decree concerning the identical issues); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in the legislative history of the Spouse Equity Act that directly addresses Congressional intent with respect to a bifurcated divorce action in which the court first grants a divorce, and later divides the marital assets. The legislative history does, however, exhibit great concern about the financial security of former spouses of Federal employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For most former spouses of Federal employees, the threat of living in poverty is exacerbated. Most of these women remained in the home during their marriages and are not eligible for either social security or private pensions. Access to survivor benefits is vital to this group of former spouses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H.R. No. 1054, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 12, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1984 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 5540, 5542-43. To disallow a court-awarded former spouse annuity simply because state court procedure allows for a bifurcated divorce proceeding would greatly frustrate the statutory purpose of providing for the financial security of former spouses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM claims that allowing bifurcated divorce proceedings of the type involved in this case would permit a retiree to obtain a life rate annuity when the initial divorce decree is issued, and to retain that unreduced annuity even after the court later issues an order awarding a former spouse annuity. This claim is simply wrong. The law specifically requires OPM to reduce a retiree's annuity upon the award of a former spouse annuity under section 8341(h). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM does have a legitimate concern, however, about the gap period in bifurcated divorce actions between the issuance of the divorce decree and the division of marital assets. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A), any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee must be terminated for each full month after the dissolution of the spouse's marriage to the employee, except when the spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h). Since a divorce decree dissolves a marriage, and it is the dissolution of marriage that triggers the operation of section 8339(j)(5)(A), the retiree in a bifurcated proceeding would be entitled to a full life rate annuity during the period between the divorce decree and the order dividing the marital assets. OPM could address this concern, however, without completely invalidating all awards of former spouse annuities in bifurcated proceedings. It could, for example, promulgate a rule requiring that the retiree or the former spouse deposit into the Civil Service Retirement Fund the amount by which the retiree's annuity would have been reduced had the award of a survivor annuity been made contemporaneously with the decree of divorce as it has in several other situations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8341(h) constitutes remedial legislation designed to remedy the gap in survivor annuity coverage that had existed under previous law. It must therefore be broadly construed to achieve its remedial purpose. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Kleindienst,</span> 357 F. Supp. 749, 751 (D.D.C. 1973); <span class="Italic">Hollander</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. at 200. Accordingly, we hold that a court order awarding a former spouse annuity is not a modification within the meaning of section 8341(h)(4), when it is the first order in which the court adjudicates property division issues. We therefore find that the Oklahoma district court order of December 31, 1987, effectively awarded a former spouse annuity that OPM must honor, as it was the first order adjudicating the division of the Loves' marital property.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hernandez v. OPM</span>, 61 MSPR 264, 265-68 (1994), concluded there was no bar to a later court order implementing a component of the initial divorce decree that divided property, including annuity interests:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Saul Hernandez (decedent) were divorced on November 14, 1986, after more than 32 years of marriage. The decedent retired from the civil service in 1987, and died on February 2, 1992. The appellant thereafter filed a timely appeal of OPM's reconsideration decision denying her civil service survivor annuity benefits as the decedent's former spouse. The appellant based her application for survivor annuity benefits on a February 23, 1987 court order adjudicating the appellant's and the decedent's marital property division in connection <span id="Page_4374"></span>with their divorce on November 14, 1986. In its reconsideration decision, OPM noted that, on his retirement application, the decedent indicated that he was unmarried and did not elect a reduced annuity in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for his former spouse. Further, OPM found that the February 1987 court order, which awarded the appellant a portion of the decedent's annuity, was not a qualifying court order for survivor annuity purposes because it was not the first court order that adjudicated the marital property division issues. Rather, OPM concluded, the February 1987 court order was a modification of the first November 1986 order and, therefore, the appellant was not entitled to the court-awarded survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the documentary record, the administrative judge reversed OPM's reconsideration decision, finding that: The November 1986 court order, while dissolving the marriage, specifically reserved for a later time the resolution of the appellant's community property interest in the decedent's civil service retirement benefits; the decedent and his counsel knew that the court had reserved jurisdiction over the dissolution proceeding for the sole purpose of equitably distributing the decedent's civil service retirement benefits; the parties stipulated to the bifurcated procedure that allowed the court to award a survivor annuity to the appellant; all of the information necessary for OPM's compliance with the February 1987 court order was before OPM less than 1 month after the decedent's retirement, but OPM nevertheless failed to notify the appellant that she was not eligible for a survivor annuity; and the decedent attempted to mislead OPM and the court regarding the date and nature of his retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, OPM contends that the initial decision should be reversed as erroneous, reiterating its argument made below that the appellant was not entitled to a court-awarded survivor annuity based on the February 1987 court order because it was a prohibited modification of the November 1986 divorce decree that OPM claimed dissolved the marriage and divided the marital property. Further, OPM conceded that it erroneously applied superseded regulations in its reconsideration decision but contends that the appellant is nevertheless not entitled to survivor annuity benefits because the November 1986 divorce decree was the first court order that divided the marital property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Insofar as pertinent to this appeal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) provides that a former spouse of a deceased annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity, "if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3)], or in the terms or any decree of divorce or annulment of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree."[2] Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), "a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)] shall not be effective...if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and...to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection." In <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1011-13 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the court held that, in a bifurcated divorce proceeding such as occurred in this appeal, a court order that is issued subsequent to a divorce decree and that addresses the issues of property division and settlement for the first time is not a prohibited modification of the divorce decree under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In its superseded regulations, OPM interpreted this provision to allow a court-ordered survivor annuity only if such annuity was ordered in the first court order dissolving the marriage. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(e) (1989). OPM revised its regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(e), consistent with decisions by the Board and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit finding OPM's interpretation to be invalid on the basis that a court order that first addresses the issue of property division and settlement was not a prohibited modification under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). <span class="Italic">See Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, 1010-13 (Fed. Cir. 1992)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this appeal is whether, in bifurcated divorce proceedings, a subsequent order is a prohibited modification under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) when it is not the first order to address issues of property division and settlement. We find that, in this case, the February 1987 court order was not a prohibited modification because it was not a "modification" and it did not occur after the decedent's retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the February 1987 court order was not the first court order that addressed the issue of marital property division. Rather, the November 1986 divorce decree expressly divided the parties' marital properties, including household furnishings, automobiles, proceeds of the sale of their family home, an individual retirement account, and an income tax refund. The November 1986 divorce decree also awarded the appellant a portion of the decedent's civil service retirement benefits subject to subsequent adjustment and also reserved judicial disposition of other marital property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the bifurcated divorce proceedings in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008, differ from this appeal in that the subsequent court order in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love</span> was the first order addressing property issues, the court's rationale for finding that the subsequent order was a qualifying court order applies here. The court found that the subsequent property settlement was not a "modification" of the divorce decree because it did not change, alter, or limit any prior disposition of the divorcing couple's property. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1011. Likewise, in this appeal, the November 1986 divorce decree, although it divided a large portion of the divorcing couple's property, specifically retained jurisdiction over the division of the decedent's retirement annuity, including any provision of a survivor annuity. Because the apportionment of the decedent's retirement annuity and any provision of a survivor annuity was still an open matter after the November 1986 divorce decree, the February 1987 court order cannot be said to change, alter, or limit the prior disposition of the decedent's retirement benefits; there was no final disposition to change, alter, or limit. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The court set the February 1987 trial date at the time of the first court order because it could not resolve all of the disputed issues at that time. The February 1987 decree thus expanded on, rather than altered, the November 1986 divorce decree. The February 1987 decree was simply a continuation in the process of the divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in passing the Civil service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Congress did not focus on the widespread availability of bifurcated divorce proceedings and the attendant likelihood that property settlements including survivor annuity benefits would be entered incident but subsequent to divorce decrees. <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d at 1012. The appellant falls within the very class of appellants that the Spouse Equity Act was specifically designed to protect. OPM's view ignores the growing prevalence of bifurcated divorce proceedings, <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> and fails to take into account Congress's clear intent to provide survivor annuities to former spouses of Federal employees. As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> "[i]f Congress wishes to deny implementation of survivor annuity benefits in bifurcated divorce proceedings, that choice is its to make."<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1013.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Griffin v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 467, 469-72 (1996) (Member Amador dissenting) (following remand and entry of intervenor, 75 MSPR 263 (1997), result unchanged, recon. den., 83 MSPR 67 (1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), the first decree sketched the outline for division of annuity interests and a later decree was held permissibly to have filled in the details. Member Amador dissenting, essentially suggested that since the first decree addressed the annuity interests, the second decree was an ineffective modification of the first:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When John Griffin retired in 1986, he elected to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide survivor annuity benefits for his wife, the appellant. In the February 26, 1990 divorce decree, the Michigan Circuit Court dissolved their marriage, divided their property, and specified that a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) shall be entered granting the appellant 60% of Mr. Griffin's "total Post Office Pension" and, except as otherwise provided, awarding to each party individually his or her interest in "[a]ny pension, annuity or retirement benefits." On July 23, 1990, the same court entered a <span class="Italic">nunc pro tunc</span> QDRO that further assigned a portion of Mr. Griffin's retirement benefits to the appellant, including certain survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following his divorce from the appellant, Mr. Griffin did not elect survivor annuity benefits for her as a former spouse by filing an election with OPM within 2 years from the date of the divorce; instead, he designated his second wife, Linda Sloan, to receive survivor annuity benefits. The appellant received a portion of Mr. Griffin's retirement benefits until his death in 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Mr. Griffin's death, OPM terminated all payments to the appellant. In its reconsideration decision, OPM found that the July 1990 court order acceptable for processing was not the first order dividing marital property. As such, it was a modification of the February 1990 divorce decree and could not be given effect to provide the appellant with survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant reasserts that the court order acceptable for processing was an "integrated part of the bifurcated divorce proceeding," rather than a prohibited modification of the original divorce decree. <span class="Italic">See</span> Petition for Review at 3. OPM did not file a response to that petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) a former spouse of a deceased annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity, "if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(3)], or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), "a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1)] shall not be effective...if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and...to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection." In other words, a second court order is an invalid modification of a first court order under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), if it falls under one of the two following categories: (1) it constitutes a modification of the first order made after the retirement of the employee <span id="Page_4375"></span>or Member concerned; or (2) it constitutes a modification of the first order that involves an annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love,</span> 962 F.2d 1008 (Fed.

The court reasoned that, even though the subsequent court order was issued after the former spouse had retired, it did not constitute a modification under either of the two categories prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4), because the first court order, the divorce decree, only dissolved the marriage and did not divide any marital property.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1011-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hernandez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the court order acceptable for processing in this appeal, unlike the second court order in <span class="Italic">Hernandez...,</span> was issued after the former spouse's retirement, we find that our holding in that case is controlling here. As in <span class="Italic">Hernandez,</span> the appellant and her former spouse were also divorced in a bifurcated proceeding. Their February 26, 1990 divorce decree, like the divorce decree in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 267-68<span class="Italic">,</span> distributed some marital property but reserved the annuity issue for the second order, the court order acceptable for processing. Specifically, the appellant's divorce decree provided that a court order acceptable for processing would be entered granting the appellant 60% of her former spouse's "total Post Office Pension."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with that provision of the divorce decree, the court subsequently issued the court order acceptable for processing on July 23, 1990, expressly providing for the appellant to receive 60% of the monthly annuity which her former spouse was receiving during his lifetime and, upon his death, a survivor annuity worth at least that amount per month. Like the subsequent court order in <span class="Italic">Hernandez...</span>then, the court order acceptable for processing in this appeal "expanded on," rather than altered, the first court order. As such, the court order acceptable for processing in this appeal was not a "modification" and, thus, did not constitute a prohibited modification under either of the two categories set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) <span class="Italic">See Hernandez....</span> The fact that the appellant's court order acceptable for processing, like the subsequent property settlement orders in <span class="Italic">Love,</span> 962 F.2d at 1011-13, was issued after her former spouse's retirement, does not require a different result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This result, we find, is consistent with Congress' intent in enacting the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, to protect former spouses like the appellant.&#8197;...Accordingly, we find that the court order acceptable for processing entitles the appellant to a survivor annuity equal to 60% of the reduced annuity amount that her former spouse was receiving during his lifetime, or the maximum 55% survivor annuity based on an unreduced annuity amount, whichever is smaller. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b), (h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unless the appellant's court order acceptable for processing is given effect, Linda Sloan, as the designated beneficiary, is entitled to 100% of the survivor annuity based on her former spouse's federal service. That is, absent a valid court order acceptable for processing, Sloan is entitled to the maximum 55% survivor annuity based on an unreduced annuity amount. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b)(1), (4). Because this appeal directly affects Sloan's entitlement to that benefit, the interest of justice would be served by permitting her to intervene and to present relevant evidence and argument, and we thus find that Sloan must be informed of this appeal and permitted to intervene....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1999 reconsideration decision, <span class="Italic">Griffin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After <span class="Italic">Griffin I</span> was issued, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 122 F.3d 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In that case, the petitioner's 199033 divorce decree divided the marital assets, including the former spouse's retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1044-45, 1048. Specifically, during the divorce proceedings, the magistrate found that the petitioner should receive 50% of her former spouse's "future retirement benefit annuity when distributed" and, in accordance with that finding, awarded her, "[a]s her portion of said civil service retirement benefits,...the sum of $556 per month." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1044-45.

Rather, the first court order in <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span> dissolved the marriage and disposed of all of the marital assets including the decedent's civil service retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span>, 122 F.3d at 1044-45, 1048. Hence, under the facts in <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span>, there was no need for the court to address, and the court did not address, the situation in <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span> and in this appeal, where the first court order in a bifurcated divorce proceeding divides some of the marital property but reserves the division of retirement benefits for a subsequent court order and the subsequent court order then divides such benefits, including a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span> the court did not even mention the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Griffin I</span> and <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>. <span class="Italic">See generally Hokanson</span>, 122 F.3d at 1047-48. We therefore conclude that <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span> does not disturb the Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Griffin I</span> and <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span> concerning a first court order that, as part of a bifurcated divorce proceeding, divides some marital assets but reserves for a subsequent court order the award of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Hokanson</span>, 122 F.3d at 1047-48; <span class="Italic">Griffin I</span> at 470-71; <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 267-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, and upon reconsideration, we remain convinced that the appellant, not the intervenor, is entitled to a survivor annuity based on Mr. Griffin's federal service. We therefore deny the Director of OPM's petition for reconsideration and reaffirm our previous decisions in this case.</p>
