<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-80"><span class="space">a.</span> Interactive Process; Medical Documentation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">When an accommodation is required, the need for the accommodation must be known or made known to the agency. The employee and the agency are to then pursue discussion and exchange of information leading to a reasonable accommodation, if one is possible. The process of identifying an accommodation should involve participation and interaction by the employee and the employer. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mengine v. Runyon</span>, 114 F.3d 415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997) (citing 29 CFR 1630.2(o)(3); 29 CFR Part 1630, App. at 351). <span class="Italic">Collins v. USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 332, 336-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (2005), determined to be adequate what amounted to an agency hearing on the accommodation for a disabled employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3) provides that an employer may need "to initiate an informal, interactive process" with the employee in order to determine what actions might constitute a reasonable accommodation of the employee's disability. The same section provides further that "[t]his process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations." The appellant seems to argue that the agency failed to carry out its responsibility under this provision by failing to search for suitable positions to which he could be assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both parties, however, have an obligation to assist in the search for an appropriate accommodation, and both have an obligation to act in good faith in doing so. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Phoenixville School District</span>, 184 F.3d 296, 312 (3d Cir. 1999). In this case, as noted above, the agency held a hearing to address the appellant's request for accommodation. The letter the agency issued to the appellant following the hearing suggests that the agency had not conducted a search for appropriate positions at that time, and that it had instead considered only the possibility of modifying the appellant's city carrier duties. It did specifically note, however, that one of the options available to the appellant was to apply for a position for which he physically qualified. Instead of indicating that he was interested in that option, the appellant submitted his application for retirement within a few days after issuance of the letter....&#8197;The appellant has asserted on petition for review that he did not pursue the option of seeking reassignment because he "reasonably believed he would not have been given an opportunity to get another collective bargaining position because of retaliation for his protected disclosures." We find this assertion unpersuasive. The appellant's alleged belief that he would not be treated fairly does not relieve him of the obligation to cooperate in the "interactive process" mentioned above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we see no basis for finding that the agency was obligated to continue the "interactive process" by searching for positions to which the appellant might be assigned. The appellant's submission of his retirement application, and his failure to provide any indication that he would be interested in assignment to a vacant position, showed clearly that he was not interested in pursuing any option other than retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, the Board decided that if an appellant refuses to cooperate in the interactive process, an accommodation argument is not likely to succeed, <span class="Italic">Sansone v. USPS</span>, CH-0752-12-0485-I-1 (NP 6/6/2013) (Member Wagner dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, where an appellant refuses to cooperate in the interactive process, he cannot establish his disability retirement was involuntary based on an agency's alleged failure to accommodate his disability. <span class="Italic">Collins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2005) (stating that the appellant, had not established his retirement was involuntary as there was no basis for finding that the agency was obligated to continue the interactive process because, instead of responding to an accommodation proposal, the appellant submitted his application for retirement); <span class="Italic">see Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 16-18 (2010) (finding no jurisdiction in a constructive suspension appeal where the appellant could not prove he was denied a reasonable accommodation because he did not engage in good faith in the interactive process, including failing to provide requested medical documentation). The appellant admits that, when he received the RAC request for medical documentation to facilitate his parking request, he "gave up," asked his supervisor to tell the RAC "to stop pursuing this issue," and indicated his intent to request a "disability package."

<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the accommodation issue is arguably material to this appeal because a modified work schedule may have enabled the appellant to avoid the unscheduled absences in the first place, thereby relieving him of the need to document them. We also acknowledge that the appellant may have been accommodated with a modified work schedule in the past. However, we find no basis in civil service law to disturb the arbitrator's reasoned and explained finding that the appellant was at fault for failing to engage in an interactive process that might have resulted in an accommodation during the time period at issue. The arbitrator found that the agency responded to the appellant's oral accommodation request and participated in the interactive process by meeting with him, discussing the matter, and providing him forms to complete. Although we agree with the appellant that he was not required to use these forms to make his initial accommodation request, there was nothing wrong with the agency's requiring him to fill out those forms and return them to management as the next step in the interactive process. <span class="Italic">See</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Notice 915.002, Enforcement Guidance: <span class="Italic">Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Question 3</span> (Oct. 17, 2002), <span class="Italic">available at</span> <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>].

The appellant acknowledges that the agency informed him, on or about May 20, 2012, of its intention to conduct a new job search. He apparently surmised, based on the agency's previous alleged delay in providing him with an accommodation, that the agency would not perform this search promptly and that he would have to take "months of unpaid leave" in the meantime because he had exhausted all of his earned leave. He thus chose to retire just 2 weeks later to ensure that he would continue to receive some income.

<p class="Body-Text">As previously stated, the appellant failed to attend a meeting with the industrial hygienist and did not provide the agency with the medical information that it requested. Below, and on review, the appellant objected to being required to provide additional medical information to the agency. Having reviewed the record, it appears that the appellant provided the agency with two pieces of medical documentation. The first concerned her service-connected disabilities of ventricular arrhythmia and limitations in knee flexion. However, these conditions do not appear to have any bearing on the functional limitation at issue or on the accommodation that the appellant was requesting. The second was a letter from her primary care provider that essentially relayed the appellant's self-report of a suspected mold problem in her assigned office.[5] The agency promptly responded with a request for additional information, including a medical diagnosis and how the diagnosed condition might interfere with the appellant's ability to work in her assigned office. The appellant never responded to the inquiry but continued to insist that the agency had all the information that it needed to rule on her request. The agency subsequently informed the appellant that it needed her to supply medical information from "a qualified physician." We do not reach the issue of whether the appellant's treating nurse practitioner was "an appropriate health care or rehabilitation professional" to supply this information under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) official guidance. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, No. 915.002, at Question 6 (Oct. 17, 2002). Even if she were, the documentation letter that she prepared was insufficient for the agency to determine whether the appellant had a disability that needed accommodation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

Agencies are obligated to accommodate only the known limitations resulting from an employee's disability. Although an agency may inquire as to whether an employee needs an accommodation, it is generally the employee's responsibility to inform the agency that one is needed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the actions taken by management officials here reflects that they did not make the decision to remove lightly. Their efforts were clearly stymied by their attempts to follow the ambiguous and contradictory medical evidence provided by Dr. Feder and the appellant's own inconsistent statements as to whether he had medical restrictions and whether his medical condition was permanent. In fact, the appellant's treating physician--with one notable exception that he quickly invalidated--repeatedly and consistently declared that, in his medical opinion, the appellant could not perform the full range of his former duties. It was not until the Board's December 2, 2011 hearing that the appellant's physician finally made it clear through his testimony that he believed the appellant could still perform his duties, notwithstanding his many earlier medical reports that stated otherwise. This critical testimony was followed by the presentation of a medical report dated January 31, 2012, which stated unequivocally that the appellant "may return to work full duty--no restrictions." Less than two weeks thereafter, the agency returned the appellant to his former position, a few weeks before the administrative judge issued her initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's actions here were appropriate and it followed both the letter and spirit of the law by trying to keep the appellant on the rolls and trying to reasonably accommodate him. The agency's decision to remove the appellant was based on documentation provided by his treating physician, in which he stated that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his position without restrictions. The record reflects that the agency attempted to engage in the interactive process with the appellant by trying to find him jobs that he could perform.

<p class="Body-Text">The concept of the interactive process between the employer and the employee that should be followed to develop a nonapparent accommodation was described in <span class="Italic">Conaway v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant made a reasonable accommodation request when he asked to return to work within his medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">See Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17 (an employee need only let his employer know in general terms that he needs accommodation for a medical condition); <span class="Italic">EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act</span>, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html">www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>], at 5 (to make an accommodation request, an individual need only let the employer know that he needs an adjustment or change at work for a reason related to a medical condition and need not use the words "reasonable accommodation"). Having done so, the agency was required to engage in an interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation. <span class="Italic">Paris,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 17; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(3); <span class="Italic">see also EEOC Enforcement Guidance</span> at 6. The appellant, however, was also required to cooperate in the interactive process. "Both parties...have an obligation to assist in the search for an appropriate accommodation, and both have an obligation to act in good faith in doing so." <span class="Italic">Collins,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 11 (citing <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Phoenixville School District</span>, 184 F.3d 296, 312 (3 rd Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The lack of a properly interactive process will not alone serve to set aside the action. What equates to harmful error is required, <span class="Italic">Fulks v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/FULKS_MARK_CB_7121_04_0016_V_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250320.pdf">100 MSPR 228</a>, 236 &#x00B6; 18 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's remaining argument also does not provide an appropriate basis for modifying the arbitrator's decision as it concerns the discrimination claim. While the appellant has cited a court decision indicating that an agency has a duty to assist in the search for appropriate reasonable accommodation, <span class="Italic">Deane v. Pocono Medical Center</span>, 142 F.3d 138, 149 (3d Cir. 1998), nothing in that decision indicates that an agency's failure to do so may serve as the basis for finding disability discrimination, or for otherwise overturning an action. Instead, the decision indicates only that such a failure may expose the agency to the "risk that it will erroneously overlook an opportunity to accommodate a statutorily disabled employee, and thereby violate the" law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency's efforts to assist the appellant fell short of its obligations, any such deficiency was harmless, since the appellant has not identified a reasonable accommodation that it failed to implement.</p>

USDA</span>, SF-0752-13-0078-I-1 (NP 8/15/2014) ("Even assuming that the appellant informed his supervisor that he had a disability, thereby triggering the agency's obligation to engage in the interactive process, the agency's failure to engage in the interactive process alone does not violate the Rehabilitation Act; rather, the appellant must show that this omission resulted in a failure to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 16 (2010)."); <span class="Italic">Pelcher-Herring v.
