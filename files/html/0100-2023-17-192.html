<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-190"><span class="space">f.</span> Right to Determine Internal Security</h5>
<p class="noindent">Analysis of management right to control internal security was provided in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oakdale and AFGE Local 3957</span>, 59 FLRA 277, 278-79 (2003), involving a contract article, treated as an arrangement, limiting the ability of the facility to reassign correctional personnel:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency asserts that an award is contrary to management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, we apply the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA 146. Under <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, when an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106, we apply a two-prong test<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 153-54. Under prong I, we examine whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b). Under prong II, we determine whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the law or contract provision at issue. We conclude that the award affects management rights and we apply the two-prong test of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001). In agreement with the Agency, we conclude that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 18, Section r to prohibit the disputed reassignment of the grievant affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure and safeguard its personnel and physical property<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, Ga.</span>, 57 FLRA 406, 409 (2001). Where there is a link or reasonable connection between an agency's goal of safeguarding personnel or property, or preventing disruption of agency operations, and the disputed practice, the practice constitutes the agency's exercise of its right to determine internal security practices. This right specifically includes the right to determine the degree of staffing to maintain the security of the facility<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. As acknowledged by the Arbitrator, the Agency asserted that it rightfully reassigned the grievant "in order to ensure the internal security of the institution." In agreement with the Agency, we conclude that the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 18, Section r to prohibit the disputed reassignment of the grievant affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>we examine whether Article 18, Section r is enforceable as having been negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b). We conclude that the enforcement of Section r fails to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. The Union did not claim and it is not apparent that Section r was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) or (b)(2). In addition, Section r is not enforceable as having been negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether a provision is enforceable as having been negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), we assess whether the provision constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and whether its enforcement excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Transfer Ctr., Oklahoma City, Okla.</span>, 58 FLRA 109, 110 (2002) (modifying the standard under <span class="Italic">BEP </span>for determining whether a contract provision was enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)). The Arbitrator did not explain the intent or benefits of Article 18, Section r. However, even if we assumed that Article 18, Section r constituted an arrangement, we find that the award excessively interferes with management rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator interpreted and applied Article 18, Section r to prohibit the Agency from temporarily reassigning an employee unless the reassignment was reasonably related to an emergency or crisis situation. Consequently, whatever the benefits afforded employees by the quarterly roster of Section r, the award severely restricts management's right to modify shift assignments and days off in order to ensure the security of the institution and by doing so excessively interferes with management's rights to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) and to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1)<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Lompoc, Cal.</span>, 58 FLRA 301 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the award impermissibly affects management's rights to assign work and to determine its internal security practices, the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 18, Section r is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106.</p>
<p class="noindent">Applying an abrogation standard, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 57 FLRA 158, 160-62 (2001), sustained an award, over a management rights objection based on internal security, that applied a contract article concerned with the application of seniority to bids for work schedules:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure and safeguard its personnel and physical property and to prevent the disruption of the agency's activities and operations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Social Sec. Admin., Baltimore, Md., </span>55 FLRA 498, 502 (1999). When there is a link or reasonable connection between an agency's goal of safeguarding personnel or property or of preventing disruption of agency operations and the disputed practice, the Authority will find that the disputed practice constitutes the exercise by management of its right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) to determine its internal security practices. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency has established that the disputed practice of work assignments of a duration of 6 or 9 months is sufficiently linked to the goal of safeguarding personnel or property or of preventing disruption of agency operations so as to constitute an exercise of its right to determine its internal security practices.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 683, </span>30 FLRA 497, 500 (1987) (<span class="Italic">AFGE Local 683</span>) (determination of the duration of a shift rotation constituted an exercise of the agency's right to determine its internal security practices). Accordingly, by limiting the duration of work assignments to 3 months, the award affects management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Consequently, it is necessary to examine whether the award satisfies <span class="Italic">BEP.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In claiming that the award does not satisfy prong I with respect to internal security, the Agency makes two arguments. First, it repeats the claim that the provisions are not sufficiently tailored to be within the duty to bargain. Second, it claims that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the provisions "completely negates" and excessively interferes with its right to determine internal security practices. In dissent, Chairman Cabaniss would find abrogation, but, more fundamentally, asserts that the Statute requires "the use of an 'excessive interference' test to determine whether a matter violates &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, Article 3 and Article 18 were negotiated to ameliorate the effects of the exercise of management rights and have been applied by the Arbitrator to redress only those employees who were adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. Accordingly, we conclude that the provisions constitute arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute for employees adversely affected by management's right to determine its internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R5-82, </span>43 FLRA 25, 39 (1991) (provision limiting the duration of details to ensure fairness constituted an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the argument that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the provisions completely negated its decision on a security issue. The award merely requires the Agency to adhere to its agreement to use 3-month rotations. It does not preclude management from adopting other measures to address the "control of potentially dangerous and manipulative inmates." Therefore, the award does not abrogate or completely negate management's right. <span class="Italic">See Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314 (an award that abrogates a management right is an award that "precludes" management from exercising the right); <span class="Italic">cf. AFGE Local 3302, </span><span id="page_2020"></span>37 FLRA 350, 360 (1990) (proposal 3) (proposal did not "totally negate" management's right because it did not "preclude" management from supplementing its internal security practices by adopting other measures to address the problem of disruptive clients).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague would find abrogation because of the special security considerations attendant to Federal correctional facilities.&#x2003;We disagree. We find no abrogation even considering security concerns. Accordingly, we conclude that Article 3 and Article 18 constitute contract provisions negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and that the award satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject any reliance on an excessive interference standard in claiming that the provisions impermissibly affect management's right to determine its internal security practices. The Authority has specifically held in applying the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework that "negotiability cases employing an 'interference' analysis do not control the abrogation analysis required under <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service." See FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 1237; <span class="Italic">see also Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service, </span>37 FLRA at 313-16 (refusing to apply an excessive interference standard prior to <span class="Italic">BEP</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, for the past 11 years, <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> has provided the uncontested approach of the Authority to the question of whether an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Specifically, the Authority has uniformly ruled that when an arbitrator has enforced an arrangement negotiated by the parties in a manner that does not abrogate the exercise of a management right, the enforcement is consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. In view of this settled approach and the fact that the Agency has not asked us to reexamine <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service, </span>we see no reason to depart from this well-established precedent in this case. Accordingly, we reaffirm the holding in <span class="Italic">FAA,</span> 55 FLRA at 1237, in which our dissenting colleague joined, that "negotiability cases employing an 'interference' analysis do not control the abrogation analysis required under <span class="Italic">Customs Service."</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we are persuaded that abrogation remains the correct analysis when resolving exceptions to arbitration awards. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service, </span>the Authority recognized that under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1), the question for determination is whether the award is contrary to law, namely &#x00A7; 7106. The Authority found this determination to be fundamentally different from the issue and determination of the extent of the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7117 of the Statute. For these reasons, the Authority determined that it would "not apply the test established in<span class="Italic"> KANG </span>to determine whether the provision excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. This is a matter for the negotiation process under the Statute." 37 FLRA at 314. The Authority explained that this approach "more fully carries out the purposes of the Statute because it recognizes the fundamental differences under the Statute between the process for negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement and the process for enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 315.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In establishing the <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>framework, the Authority adhered to the legal principle of &#x00A7; 7106 that management rights cannot be waived. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 316. Restating the waiver principle in terms of an enforcement standard, the Authority concluded that "[s]ection 7106 prohibits an agency from agreeing to a provision that abrogates management's rights<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The Authority ruled that it would "examine the award for abrogation because an award that abrogates, that is, precludes an agency from exercising, a management right inherently cannot constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3)<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 314. The Authority explained that "[i]f it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Simply stated, a provision that abrogates the exercise of a management right is unenforceable in all circumstances because it constitutes the waiver of the right and, as a result, is contrary to law. Short of abrogation, however, parties are free to agree to provisions (even if they would not otherwise be required to bargain over them) and, once agreement is reached, the provisions are enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">Customs Service,</span> parties should assess during bargaining the effect of the provision on management's rights and the benefits to employees from the provision. In other words, employers and unions should determine, through the collective bargaining process, what provisions best fit their working conditions and what arrangements are "appropriate." Thus, <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>reflects a justifiable reluctance on the part of the Authority to substitute its judgment on the wisdom of bargaining, or the merits of particular terms, for that of the parties who have reached agreement on the contract provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our dissenting colleague has noted that when provisions have been disapproved under &#x00A7; 7114(c) the dispositive question is not whether the provision is within the duty to bargain, but like the question under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1), whether the provision is "in accordance with" law, rule, or regulation. In this regard, both sections require compliance with applicable laws. In considering this point, we conclude that for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Custom Service, </span>the Authority should be reluctant to substitute its judgment for the wisdom of the parties who have reached agreement on the appropriateness of an arrangement, provided the provision constitutes an arrangement and does not abrogate the exercise of any management right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, contrary to the view of the dissent, the Authority does not provide arbitrators deference when none is permitted in the <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review of exceptions contending that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106. Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service, </span>the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo </span>the legal standard applicable to the assessment of whether an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision consistent with &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). As clearly reflected by <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Def., Def. Mapping Agency Aerospace</span> <span class="Italic">Ctr., St. Louis, Mo., </span>39 FLRA 286 (1991), the Authority does not defer to the arbitrator's legal conclusions under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As relevant here, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's determination of what a contract provision means, not whether, given that interpretation, the provision is enforceable.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The right to determine internal security practices includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks.[17] If an agency fails to demonstrate a reasonable connection between a disputed practice and the agency's security objective, the Authority will find that management's right to determine its internal security practices is not affected.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency argues that its security decisions are entitled to a "higher standard of deference," and the Arbitrator should have deferred to the Agency's decision to prohibit the grievant from returning to work until her seizures subsided.[19] According to the Agency, by permitting the grievant to return to work, the award interferes with the Agency's policy of "not having employees within the secure perimeter of the institution if they are not able to respond to emergencies."[20]</p>

Because the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant could have worked in the computer lab without creating a security risk, we defer to that finding.[23] Consequently, the Agency has failed to establish a reasonable connection between its denial of the grievant's reasonable-accommodation request and the Agency's alleged security objective.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award affects its right to determine its internal security practices.&#x2003;The right to determine internal security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the policies and practices that are part of an agency's plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, or operations against internal or external risks.[32] Where an agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its security objective and a policy or practice designed to implement that objective, an award that conflicts with that policy or practice affects management's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1).[33] However, if an agency fails to demonstrate a reasonable connection between its practice and its security objective, then the Authority will find that management's right to determine its internal security practices is not affected.[34] Furthermore, the Authority has held that implementation of a drug testing program constitutes an exercise of management's right to determine its internal security practices.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that, in granting the Union immediate access to the annotated test list, the award "directly infringes upon the integrity of the Agency's substance testing process, and therefore is in conflict with the Agency's internal security objective." Although the Agency assumes that providing the annotated test list to the Union affects the integrity of the testing program, the Arbitrator found, as a factual matter, that it did not. The Arbitrator stated that the Agency "offer[ed] no compelling reason for the slow and deliberate procedure" that caused a delay in giving the annotated test list to the Union. Specifically addressing the argument that employees would misuse the information and affect the integrity of the testing process, the Arbitrator rejected this argument, finding that "[t]he evidence offered in support of this theory was not convincing." In short, the Arbitrator found that providing the annotated test list to the Union at the end of a testing day did not affect the Agency's implementation of its drug testing program. Because the Agency did not challenge the Arbitrator's factual findings as nonfacts, we defer to them.[39] Consequently, the Agency has failed to demonstrate a reasonable connection between the timing of giving the annotated test list to the Union and the Agency's security objective.[40]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;Member Pizzella notes that contracts have consequences. An agency should use better judgment when drafting and negotiating provisions and should not, as here, attempt to use its exceptions to wriggle out of a poorly thought out and constructed contract provision.

<p class="noindent">A remand for redetermination of a remedy resulted when an arbitrator failed to apply OPM regulations governing issuance of personal identity verification (PIV) cards, <span class="Italic">VA St. Petersburg Reg'l Benefit Office and AFGE Local 1594</span>, 70 FLRA 1, 4-5 (2016) (Member Pizzella concurring and dissenting) (following remand, 70 FLRA 586 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>, recon. den., 71 FLRA 1 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting))::</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to government-wide rules and regulations found in HSPD-12 and the OPM Memo. In particular, the Agency contends that HSPD-12 and the OPM Memo mandate adherence to "credentialing standards" that "require...that the individual undergo an appropriate background investigation, be fingerprinted, and present two acceptable forms of identity source documents" before receiving a PIV card.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">HSPD-12 announced a policy for "establishing a mandatory, [g]overnment-wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the [f]ederal [g]overnment to its employees." Under the authority granted in HSPD-12, OPM released credentialing standards for issuing PIV cards. There is no dispute that these standards constitute government-wide regulations, for purposes of our review. As part of these standards, agencies must "initiate a background investigation...and ensure the [Federal Bureau of Investigation] fingerprint check is completed before issuing an identity credential."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the Union vice president "shall be granted a PIV card," without regard to these credentialing standards. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's remedy of granting the Union vice president a PIV card is contrary to government-wide regulations, and we set aside that remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">The St. Petersburg Regional Benefits Office once again found itself before FLRA when the arbitrator again considered whether VA could, based on security concerns, decline to permit a terminated union official to be sponsored for a PIV card. Again FLRA set aside an award directing VA to pursue the credentialing process. The VA's ability to determine its internal security was not subject to arbitral review, <span class="Italic">VA St. Petersburg Reg'l Benefit Office and AFGE Local 1594</span>, 70 FLRA 586, 588-89 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., 71 FLRA 1 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA I</span>, the Authority struck the remedy at issue--an order that the Agency issue the vice president a PIV card--because the Arbitrator issued that remedy without regard to the credentialing standards set forth in government-wide regulations. With respect to the remedy now before us, we find that the Arbitrator again reached legal conclusions that are contrary to government-wide regulation--specifically, the OPM Memo.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OPM Memo provides, initially, six reasons for a PIV card to not be issued to an individual. After this list, the Memo continues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Many departments and agencies work with individuals who do not require a suitability determination or a security clearance. In such cases, agencies have the flexibility to apply supplemental credentialing standards in addition to the six basic standards above. The supplemental standards are intended to ensure that the grant <span id="page_2022"></span>of a PIV card to an individual does not create an unacceptable risk. ...These standards may be applied based on the risk associated with the position or work on the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OPM Memo then lists seven more standards available to agencies so that "[a] department or agency may consider denying or revoking a PIV card to an individual based on one of these supplemental credentialing standards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the OPM Memo provides to departments and agencies, already charged with providing PIV cards themselves, the discretion and the authority alone to determine who presents security risks and, therefore, should not even have access to the PIV-credentialing process.[29] We cannot reconcile this discretion and authority with the Arbitrator's sweeping determinations that led to his conclusions and remedy in the remand award.[30] The Arbitrator concluded that the security concerns, testified to by the Agency official in charge of credentialing, were "not for any security reasons" and so, he ordered that the Union vice president be provided with a sponsor and put through the credentialing process "like other non-employee [a]ffiliates." While we acknowledge the well-established discretion that our own case law has provided to arbitrators to fashion remedies for violations, our review of the OPM Memo does not allow us to go so far as to permit an arbitrator to require an agency to activate the PIV-credentialing process. To hold otherwise would run counter to the very premise underlying that process itself--specifically, that agencies alone have the discretion and the authority to determine which individuals pose security risks that warrant not submitting them to the process.[32] And so, we find the remand award contrary to law and we set it aside.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;We note that the dissent takes an extraordinarily broad view of the restrictions that collective-bargaining may place on, and takes a disproportionally narrow view of an Agency's right to determine, who may access an Agency's facilities. We take seriously the increasingly frequent scoldings that the Authority has received from the courts for its failure to give due consideration to the discretion and responsibilities held by other agencies when they interpret other statutes not our own. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Ariz. v. FLRA</span>, 844 F.3d 957, 961 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (noting the court "cannot imagine that Congress intended to empower a civilian agency like the Federal Labor Relations Authority to second-guess the military's judgment about non-military access to commissaries and exchanges); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Navy v. FLRA,</span> 665 F.3d 1339, 1348 (D.C. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 32</span>, 29 FLRA 380, 417 (1987) (Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of Member Frazier) ("precious little deference"). Without a doubt, the Authority has long recognized, and still does today, the prerogative and necessity of federal unions to select their own officials and the importance of assuring access between federal unions and the bargaining unit employees they represent. With that said, the Authority has never held (and may not hold) that any particular union official can unilaterally demand entry into controlled-access agency facilities, or the manner in which the agency will exercise its right to determine who is entitled to access credentials, without any regard to OPM's or another agency's national security-based edicts. We do not consider national security requirements to be equal to the use of a telephone or access to scheduling systems, examples upon which the dissent relies. Simply put, there is sound public policy behind the discretion which agencies are given in making security determinations and that policy and those rights cannot be compromised by a collective-bargaining provision.</p>
