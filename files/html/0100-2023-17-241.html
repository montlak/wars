<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-239"><span class="space">i.</span> Standby Pay</h5>
<p class="noindent">Standby pay is authorized by 5 CFR 551.431 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Time spent on standby duty or in an on-call status.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;(1)&#x2003;An employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-related reasons, the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty and is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employee's activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effectively for his or her own purposes. A finding that an employee's activities are substantially limited may not be based on the fact that an employee is <span id="page_2136"></span>subject to restrictions necessary to ensure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and responsibilities, such as restrictions on alcohol consumption or use of certain medications.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An employee is not considered restricted for "work-related reasons" if, for example, the employee remains at the post of duty voluntarily, or if the restriction is a natural result of geographic isolation or the fact that the employee resides on the agency's premises. For example, in the case of an employee assigned to work in a remote wildland area or on a ship, the fact that the employee has limited mobility when relieved from duty would not be a basis for finding that the employee is restricted for work-related reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;An employee will be considered off duty and time spent in an on-call status shall not be considered hours of work if:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;The employee is allowed to leave a telephone number or to carry an electronic device for the purpose of being contacted, even though the employee is required to remain within a reasonable call-back radius; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The employee is allowed to make arrangements such that any work which may arise during the on-call period will be performed by another person.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA touched on some of the regulatory requirements for standby pay, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1897 and Dept. of Air Force, Elgin AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 1290, 1291-92 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Union challenges the award's consistency with a Government-wide regulation, we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the question of whether the award is inconsistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 establishes criteria for determining when an employee is in a standby (paid) or an on-call (unpaid) status. As relevant here, in order to be in a standby status under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), three criteria must be satisfied: the employee must be restricted to his or her designated post of duty, have his or her activities substantially limited, and be in a state of readiness to perform work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Marine Corps, Locals (C-240) and U.S. Department of the Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, D.C.</span>, 39 FLRA 773, 778-79 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 962 F.2d 1066 (D.C. Cir. 1992). If these criteria are not satisfied, the fact that the employee is required to carry a beeper and remain within a reasonable call-back radius from the employing agency does not thereby change the employee's status from on-call to standby. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 779. In fact, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 precludes an employee in an on-call status from being paid regardless of whether the employee must carry or respond to a beeper.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 to this case, that the Arbitrator properly concluded that the grievants did not meet the requirements for standby pay and, rather, that they met both criteria pertaining to on-call status set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551.431(b). First, the Union incorrectly argues that the grievants were within their designated post of duty when they were required to remain within the range of their beepers and that, therefore, they were in standby status. Rather, as the Arbitrator found, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(b)(1) precludes standby pay for employees who are permitted to carry beepers and required to remain within a reasonable call-back radius. Accordingly, we conclude that the Union has failed to establish that the award is deficient in this respect. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S.</span>, 1 Cl. Ct. 649, 651-52 (1983). Second, it is uncontroverted that at least some of the grievants had arranged to exchange their on-call duties with other employees. Nothing in the language of the governing regulation limits the application of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(b)(2) solely to situations in which such arrangements are made without consultation with management, as suggested by the Union. Accordingly, as the Union has also failed to establish that the award is deficient in this respect, we will deny the Union's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Authority has previously determined that compensation for time spent in a standby status is provided for under both 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545 and under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542. <span class="Italic">See DOJ</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 44 FLRA at 351-52. As explained in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS </span>there are two independent provisions authorizing standby pay. The provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.141-143, implementing standby pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(1), provide for up to a 25 percent premium for "regular," annualized standby (non-FLSA) pay. The provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 implement standby pay under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.101. Compensation for standby duty under the FLSA is either regular pay or overtime pay at the rate of time and a half.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Agency stipulated that the grievants are nonexempt FLSA employees and the parties have consistently addressed the merits of the standby pay issue under the FLSA. Accordingly, in addition to the availability of standby pay under section 5545, the law and regulations governing standby duty under the FLSA also are applicable. By law, such employees are to receive pay under whichever pay system provides the greater entitlement--section 5545 or under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.513. In this case, whether or not overtime for the grievants was approved by OPM under section 5545(c), overtime pay for standby duty was available to them under the FLSA, provided the circumstances set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(1) or (a)(2) are fulfilled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FLSA and its implementing regulations provide overtime pay for standby duty for the employees here, the Agency's reliance on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(1) and its implementing regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.141-143 is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Award is Not Contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 establishes criteria for determining when an employee is in a standby (paid) or an on-call (unpaid) duty status. As relevant here, in order to be in a standby duty status under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), three criteria must be satisfied: (1) the employee must be restricted to his or her designated post of duty; (2) have his or her activities substantially limited; and (3) be in a state of readiness to perform work<span class="Italic">. See American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 1897 and U.S. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, </span>51 FLRA 1290, 1291-92 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Eglin Air Force Base). </span>The Arbitrator, in applying the provisions contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), specifically found that the grievants served in a standby duty status....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator based his conclusions that the employees who had timely filed grievances were entitled to standby duty pay on specific findings of fact. First, the Arbitrator found that the "designated post of duty [to which the grievants are restricted] is the ship to which the [grievants] are assigned and where they perform...work[.]" The Arbitrator also noted that not only are the grievants' "activities substantially limited" by the geographical fact that they are at sea, but they are also precluded from consuming alcohol or sleep-inducing medication as it would inhibit their ability to promptly respond when called upon. Finally, the Arbitrator determined that the grievants are required to remain in a state of readiness at all times, as they are "called back after their regular duty hours with a high degree of frequency in order to perform essential work...[and their] response must be immediate [as] no one else on board the ship can take the [grievants'] place[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the Arbitrator's specific factual findings, to which we defer, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievants were in a standby duty status is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), and the case law interpreting such regulation. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 50 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Carolina District, Charlotte, North Carolina, </span>54 FLRA 250, 255 (1998) (the Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact). Consequently, the award does not conflict with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), and therefore, is not deficient under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;Limiting the Retroactive Award of Backpay to the Date of the Filing of the Grievances Is Contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the award is contrary to section 255(a) because the Arbitrator limited the time period for the recovery of backpay to the filing date of the grievances. According to the Union, that provision requires the application of either a 6-year statute of limitations under the Barring Act, as applied by the Authority previously, or the 2-year or 3-year statute of limitations as set forth under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1485 (1998) <span class="Italic">(FDIC), </span>the Authority determined that the FLSA statute of limitations set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) applies to an award of backpay for a claim brought under the FLSA.[6] The Authority determined that it would "no longer follow <span class="Italic">SSA II </span>and its progeny to the extent this precedent holds that an arbitrator, resolving a claim brought under the FLSA, is not bound to apply 29 USC &#x00A7; 255(a) to an award of backpay." <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>53 FLRA at 1485.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) entitled, "<span class="Italic">Statute of Limitations</span>," provides that any action begun under the FLSA "may be commenced within two years after the cause of action accrued,...except that a cause of action arising out of a willful violation may be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrued[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching the above decision, the Authority made several findings that serve as benchmarks in the instant case. In particular, the Authority found that: (1) nothing in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs </span>indicates that the Back Pay Act, and not the FLSA, applies to remedies for violations of the FLSA; (2) "[b]ecause the FLSA itself is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and independently provides a statutory right to money damages,...[t]he application of the Back Pay Act is not necessary to award backpay for violations of the FLSA"; <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>53 FLRA at 1488; and (3) reducing the grievants' period of recovery, by ignoring the FLSA statute of limitations, deprives the grievants' of their statutory right to recover for either a full 2-year or 3-year period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2137"></span>Consistent with the foregoing, the award limiting the recovery period for backpay to the filing date of the grievances is contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because the Arbitrator did not apply the recovery period under the FLSA, the Arbitrator did not make any findings of fact on the issue of willfulness on the part of the Agency as pertinent to the 2-year or 3-year statute of limitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's ability to review <span class="Italic">de novo </span>the legal conclusions arrived at in an award is dependent on the sufficiency of the record before it. <span class="Italic">Army Research,</span> 53 FLRA at 1710. When an award fails to contain factual findings necessary to assess an arbitrator's legal conclusions, and the findings cannot be derived from the record, the award will be set aside and the case remanded to the parties for submission to the arbitrator so that the requisite findings can be made. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, because the Arbitrator did not make any findings of fact on the issue of willfulness, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a determination as to the appropriate statute of limitation under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to be applied in computing the award of backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Liquidated Damages Under the FLSA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, the Authority will not consider issues that could have been, but were not, presented to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3295 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Thrift Supervision, Washington, D.C., </span>51 FLRA 27, 32 (1995). There is no indication in the record that the Union argued to the Arbitrator, as it has in its exceptions, that the FLSA provides an entitlement to liquidated damages in addition to backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, under the FLSA, liquidated damages may be awarded in addition to monies owed employees for unpaid overtime compensation<span class="Italic">. See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b). An employee is not required to plead or specifically request liquidated damages when seeking relief under the FLSA. However, although liquidated damages are presumed, they may be reduced or eliminated if an employer shows that it acted in good faith and reasonableness when it nevertheless violated the FLSA<span class="Italic">. See Reich v. Tiller Helicopter Services, Inc., </span>8 F.3d 1018, 1030-31 (5th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </span>567 F.2d 429, 463-65 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, we have determined that this case must be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for a determination as to the appropriate statute of limitations under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) to be applied in computing the award of backpay. To make that determination, the Arbitrator must find whether the Agency's violation of the FLSA constituted a willful violation. In conducting his inquiry to arrive at that determination, the Arbitrator must conclude whether the Agency acted in good faith and reasonableness or whether the violation was willful. Therefore, we will remand the issue of liquidated damages to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine whether liquidated damages should be awarded to the grievants, and whether such liquidated damages, if any, should be limited or reduced based on the Agency's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, St. Louis and AFGE Local 96</span>, 57 FLRA 296, 297-98 &#x0026; n.2 (2001) (enforcing award directing back pay when agency failed to adhere to contract provision stating that "[e]mployees will not be required to stay at home or wear and respond to beepers/pagers unless they are in a pay status").</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of standby time was set aside because it was not ordered or required by the agency or necessitated by an assignment placing the appellant in geographical isolation but not requiring him to remain available for work after regular hours. The award was contrary to regulatory provisions concerning standby time, 5 CFR 550.143(a)(1) and guidance from the late FPM. <span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 15 FLRA 445, 447 (1984). The same result occurred in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Evans Army Community Hosp. and AFGE Local 1345</span>, 58 FLRA 244, 245-46 (2002), determining that employees who can leave their living quarters but remain within telephone contact are ineligible for standby pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award of standby pay is contrary to &#x00A7; 141, which authorizes agencies to pay employees standby pay if the employees are in "position[s] requiring [them] regularly to remain at, or within the confines of, [their] duty station[s] during longer than ordinary periods of duty." In order to meet this requirement, "the employees must be officially ordered to remain at [their] station[s]." &#x00A7; 143(a). <span class="Italic">Accord Huskey v. Trujillo, </span>302 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2002) <span class="Italic">(Huskey); United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Air Station,</span> <span class="Italic">Corpus Christi, Tex., </span>36 FLRA 935, 940 (1990). Employees who are in their living quarters while on-call are considered "at, or within the confines of his station," only when their living quarters are "designated by the agency as his duty station and when his whereabouts is narrowly limited and his activities are substantially restricted." &#x00A7; 143(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Accord Huskey</span>, 302 F.3d at 1312. Employees are not "narrowly limited" or their activities "substantially restricted" where they "may leave his quarters provided he arrange[s] for someone else to respond to calls or leave[s] a telephone number by which he can be reached should his services be required." &#x00A7; 143(b)(3). <span class="Italic">Accord, e.g., Sheets v. United States, </span>2 Cl. Ct. 101, 103-04 (1983). The fact that employees are required to return to their duty stations within thirty minutes does not, by itself, support an award of standby pay. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Huskey, </span>302 F.3d at 1312-13.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found, and it is undisputed, that the Agency has not officially designated the grievants' living quarters as their duty stations. The Arbitrator also found, and it is undisputed, that the grievants are permitted to leave their living quarters if they arrange for someone else to respond to calls or leave a phone number where they can be reached. Thus, the employees were not "at, or within the confines of," their duty stations within the meaning of &#x00A7; 141. Although the Arbitrator found that the employees are required to return to work within thirty minutes of being called, that does not support standby pay. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">A decision hinging on the necessity for standby pay to be based on OPM regulations effective in 2000 that tied the payment to restriction of employees to a designated post of duty is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Elgin AFB and AFGE Local 1897</span>, 65 FLRA 908, 908-10 (2011) (recon. den., 65 FLRA 1047 (2011)), also determining that a contract could not create an entitlement to standby pay on a basis other than OPM regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the onset of Hurricane Ida, the Agency sent an e-mail to security personnel (Agency e-mail), notifying them that they were being placed on "[Six]-Ring Stand-By[,]" i.e., they were required to "answer [the] phone within [six] [r]ing[s] to receive instructions[.]" The e-mail also stated that security personnel were to: (1) "be contactable at all time"; (2) have an "alternate number where your unit can reach you during a recall"; (3) refrain from going "hunting, camping or out of town"; (4) know that "even having a cell phone with you is no guarantee of contact-ability"; and (5) refrain from consuming alcohol.<span class="Italic"> </span>The next day, the Agency issued a directive stating that certain employees would "[r]emain on [one]-hour standby after [the] hurricane passes, for possible [twenty-four] hour emergency recovery operations." Approximately three weeks later, the Agency directed supervisors to "inform...personnel that we are no longer on six ring standby."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency violated Article 36.03 of the parties' agreement (Article 36.03),[1] and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 (&#x00A7; 551.431),[2] by failing to pay security personnel for time spent on standby. The matter was unresolved and was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Article 36.03, entitled "STANDBY TIME[,]" states:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Designated employees may be restricted to the official duty station or their living quarters, required to remain in a state of readiness to perform work, and have their activities substantially limited such that they cannot use the time effectively for their own purposes. In these situations, all time spent on standby is considered hours of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;As relevant here, &#x00A7; 551.431 pertains to time on standby that is considered hours of work for overtime pay purposes. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 750, 752 (2006). Section 551.431 states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)(1) An employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-related reasons, the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty and is assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work with limitations on the employee's activities so substantial that the employee cannot use the time effectively for his or her own purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 551.431 states, in pertinent part, that "[a]n employee is on duty, and time spent on standby duty is hours of work if, for work-related reasons, the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. That is, an employee must be restricted to a "designated post of duty" in order to be on standby under &#x00A7; 551.431. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Unlike the former version of &#x00A7; 551.431 (which was not in effect at any times relevant here), <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 (1999), and unlike Article 36.03, which uses wording similar to the wording in the former version of &#x00A7; 551.431, the current version of &#x00A7; 551.431 does not provide that an employee may be on standby if restricted to his or her "living quarters." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. As such, the fact that security personnel were restricted to their homes, i.e., their living quarters, does not indicate that security personnel were on standby, as the Union argues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that security personnel were on standby without finding that security personnel were restricted to a designated post of duty, as required under &#x00A7; 551.431. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Nat'l Oceanic &#x0026; Atmospheric Admin., Office of NOAA Corps Operations, Atl. Marine Ctr., Norfolk, Va.</span>, 55 FLRA 816, 820-21 (1999) (Chair Segal concurring; Member Wasserman dissenting) (arbitrator expressly found that grievants were restricted to a designated post of duty). Further, with regard to the Union's argument that the Agency restricted security personnel to their homes and were therefore on standby, the Arbitrator did not find, and there is no claim, that security personnel's homes constitute a "designated post of duty" under &#x00A7; 551.431. Accordingly, <span id="page_2138"></span>we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion that security personnel were on standby is contrary to &#x00A7; 551.431.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Arbitrator's reliance on Article 36.03, the Authority has held that parties may not negotiate over proposals that would entitle employees to standby pay unless such pay would be consistent with the requirements of &#x00A7; 551.431. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Dall., Tex.</span>, 64 FLRA 603, 605 (2010) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>). As Article 36.03 permits standby pay to be granted to an employee who is restricted to his or her "living quarters" without regard to whether the employee is restricted to a "designated post of duty," Article 36.03 is not consistent with the requirements of &#x00A7; 551.431 and, thus, cannot provide a basis for the Arbitrator's award of standby pay. <span class="Italic">See DHS</span>, 64 FLRA at 605. <span class="Italic">See also Soc.

<p class="noindent">That an employee is required to carry an electronic paging device does not establish entitlement to standby duty pay, <span class="Italic">DHS, Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Dallas and NTEU Chap. 140</span>, 64 FLRA 603, 604-05 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(1), an employee's standby duty is considered hours of work under the FLSA if the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty, assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work, and substantially limited in the use of his or her time. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Locals 2544 &#x0026; 2595,</span> 62 FLRA 428, 431 (2008). An employee's activities may not be found "substantially limited" merely because the employee is subject to restrictions necessary to ensure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and responsibilities, such as restricting alcohol consumption or the use of certain medicines. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As the Office of Personnel Management explained in promulgating &#x00A7; 551.431, "[i]f an employee is relieved from duty and free to pursue personal activities (though, for practical reasons, limited in where he or she may go), the employee is not in a duty status and the hours are not compensable...[t]he fact that some restrictions may be placed on an employee's personal activities does not mean that the employee must be placed in duty status." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting 64 Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The mere fact that an employee is required to carry an electronic paging device does not place the employee in standby duty within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431; in fact, that regulation "precludes an employee in an on-call status from being paid regardless of whether the employee must carry or respond to a beeper." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1897,</span> 51 FLRA 1290, 1292 (1996).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement to require the Agency to pay the employee for any time during which he was required to carry a cellular phone. The Arbitrator did not find that the agreement entitled the employee to pay only when his activities were substantially limited, as the FLSA requires. Although the Arbitrator did find that the employee was required to respond to calls within fifteen minutes, as discussed above, this alone did not entitle the employee to pay under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bright,</span> 934 F.2d at 677.

<p class="noindent">Standby pay was treated in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l INS Council</span>, 44 FLRA 343, 351-55 (1992), setting aside an arbitrator's grant of the premium:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note that compensation for time spent in a standby status is not restricted only to the provisions contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(1). That statutory authority permits agencies to pay premium pay up to 25 percent of employees' base pay on an annual basis, instead of overtime compensation, to employees for regularly scheduled duty spent on standby status.... The Agency concedes, as to the grievants in this case, that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a) also provides a basis for compensation for time spent in a standby status. Therefore, we reject the Agency's assertion that the award is deficient because the requisite authorization and approval for standby pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545(c)(1) did not exist to warrant an award of compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Previously, in <span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Virginia and Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO</span>, 15 FLRA 445 (1984) (<span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base</span>), the Authority noted that standby time, which is compensable as hours of work under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a), is defined in Federal Personnel Management (FPM) Supplement 990-2, Book 610, subchapter S1-3d. That section provides, in relevant part, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Standby time consists of periods in which an employee is officially ordered to remain at or within the confines of his station, not performing actual work but holding himself in readiness to perform actual work when the need arises or when called.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not specifically address this regulatory provision or the appropriate statutory authorization for standby pay.&#x2003;Instead, the Arbitrator examined the provisions contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431, governing standby pay under the FLSA, and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.141-143, essentially governing non-FLSA standby pay. Although the Arbitrator applied each set of regulations, he ultimately awarded compensation based on the non-FLSA regulations. Consequently, we will examine the sufficiency of the award in the context of the non-FLSA regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The requirement that employees be officially ordered to remain at their stations and hold themselves in readiness to perform work, for purposes of defining hours of work as set forth above, is also contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.143 for purposes of pay administration. The Arbitrator applied section 550.143(b)(2) to find that the grievants "were 'regularly at' the living quarters provided by the Agency." However, the Arbitrator did not make a definitive finding that the grievants met the requirement to "stand by in readiness to perform actual work when the need arises or when called." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.143(b)(2). In this connection, the Arbitrator found that "[s]ince no specific instructions were outlined to the Grievants, it had to be assumed that it was understood by both parties that the Grievants...could be readily reached at their living quarters, while in a state of readiness to return to work." The only other finding made by the Arbitrator with respect to the requirement that employees stand by in readiness to perform work was based on the grievant testimony that "mentally they were alerted to be called back to their work state at any time." In our view, these findings do not support the conclusion that the grievants were required to stand by in readiness to perform actual work. The Arbitrator's finding that the notices from the Agency to the Bureau of Prisons pertaining to the details "constituted a 'definite order' to remain at one's station," do not compel a different conclusion. Those notices did not refer to standby or require employees to be in a state of readiness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is similar, in many respects, to situations previously addressed by the Authority in which claims for standby duty pay were denied. In <span class="Italic">Naval Amphibious Base</span>, for example, the Authority reversed an arbitrator's award that had ordered standby pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542 to an employee who was assigned to perform repair work on an isolated island. The Authority rejected the arbitrator's finding that the employee was on standby because he was confined to the island after completing his work and, thereby, was compelled to hold himself in readiness to perform additional work. The Authority found that the employee had not been officially ordered or required to be on standby or to hold himself in readiness to perform additional work and, further, that standby status does not result solely from geographic isolation. In reaching its decision, the Authority also cited an earlier case adopting an administrative law judge's finding that an agency was not obligated to bargain over the decision to change a practice of paying overtime to employees who were stranded offshore overnight where the employees were not required to hold themselves in readiness to perform work in a standby status. The Authority agreed with the judge's finding that there was no obligation to bargain over the decision to change the practice because the change was effected to conform with the legal and regulatory requirements governing overtime pay....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, both the United States Claims Court and the Comptroller General have refused to sustain claims of compensation for time assertedly spent on standby duty in circumstances that were more restrictive than are present here in terms of various limitations imposed on employees. For example, in <span class="Italic">Aldridge v. United States</span>, 479 F.2d 1365 (Ct. Cl. 1973), the court held that civilian policemen employed by the <span id="page_2139"></span>U.S. Government in the Panama Canal Zone who, during a period of unrest, were restricted in their off-duty hours to a particular area and were required to remain at their quarters or at some place within the area where they could be reached by telephone, were not on standby duty during such time. The court noted that the employees had not been ordered to remain in their regular duty station or living quarters and were free to go anywhere during their off-duty time as long as they remained in the particular area and maintained telephone contact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in 57 Comp. Gen. 496, the Comptroller General held that an employee who was required to remain overnight at a remote radar site was not in a standby status, noting the absence of evidence that employees at the facility were required to hold themselves in a state of readiness to perform work during nonduty hours. The Comptroller General stated that the regulations authorizing compensation for time spent in a standby status apply when an employee is required to hold himself in a state of readiness to perform work and not when there is a "mere restriction of an employee to his worksite outside of duty hours...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 499. The Comptroller General also distinguished the case from a situation in which employees of the same agency who were required to remain overnight at a remote facility were found to be in a compensable standby duty status. B-170264 (unpublished) (December 21, 1973). The Comptroller General found, in the latter case, that the facility did not have on-duty coverage for 24 hours per day and that the employees were required to hold themselves in readiness to perform work in order to provide needed coverage. By contrast, there was 24-hour on-duty coverage in the former case and, as noted, the employees were not required to hold themselves in a state of readiness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, as we stated above, the Arbitrator's finding that the employees were in a state of readiness does not comport with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements governing standby pay. There is no evidence, for example, that round-the-clock coverage by the grievant was needed at the prison facility and no evidence that the Agency required the grievant to remain in a state of readiness. Under such circumstances, we find that the grievant was not entitled to standby pay under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5542(a). Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award of compensation is deficient and will be set aside....</p>
<p class="noindent">An award of standby pay was set aside because the employees were not required to be in constant readiness to receive assignments, despite their geographical isolation and the need to respond to occasional emergencies during their off-duty hours, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DHS, C&#x0026;BP, Yuma &#x0026; Tucson Sectors,</span> 62 FLRA 428, 428, 431-32 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a dispute over whether United States Border Patrol Agents (Agents) patrolling the U.S. Border with Mexico at remote locations are entitled to standby pay. In 2002, the Agency established trailer camps to patrol the large, desolate region just north of the Arizona/Mexico border. The camps are located in rocky desert areas with rough terrain, approximately an hour and a half to three hours from the nearest border patrol stations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agents voluntarily sign up for tours of duty at the camps, which last about seven days. While at the camps, Agents are not permitted to possess or drink alcohol or wear clothing violating Equal Employment Opportunity requirements.<span class="Italic"> </span>Agents are also prohibited from bringing personally owned vehicles to the camps and must request permission from their supervisors to leave. Civilian visitors are not allowed at the camps and there is little or no cell phone service, and no Internet or postal service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 551.431(a)(1) provides that standby duty is considered hours of work under the FLSA if the employee is restricted by official order to a designated post of duty, assigned to be in a state of readiness to perform work, and substantially limited in the use of this time. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(1). An employee's activities may not be found "substantially limited" merely because the employee is subject to restrictions necessary to ensure that the employee will be able to perform his or her duties and responsibilities, such as restricting alcohol consumption or the use of certain medications. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Further, employees are not considered restricted for "work-related reasons" if the restriction is a natural result of geographic isolation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(1) and (2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the Agents met the requirements to be considered on standby duty during their off-duty hours, finding that the Agents are: (1) restricted to the camps by official order; (2) substantially limited in their activities at the camps; and (3) required to remain in a state of readiness while at the camps. With regard to the second factor, in concluding that the Agents are substantially limited in their activities at the camp, the Arbitrator found that during non-duty time, Agents have the opportunity to change out of their uniforms and into civilian clothes, relax, exercise, shower, cook, eat, read, watch TV/DVDs, play games, socialize amongst themselves, and/or sleep, all without the interruption of their handheld radios, which can be switched off during this time. Despite the foregoing, the Arbitrator determined that the Agents' activities are substantially limited because the Agency wants the Agents to be sufficiently rested to perform their duties for their shifts the following day.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agents are on standby duty during their off-duty hours is contrary to the regulatory standards. Under &#x00A7; 551.431, an employee's activities may not be found to be substantially limited merely because of restrictions necessary to ensure that he or she will be able to perform his or her duties and responsibilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2). Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agents could do many of the things that they would do at home during their off-duty hours, but determined the Agents' activities are substantially limited because they are expected to spend their off-duty time relaxing so that they would be rested in case of an emergency and be ready to work their shifts the next day. However, this is just the type of restriction that the regulations provide do <span class="Italic">not </span>permit a finding that an employee is on standby duty and thus entitled to standby pay. As OPM explained in promulgating &#x00A7; 551.431 "if an employee is relieved from duty and free to pursue personal activities (though, for practical reasons, limited in where he or she may go), the employee is not in a duty status and the hours are not compensable...[t]he fact that some restrictions may be placed on an employee's personal activities does not mean that the employee must be placed in duty status." 64 Fed. Reg. 69167. Thus, the Arbitrator's reasoning that the Agents' activities are substantially limited is in error.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agents are in a state of readiness to perform work is inconsistent with Authority precedent interpreting &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2). The Arbitrator determined that the Agents are in a state of readiness because they are "required, by virtue of the limitations on what they can do [at the camps], to be alert and sufficiently rested that they can safely be of assistance to their fellow Agents in an emergency. However, the Authority has specifically held that restrictions on employees' activities due to their work locations do not establish a readiness to perform work. "If the restriction to an employee's post of duty were the sole determinant of entitlement to standby pay, the additional requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431(a)(2), that employees remain in a state of readiness to perform work and that their activities be substantially limited, would be rendered meaningless." <span class="Italic">Forest Service, </span>45 FLRA at 1211, 1209 (rejecting union's argument that restriction to closed fire camp was sufficient to place employees in a state of readiness); <span class="Italic">see also Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek, Va., </span>15 FLRA 445, 447 (1984) (grievant's confinement to uninhabited island for three days without ability to leave did not require that he hold himself in a state of readiness to perform additional work); <span class="Italic">cf. NOAA, </span>55 FLRA at 817 (upholding award of standby pay where there was a high degree of frequency with which employees were required to work beyond their regular duty hours and their response had to be immediate as no one else could take the grievants' place). Here, the Agents are encouraged to relax during their off-duty times and are rarely requested to work beyond their regular duty hours. As such, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agents are required to remain in a state of readiness to perform work because of the requirements imposed by their isolation is inconsistent with the above precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator's conclusions that the Agents' activities are substantially limited and that they are expected to remain in a state of readiness to perform work are inconsistent with OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.431 and Authority precedent, we find that the Arbitrator erred in concluding that the Agents non-duty time should be considered standby time under &#x00A7; 551.431. While the Arbitrator erred in this analysis, her award that the Agents were not entitled to standby pay for non-duty time is, nonetheless, correct. As such, we deny the Union's exceptions.</p>
