<p class="Body-Text">"The VRA authority provides for appointment of qualified, covered veterans for positions up to and including the GS-11 level or its equivalent. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(A)." <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Army</span>, 494 Fed. Appx. 63, 64 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP). 38 USC 4214 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1) The United States has an obligation to assist veterans of the Armed Forces in readjusting to civilian life. The Federal Government is also continuously concerned with building an effective work force, and veterans constitute a uniquely qualified recruiting source. It is, therefore, the policy of the United States and the purpose of this section to promote the maximum of employment and job advancement opportunities within the Federal Government for qualified covered veterans (as defined in paragraph (2)(B)) who are qualified for such employment and advancement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;In this section:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;The term "agency" has the meaning given the term "department or agency" in section 4211(5) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;The term "qualified covered veteran" means a veteran described in section 4212(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1) To further the policy stated in subsection (a) of this section, veterans referred to in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be eligible, in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe, for veterans recruitment appointments, and for subsequent career-conditional appointments, under the terms and conditions specified in Executive Order Numbered 11521 (March 26, 1970), except that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;such an appointment may be made up to and including the level GS-11 or its equivalent;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a veteran shall be eligible for such an appointment without regard to the number of years of education completed by such veteran;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;a veteran who is entitled to disability compensation under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or whose <span id="Page_212"></span>discharge or release from active duty was for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty shall be given a preference for such an appointment over other veterans;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;a veteran receiving such an appointment shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;in the case of a veteran with less than 15 years of education, receive training or education; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;upon successful completion of the prescribed probationary period, acquire a competitive status; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;a veteran given an appointment under the authority of this subsection whose employment under the appointment is terminated within one year after the date of such appointment shall have the same right to appeal that termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;This subsection applies to qualified covered veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;A qualified covered veteran may receive such an appointment at any time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Each agency shall include in its affirmative action plan for the hiring, placement, and advancement of handicapped individuals in such agency as required by section 501(b) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791 (b)), a separate specification of plans (in accordance with regulations which the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe in consultation with the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, consistent with the purposes, provisions, and priorities of such Act) to promote and carry out such affirmative action with respect to disabled veterans in order to achieve the purpose of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Notwithstanding section 4211 of this title, the terms "veteran" and "disabled veteran" as used in subsection (a) of this section shall have the meaning provided for under generally applicable civil service law and regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;To further the policy stated in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may give preference to qualified covered veterans for employment in the Department as veterans' benefits counselors and veterans' claims examiners and in positions to provide the outreach services required under section 6303 of this title, to serve as veterans' representatives at certain educational institutions as provided in section 6305 of this title, or to provide readjustment counseling under section 1712A of this title.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This part implements 38 U.S.C. 4214 and Executive Order 11521, which authorizes agencies to appoint <span class="Italic">qualified covered veterans</span> to positions in the competitive service under Veterans Recruitment Appointments (VRAs) without regard to the competitive examining system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 307.102 <span class="Italic">Definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this part--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Agency</span>, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(5), means any agency of the Federal Government or the District of Columbia, including any Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, and the United States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Covered veterans</span>, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3), means any of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Disabled veterans;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Veterans who, while serving on active duty with the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal (AFSM) was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985 (61 FR 1209); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Recently separated veterans.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Disabled veteran</span>, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211 means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A veteran who is entitled to compensation (or who, but for the receipt of military retired pay, would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Qualified</span>, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3) with respect to employment in a position, means having the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation for an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Recently separated veteran</span>, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(6), means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Substantially continuous service</span> is defined in 5 CFR 315.201(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">War</span> means any armed conflict declared by Congress as such.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 307.103 <span class="Italic">Nature of VRAs</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions otherwise in the competitive service. The veterans' preference procedures of part 302 of this chapter apply when there are preference eligible candidates being considered for a VRA. <span class="Italic">Qualified covered veterans</span> who were separated <span class="Italic">under honorable conditions</span> may be appointed to any position in the competitive service at grade levels up to and including GS-11 or equivalent, provided they meet the qualification standards for the position. To be eligible for a VRA as a <span class="Italic">covered veteran</span> under paragraph (2) or (3) of the definition of that term in &#x00A7; 307.102, the veteran must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expeditionary medal, or AFSM. For purposes of a VRA, any military service is qualifying at the GS-3 level or equivalent. Upon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, the incumbent's VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment. An individual may receive more than one VRA appointment as long as the individual meets the definition of a <span class="Italic">covered veteran</span> at the time of appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 307.104 <span class="Italic">Treatment of individuals serving under VRAs</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Because VRAs are made to positions otherwise in the competitive service, the incumbents, like competitive service employees, may be reassigned, promoted, demoted, or transferred in accordance with the provisions of part 335 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A veteran with less than 15 years of education must receive training or education prescribed by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Appointments are subject to investigation by OPM. A law, Executive order, or regulation that disqualifies a person for appointment in the competitive service also disqualifies a person for a VRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The Veterans Recruitment Appointment date for a <span class="Italic">recently separated veteran</span> must occur before the end of the 3-year eligibility period and may not be extended.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">A VRA program appointment is an excepted appointment of a veteran who served during the Vietnam era and the post-Vietnam era to a position that would otherwise be a competitive appointment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Standard Form 50 (SF-50) concerning the appellant's appointment indicates that he received a career-conditional appointment to a competitive-service position pursuant to the Veterans Employment <span id="Page_213"></span>Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), <span class="Italic">as amended by</span> section 511 of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, Pub. L. No. 106-117, 113 Stat. 1545 (1999). The relevant portion of VEOA requires agencies to allow preference eligibles or eligible veterans to compete for vacant positions when the agency will accept applications from individuals from outside its own workforce. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1). Prior to the 1999 amendment, appointees under this authority were given Schedule B appointments in the excepted service; however, since the 1999 amendment, such appointees receive career or career-conditional appointments to the competitive-service position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(2); <span class="Italic">Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-23 (2006). In contrast to the appointment SF-50, the agency's November 7, 2014 letter notifying the appellant of his appointment describes the type and length of his appointment in terms that would apply to a Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA), which is distinct from a VEOA appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. part 307. For purposes of this appeal, whether the appellant received a VRA or VEOA appointment is immaterial because, as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.105, "any individual serving under a VRA, whose employment under the appointment is terminated within 1 year after the date of such appointment, has the same right to appeal that termination as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment," which includes the right to appeal what is at issue here, set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-543, provided employees who receive Veterans Readjustment Appointments in the excepted service, that is, prior to conversion to the competitive service, with an appeal to the Board from a termination if it is alleged that the termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status discrimination, or was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of 5 CFR 315.805 (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Henninger v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because VRA appointments are in the excepted service, 5 C.F.R. part 315 does not apply directly to the appellant, as the initial decision seems to suggest. <span class="Italic">See McCrary</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 6.

Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b), a probationary employee may appeal a termination taken for reasons arising after appointment if he alleges that the termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. <span class="Italic">Rivera v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 1984, Pub.

Section 315.805 provides certain procedural protections if the termination of a probationary employee is for conditions arising before appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.805.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Funari v. VA</span>, DA-315H-12-0319-I-1 (NP 11/27/2013), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Like a competitive service probationary employee, a VRA appointee terminated within 1 year after appointment may only appeal his termination to the Board when the appointee alleges that his termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status, or his termination for pre-appointment conditions was procedurally deficient. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(E); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.105, 315.806. Because the appellant does not allege that his termination within 1 year of his instant appointment was for the aforementioned reasons, the Board would not have jurisdiction over his termination appeal even if the agency appointed him using its VRA authority. Therefore, the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the Board has jurisdiction over his probationary termination appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To secure the rights of a VRA appointee, the appointment must be under the VRA, <span class="Italic">Hudson v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-17-0106-I-1 (NP 1/30/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that she was appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1), which authorizes VRAs. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 16 (2014) (discussing the history and purpose of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 818 F.3d 1361 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clotfelter v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-0752-10-0730-I-1 (NP 2/16/2011), described the limitations on the VRA appointee's ability to appeal a termination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge's finding that the appellant is a non-preference eligible, and thus must meet the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C) in order to have Board appeal rights. The appellant does not meet the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because he was serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service and was terminated during his probationary period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4214(b)(1)(D); <span class="Italic">Jolivette v. Department of Navy</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (a non-preference eligible appointed under the Veterans' Recruitment Appointment authority is subject to a 2-year probationary period); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.101, 307.103. Furthermore, the appellant fails to meet the criteria under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because the record shows that he had only completed approximately 8 months of federal civilian service at the time of his termination, and thus did not have 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806 because the appellant's submissions failed to make any nonfrivolous allegations that his termination was based on political reasons, marital status, or improper procedure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The VRA appointee's right of appeal on termination during the first year of the appointment on procedural grounds extends only to individuals terminated because of preappointment reasons. <span class="Italic">Ballard v.

Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP No. 03-3016) (Board lacked jurisdiction over a terminated VRA appointee's assertions that his removal violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and breached a collective bargaining agreement). An appellant's appeal rights as a VRA probationary employee who has been terminated during his probationary period are the same as those for probationary employees in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Polite v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 653, 656 (1991). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-095.html#sec1-94">Appeal of Probationary Termination</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following the first year of service, a preference eligible VRA employee has Board appeal rights. The VRA employee who achieves competitive status through conversion to a career or career-conditional appointment has statutory appeal rights identical to other employees with that status. If there is no conversion, however, the employee will not likely be able to secure MSPB jurisdiction through a claim that he should have been converted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. MSPB</span>, 12 F.3d 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1993). If a VRA appointee converts to the competitive service, he acquires normal appeal rights, assuming completion of a probationary period, if required. <span class="Italic">Jakes v. VA</span>, 793 F.2d 293 (Fed. Cir. 1986), reversed the Board's conclusion that removal was justified of a VRA appointee who had more education than was then permitted for an appointee under that program. The court apparently considered that the agency should have referred the case to OPM for its determination of whether to take action against the employee for fraud or some other misconduct on his part concerning the appointment process (none was shown); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 109 (3d Cir. 1983) (the court characterized the separation as an adverse action, rather than as the nullification of a void appointment through "correction of administrative oversight"; the employee was on the rolls for two years). [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-003.html#sec6-4">Appointment</a>," concerning procedures used to cure void and voidable appointments.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if an agency reduces the "probationary" period for a VRA appointee, the MSPB's one-year jurisdictional adverse action appeal limit applies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Toomey v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 10, 13-14 (1996). Because, under law predating the 1984 Veterans Benefits Improvement Act, no law or regulation created a right of appeal to the Board by an employee appointed under the Veterans Readjustment Program before completion of one full year of service, the agency could not enlarge the Board's statutory jurisdiction through an erroneous notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Altheimer v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1159). [For additional cases discussing appeal rights of VRA employees, refer to this chapter: "<a href="0100-2023-08-064.html#sec1-65">Preference Eligible Status</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-155.html#sec1-154">One Year of Qualifying Service; Current Continuous Service in The Same or Similar Position</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-052.html#sec1-53">Break in Service</a>"; "<a href="0100-2023-08-086.html#sec1-85">Tacking of Prior Service: Competitive Service Probation</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, agencies, and appellants have the same problems in VRA cases as they do in any others in calculating service that counts toward the accrual <span id="Page_214"></span>of sufficient service to establish appeal rights.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gettings v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 502, 506-09 (1991), explained subtleties of VRA appointments and addressed tacking of prior service in VRA and temporary appointments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A Veterans Readjustment Appointment is an excepted appointment, made after April 8, 1970, to a position otherwise in the competitive service, of a veteran who served during the Vietnam era. 5 CFR 307.101(c). As a preference eligible in the excepted service, a VRA appointee is required to complete one year of "current continuous service in the same or similar positions" under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) before he is entitled to the adverse action rights of 5 USC 7513.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martinez-Claudio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the appellant did not complete one year of current, continuous service in the same or similar positions, the administrative judge first compared the similarity of the appellant's duties as a GS-5 Grounds Maintenance Contract Monitor with his duties as a GS-7 Construction Inspector. This was error. In making a determination whether an individual has the requisite service under section 7511(a)(1)(B), it is the one-year period immediately prior to separation that counts, not some earlier period. <span class="Italic">Carr v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 19 MSPR 143, 145 (1984); <span class="Italic">Short v. VA</span>, 8 MSPR 70, 72 (1981). The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant's temporary appointment to the GS-7 position at Beale AFB could not be combined with his appointment to the GS-9 position at McClellan AFB because these positions were held under separate VRA appointments. We disagree. The statute, and our decisions in <span class="Italic">Geter</span> and <span class="Italic">Short</span>, focus on whether the positions in question are the "same or similar" in nature, not on the legal authority under which the appointments were made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our conclusion that two or more VRA appointments can be combined to meet the one-year requirement is reinforced by reference to the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), which indicates that service under the VRA Program is intended to be limited to a single two-year term, even if it entails more than one appointment and/or a promotion. The FPM gives the following guidance regarding the effect of a promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The promotion, reassignment, or transfer of an employee serving under a veterans readjustment appointment does not relieve the employee or the agency of their obligations with respect to satisfactory participation and completion of the developmental plan. If necessary, the plan may be changed to meet the employee's needs in the new position.... The modified plan, however, must be one that can be completed prior to the scheduled conversion date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Ch. 307, Subch. 1-5(6) (May 3, 1985). The provision describing eligibility for conversion to career status states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee serving under a veterans readjustment appointment shall have his/her appointment converted to career or career-conditional appointment within 30 calendar days after he/she meets the following conditions: (a) He/she has completed without break in service of more than 30 calendar days, two years of substantially continuous service under a veterans readjustment appointment or appointments....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPM Ch. 315, Subch. 7-7(a) (July 21, 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant was a preference eligible in the excepted service who had completed one year of current continuous service. His entitlement to the adverse action procedural and appeal rights of 5 USC 7513 thus depends on whether the positions he held as a GS-7 Construction Inspector and as a GS-9 Service Contract Monitor were the "same or similar."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions are "similar" within the meaning of section 7511(a)(1)(B) when they "involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988). According to the official job description for the GS-7 position at Beale AFB, its purpose is "to provide inspection and surveillance over alteration and new construction performed by civilian contractors and monitor service contracts." The listed purpose of the GS-9 position at McClellan AFB is "to provide technical assistance as a Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE) performing inspection duties related to the surveillance of a variety of service type contracts in accordance with AFR 400-28 and other types of surveillance plans." Both positions thus involve the oversight of the performance of civilian contractors. The job description for the GS-9 position, however, includes a number of duties and responsibilities not included in the GS-7 job description: Writing statements of work specifications; preparing cost estimates and work orders; establishing delivery dates and the minimum standards to be met by service contractors; developing the Quality Assurance Evaluation surveillance plans for service contracts; approving or disapproving the workmanship of craftsmen performing the contracts; and certifying final payment to the contractor when the contract is complete.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Were we to base our determination solely on the official job descriptions, we would have no trouble concluding that the position of GS-7 Construction Inspector is not similar to the position of GS-9 Service Contract Monitor. The appellant testified, however, that he did not perform the duties described in the job descriptions for either the GS-7 or GS-9 positions. He stated that his actual job duties remained the same throughout his employment with the Air Force, namely, monitoring the performance of a particular grounds contractor. This testimony was unrebutted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board faced a similar divergence between job descriptions and actual job performance in <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPB 630, 7 MSPR 18 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 9 MSPB 28, 9 MSPR 380 (1982). In that case, "knowledge of a scheme" was an integral part of the duties of a distribution clerk, but not of the duties of a mail handler, according to the official job descriptions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 7 MSPR at 19. The Board found "the salient feature of this case [to be] that there is no evidence in the record that appellant ever performed duties requiring knowledge of a scheme." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In resolving the conflict between the position descriptions and the testimony regarding Van Skiver's actual job duties, the Board quoted with approval the following statement from a Court of Claims decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">What is important is not what the former Chairman intended, but what the nature of the work plaintiff actually performed [as a Confidential Assistant] was as compared with the work plaintiff was required to perform as a Personnel Assistant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21 (quoting <span class="Italic">Dargo v. United States</span>, 176 Ct. Cl. 1193, 1202 (1966)). The Board concluded that, "since it is clear that appellant's duties did not significantly change despite his different job assignments, the positions were in the same line of work." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We similarly conclude that, since the actual job duties performed by the appellant were the same under the GS-7 and GS-9 appointments, these positions were the "same or similar" within the meaning of 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The limitations on appeal rights of VRA employees are for those with less than a year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. Service for more than a year through combined dissimilar positions does not meet the requirements for a ordinary appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Perez v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-1155); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Martinez-Claudio v.

Under the former FPM Ch. 307, subch. 1-8(b) (May 3, 1985), and other law predating case refining the concept of current continuous service, temporary and term employment did not count toward the two-year service requirement included under the VRA authority for conversion to career or career-conditional appointment. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3202). Under <span class="Italic">Polite v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 653, 657 (1991), if the agency mistakenly calculates the first year of a VRA appointment for an individual who is a preference eligible, and has appeal rights under the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, the Board applies its harmful error rule to determine if the employee was given minimal <span id="Page_215"></span>due process: prior notice of the charges, an explanation of the supporting evidence, and an opportunity to respond. Without minimal due process, the removal will be reversed. If these rights were provided, the removal will not be reversed for procedural error, i.e., the failure to adhere to statutory or regulatory provisions governing adverse actions against tenured employees.

<p class="Body-Text">A nonpreference VRA appointee with an intermittent schedule had appeal rights based on more than two years of service in the same or similar positions, <span class="Italic">Jolivette v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 100 MSPR 216, 219-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An "employee," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), has appeal rights to the Board from certain agency actions such as a removal for cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(a), 7513(d). The record shows that the agency appointed the appellant to his Firefighter position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.103 upon selection from a VRA list. The record also indicates that the appellant is a nonpreference eligible, that his appointments and positions were in the excepted service, and that his work schedule was intermittent. A VRA appointment is an excepted-service appointment to a position otherwise in the competitive service, and VRA appointees are converted to the competitive service after satisfactorily completing two years of substantially continuous service under the VRA program. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.102(b), 307.104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant was a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service, the applicable statutory provision is section 7511(a)(1)(C), which covers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was serving "under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service," so the remaining question under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) is whether he was "serving a probationary or trial period" under such an appointment. <span class="Italic">See Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Pennington v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 8, 10 n.2 (1993). It appears that, contrary to the AJ's finding that the appellant completed his one-year probationary period, the appellant, as a nonpreference eligible VRA appointee, was subject to a two-year probationary period. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 307.102(b), 307.104. However, we need not determine the length of the appellant's probationary period or whether he completed it[2] because we find that he satisfied the alternative jurisdictional criteria under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1148-51 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (subsections (C)(i) and (C)(ii) of section 7511(a)(1) are alternative<span class="Italic"></span> criteria, so that an individual need not satisfy both criteria to be an "employee" with Board appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;"For intermittent employees [in the competitive service] ..., each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion of [the 1-year] probation" in the competitive service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(d). Consistent with section 315.802(d), the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Moran v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 532, 536 (1998), that "[a]n intermittent employee who has been in a pay status for 260 days is considered to have completed his probationary period and is, therefore, an 'employee' with appeal rights to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i)." <span class="Italic">Accord Rison v. Department of Defense</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 390, 392 n.1 (1997);<span class="Italic"> Gibson v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 335, 337 (1988). The AJ here relied on <span class="Italic">Moran</span> to hold that the appellant was an "employee" with appeal rights because he was in a pay status for more than 260 days. ID at 2-3. However, section 315.802(d) and <span class="Italic">Moran</span> pertain solely to<span class="Italic"></span> the definitional criteria under section 7511(a)(1)(A) for individuals in the competitive service, for which a 1-year probationary period applies; they do not necessarily apply to individuals in the excepted service, like the appellant, whose probationary period is not necessarily limited to 1 year. We therefore find that the AJ's reliance on <span class="Italic">Moran</span> is insufficient to establish that the appellant is an "employee" with Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's intermittent VRA appointment was "other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less,"[3] so the remaining question under section 7511(1)(a)(C)(ii) is whether he "completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency." It is undisputed that the appellant served as a Firefighter with an "intermittent" work schedule from July 29, 1997, to May 7, 2004. "<span class="Italic">Intermittent employment</span> means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 340.401(b) (original emphasis), and it is undisputed that the appellant was on nonduty, nonpay status for a substantial portion of his nearly seven years of employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We do not decide whether a non-intermittent VRA appointment is "other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 141 (2005), and <span class="Italic">Pollak v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 187 (2005), the Board addressed a similar issue of how periods of nonduty, nonpay status for <span class="Italic">seasonal</span> employment should be counted in determining whether the "current continuous service" requirement under section 7511(a)(1)(A)(i) is satisfied. The Board noted that "current continuous service" is defined, in pertinent part, as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action...without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b); <span class="Italic">Pollak,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. at 190; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. at 145. The Board held that periods of nonpay status consistent with the terms of seasonal employment counts fully toward satisfying the "current continuous service" requirement, even though they do not count fully toward satisfying the "probationary or trial period" requirement[4], since nonpay status while remaining on the rolls does not constitute a "break in service." <span class="Italic">Pollak,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. at 189-90; <span class="Italic">Gutierrez,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. at 145-47. Although <span class="Italic">Gutierrez</span> and <span class="Italic">Pollak</span> involved subsection (A), rather than subsection (C) as here, the holding in those cases interpreting "probationary or trial period" and "current continuous service" in subsection (A)(i)-(ii) applies equally to interpreting the identical statutory terms in subsection (C)(i)-(ii). <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding that the interpretation of the statutory term "or" in section 7511(a)(1)(C), set forth in a prior decision, was equally applicable to interpreting the same statutory term "or" in section 7511(a)(1)(A)). We therefore find that "current continuous service" under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) includes periods of nonpay status consistent with the terms of intermittent (or seasonal) employment.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;"Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays," and "[n]onpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount" in the competitive service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c).</p>

For the reasons discussed in the text above, we overrule <span class="Italic">Gibson</span> and <span class="Italic">Holt</span> to the extent that they are inconsistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is, however, a significant difference between subsection (C)(ii) and (A)(ii), of section 7511(a)(1). To wit, subsection (C)(ii), unlike subsection (A)(ii), includes the additional requirement that the "current continuous service" be "in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency." All of the appellant's service at issue here, from July 29, 1997, to May 7, 2004, was in the Department of the Navy of the Department of Defense, an Executive agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 102, 105. Positions are similar within the meaning of section 7511(a)(1) when they are in "the same line of work," which has been interpreted as involving related or comparable work that requires the same or similar knowledge, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (1988); <span class="Italic">Burrell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 204, 209 (1997). Although the record shows that the appellant was promoted on July 27, 2003, from a GS-4 Firefighter position to a GS-5 Firefighter position, the two positions are clearly in the same line of work, and the agency has not argued otherwise. We therefore find that the appellant is an "employee" under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) with a right to appeal his termination (or removal) to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, upon finding jurisdiction over this appeal, proceeded to find that the appellant's termination must be reversed because the agency denied the appellant his constitutional right to minimum due process by terminating him without affording him an opportunity to respond. The agency has not disputed this finding on review, and we discern no reason to disturb it.[7] In addition, the appellant has not challenged the AJ's rejection of his claims of whistleblower reprisal and prohibited discrimination. We note that the AJ erred by rejecting the appellant's whistleblower reprisal claim on jurisdictional grounds, when the Board has jurisdiction over the claim in connection with the otherwise appealable removal action. This adjudicatory error by the AJ was not prejudicial to the appellant's substantive rights, however, because the appellant failed to raise any specific allegations in support of her whistleblower reprisal claim and thus failed to establish it. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. <span id="Page_216"></span>Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The agency is permitted to bring another action against the appellant based on the same reasons underlying the removal that is the subject of this appeal because the Board is reversing the removal on procedural grounds without reaching the merits. <span class="Italic">See Strope v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kane v. Dept. of Army</span>, 60 MSPR 605, 608-11 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of his VRA appointment, the appellant was required to serve a two-year probationary period after which he would be placed non-competitively into the competitive service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 38 USC 4214(b)(1)(D)(ii). Although it is undisputed that the appellant would have completed this period on December 16, 1992, if he had not been indefinitely suspended from October 20, 1992, until the date of his removal, we find that his placement in a non-duty, non-pay status prevented him from completing this probationary period. <span class="Italic">David v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 13 MSPB 126, 14 MSPR 467, 469 (1983) (probationary period was properly extended by employee's time on nonpaid leave which exceeded 22 working days). <span class="Italic">Cf. Tom v. Department of the Interior</span>, 32 MSPR 126, 128-30 (1987) (finding appellant met current continuous service requirement where his placement on non-duty, non-pay status was not due to adverse suspension action).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In the appellant's "Objection to Agency Motion to Dismiss" his appeal for lack of jurisdiction, he stated that he was serving in his "fourth temporary appointment" immediately prior to receiving his VRA appointment on December 16, 1990. As a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service, however, the appellant's prior temporary employment does not count under the two year service requirement of the VRA<span class="Italic">. See</span> FPM Ch. 307, subch. 1-8(b). <span class="Italic">Cf. Hales v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 503, 507 (1992) (preference eligible employees in the excepted service may count their service in a temporary position toward completion of the 1 year of current continuous service requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)); <span class="Italic">Compton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 31 MSPR 402, 403 (1986) (while service in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of one year under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), service under a temporary limited appointment may not be counted in determining whether an employee in the competitive service has completed one year of current continuous service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, we note that the administrative judge, in effect, rejected the agency's reliance on FPM Ch. 315, subch. 7-7c, 8-4c, finding the twenty-two work day rule to be inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Ch. 315, Appendix A-3(2) (September 19, 1989). These provisions apply, respectively, to the computation of "substantially continuous" service to qualify a veterans readjustment appointee for conversion to a competitive service position and to the computation of service to complete the probationary period in the competitive service. While neither application specifically determines the end of the trial period of an excepted service appointment made pending conversion to the competitive service, we find that the purposes of the rule are sufficiently similar that the same rule should apply for this related purpose. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.803; <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 686, 690 (1992) (since demotion from supervisory position to lower-graded position and termination of probationer in competitive service were analogous, FPM guidance for probationary terminations was applied to demotion). We also find that, if the appellant had completed the two year trial period, he would have been converted to the competitive service, and thus he would have been an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the appellant does not have appeal rights under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). This provision affords appeal rights to a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service who has completed two years of current continuous service in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to two years or less. Based on our review of the legislative history of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, we find that Congress intended sections 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) and 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) to be mutually exclusive. In this connection, the legislative history refers to 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) as "[t]he probationary exclusion," stating that the exclusion is intended to address specific job situations such as VRA appointments. <span class="Italic">See</span> 136 Cong. Rec. S11,135 (daily ed. July 30, 1990) (statement of Sen. Pryor). The legislative history indicates that Congress intended that those individuals serving trial periods of employment under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) were not to be afforded appeal rights under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pennington v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 MSPR 8, 10-11 (1993) (5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) applied to nonpreference eligible in the excepted service serving under a permanent appointment; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) did not apply to him since he was not serving under a probationary or trial period pending conversion to the competitive service). Consequently, 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) does not provide the appellant with appeal rights because he was serving in a trial period of employment pending conversion to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does have the same limited appeal rights as probationers in the competitive service who make a non-frivolous allegation that their terminations resulted from discrimination based on marital status or partisan political reasons. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Polite v. Department of the Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 653, 656 (1991). Because the administrative judge found that the appellant was an employee with full appeal rights to the Board, she never properly informed him of what he needed to show to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue.... Accordingly, we find that remand is appropriate.</p>
