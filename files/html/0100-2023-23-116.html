<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-114"><span class="space">3.</span> Consequential Damages and Costs--Whistleblower Case</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Consequential damages were made available under the 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act (discussed in Chapter 13 under "<a href="0100-2023-20-004.html#sec13-5">Whistleblowing Reprisal</a>"), providing relief to employees and applicants who can demonstrate that job actions were improperly tainted by reprisal against whistleblowing activities. The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act added compensatory damages to the mix of remedies in a whistleblower reprisal case. Consequential damages (or compensatory damages under the WPEA) are available when the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under 5 USC 1221 and when the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 USC 1214. <span class="Italic">Seibel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 87 MSPR 260, 266 n.3 (2000). The 1994 legislation did not define consequential damages. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-117.html#sec16-115">Compensatory Damages --Whistleblower Case</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1214(a)(3), as amended in 2012, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except in a case in which an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board under any law, rule, or regulation, any such employee, former employee, or applicant shall seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before seeking corrective action from the Board. An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board under section 1221, if such employee, former employee, or applicant seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9) (A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) from the Special Counsel....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1214(g), as amended in 2012, adds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1221, as amended in 2012, provides, in part, as to IRA appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)(1)(A)&#x2003;If the Board orders corrective action<span class="Italic"> under this section,</span> such corrective action may include--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4943"></span>(i)&#x2003;that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages, and compensatory damages (including interest, reasonable expert witness fees, and costs).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 1221(i) provides (as amended by the WPEA, but not materially different than the pre-2012 version):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsections (a) through (h) shall apply in any proceeding brought under section 7513(d) if, or to the extent that, a prohibited personnel practice as defined in section 2302 (b)(8) or section 2302 (b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) is alleged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although consequential damages were available for IRA appeals (first presented through OSC) and for OSC corrective actions, but in cases raising whistleblowing reprisal on direct appeal to the Board from an otherwise appealable action, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Bohac v. USDA,</span> 239 F.3d 1334, 1338-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>, (an adverse action appeal that discussed consequential damages), the Federal Circuit determined, not without ambiguity, in <span class="Italic">Prichard v. DOD</span>, 484 Fed. Appx. 489, 490-91 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), as to a Chapter 43 performance appeal not involving a whistleblower reprisal claim but asserting a claim for consequential damages nonetheless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's authority to award consequential and compensatory damages is limited. <span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) ("To sustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims."). While the Board has the power to award consequential damages when ordering corrective action pursuant to a Special Counsel complaint proceeding under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b)(2), this power does not avail Prichard for two reasons. First, Prichard seeks damages to remedy his non-pecuniary losses. But the consequential damages provision of &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2) does not authorize damages for non-pecuniary losses. <span class="Italic">See Bohac v. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (explaining, in reaching the same conclusion regarding the corresponding provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221, that "section 1214...was designed to allow only for reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs" and not non-pecuniary damages). Second, nothing waives sovereign immunity to grant the Board authority to award &#x00A7; 1214 damages in a direct appeal as opposed to a Special Counsel investigation. <span class="Italic">See Giove v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 53, 57 (2007) ("The Board's authority to award damages is limited to a few categories of cases, i.e., cases in which the Board orders corrective action in an individual right of action appeal, those in which it orders corrective action in response to a petition filed by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214, and those in which it finds intentional discrimination of a kind covered under the Civil Rights act of 1991."); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.201(c) ("An award of consequential damages is authorized in only two situations: Where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal...and where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint."). The Board was, thus, correct in concluding that Prichard's claim for consideration of his alleged harmful procedural error and prohibited personnel practices evidence was moot because the Board, in granting reinstatement, back pay, and benefits, had granted all the relief he may obtain.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court's discussion in <span class="Italic">Prichard</span> may have been somewhat attenuated, since the quoted section was not really necessary for the result reached by the court and may not have been the true focus of the opinion writer. <span class="Italic">Prichard</span> was a Chapter 43 case, not covered by 5 USC 1221(i), concerning adverse actions appealed under 5 USC 7513(d). Statutory analysis suggests that consequential damages (and now compensatory damages) should be available when a whistleblower claim is successfully pursued as an affirmative defense in an adverse action. The limitations expressed in <span class="Italic">Prichard</span> on the scope of consequential damages may have been overcome by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board did not cite <span class="Italic">Prichard</span>, but noted the availability of consequential damages only in OSC corrective actions or IRA cases in <span class="Italic">Voeller v. Dept. of Army</span>, AT-0752-12-0447-C-1 (NP 9/30/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to consequential damages, the Board may make such an award only in two circumstances: (1) as authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 applies; or, (2) as authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2), where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.202(b)(1)-(2). Although the appellant indicated that she would also like to file a whistleblower claim with her suspension appeal, and she requested an award of consequential damages in connection with it, the administrative judge did not adjudicate the appellant's affirmative defenses. Thus, the essential predicate that might allow for such an award has not occurred, and, in the absence of any express statutory authorization to award such damages, the Board lacks authority to do so. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 156, 159 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Voeller</span> may not provide complete analysis of the statutory underpinnings for consequential damages, for the circumstances of the case were such that the AJ had not adjudicated the appellant's affirmative defense of whistleblowing.

VA</span>, 58 MSPR 318, 323-24 (1993) ("The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1222 states that '[e]xcept as provided in section 1221(i), nothing in...chapter [12] or chapter 23 shall be construed to limit any right or remedy available under a provision of statute that is outside of [either chapter] .' Thus, section 1222 strongly suggests that any rights under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, such as the right to raise affirmative defenses in matters appealable under those chapters, are not restricted."). <span class="Italic">Bohac v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB determined that Mr. Hickey "did not prove that he incurred actual monetary losses or out of pocket costs" and is, therefore, "not entitled to consequential damages." Mr. Hickey asserts that he is entitled to consequential damages because it "is undisputed that for nineteen months [DHS] forced Mr. Hickey to remain in travel status for more than twelve hours per day." We agree with the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the MSPB's decision that Mr. Hickey is not entitled to consequential damages. To recover consequential damages, Mr. Hickey was required to provide evidence of his out-of-pocket expenses or monetary losses that resulted from his sixty-three-mile commute. <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1343 (explaining that consequential damages are limited to "reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs" and limiting consequential damages under the WPA to out-of-pocket expenses").

<p class="Block-Quote1">...sought the following: (1) a geographical transfer away from the work site and the supervisors who were found to have retaliated against him, and a promotion; (2) "trial preparation costs" consisting of reimbursement of 164 hours of annual leave he took to prepare and present, and review the ID in his IRA appeal; $135 for photocopying, long distance calls, and postage; and $1000 in mileage costs he incurred making numerous <span id="Page_4944"></span>trips to a law library to work on his appeal; (3) "medical treatment costs" consisting of reimbursement of 161 hours of sick leave he took because of ailments he suffered as a result of the tension and strained conditions at work; $800 for costs incurred by his wife in connection with her treatment for depression, and by both of them for marital counseling they underwent; $438.75 in travel costs incurred by the appellant and his wife for her treatment and their counseling; and $2,650 in attorney fees he incurred when he and his wife divorced. The appellant also requested attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the instant motion and hearing on consequential damages. In response, the agency challenged the appellant's entitlement to all but the $135 for photocopying, long distance calls, and postage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thereafter, the AJ issued an ID in which he made the following findings: (1) The issue of the appellant's entitlement to a transfer and promotion was beyond the scope of the appeal (although it could be the subject of a new IRA appeal, if he first exhausted his remedy with the Office of Special Counsel); (2) he was entitled to be reimbursed for a reasonable amount of annual leave, determined to be 76 hours of the 164 hours requested; $1000 in mileage; and $135 for photocopying, long distance calls, and postage; and (3) because they were unsupported and/or too attenuated, he was not entitled to reimbursement for the sick leave he took; medical costs incurred by his wife, counseling costs incurred by him and his wife, or travel expenses in connection therewith; or legal costs for his divorce. The AJ stated that the appellant's motion for attorney fees was more properly handled in a separate proceeding, and advised him to file such a motion with supporting documentation within 60 days. In sum, the AJ granted the appellant's motion for damages in part ($1,135 and reimbursement for, or reinstatement of, 76 hours of annual leave), and denied the motion in part (in regard to all other claims).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With one exception, we find no error in the AJ's well-reasoned findings regarding the appellant's entitlement to some, but not all, of the damages he seeks based on his successful IRA appeal. Accordingly, but for that exception, we do not disturb the AJ's findings. The exception is the AJ's order to restore to the appellant 76 hours of annual leave he spent pursuing his appeal. Until now, the Board has not considered whether "consequential damages," as provided for in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) of the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), includes reimbursing a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant for annual leave expended in pursuing an IRA appeal. Upon review, and as set forth below, we find that the AJ's order to grant such relief was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To reach this conclusion, we begin by examining an earlier version of the WPA than that currently in effect. Under the WPA of 1989, a prevailing employee, in addition to the corrective action, could recover only "reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)-(2) (1988). In <span class="Italic">Wiatr v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 441, 446-53 (1991), the Board refused to grant, to the successful appellant in an IRA appeal, an award of out-of-pocket litigation-related expenses as a component of attorney fees, on the basis that, under the statute, only such costs as were incurred by an attorney on the appellant's behalf were recoverable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 452. The Board subsequently overturned that specific holding in <span class="Italic">Bonggat v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 59 M.S.P.R. 175, 178-79 (1993), finding that direct, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the appellant were instead part of the "costs" incidental to attorney representation, even though they were incurred by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Bonggat</span> did not, however, disturb another of the holdings in <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, that the successful appellant was not entitled to restoration of annual leave he used to pursue his IRA appeal. The Board held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">With respect to the appellant's request for restoration of his annual leave, we find that it does not concern the issue of attorney fees and is more appropriately a matter for a petition for enforcement.... To the extent, however, that the appellant is contending that he is entitled to reimbursement for annual leave he used in pursuing his appeal, as we have held here, he is not entitled to such reimbursement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Drake v. Department of Transportation</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 676, 681 &#x0026; n.2 (1988) (there is no legal authority that entitles a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant to compensatory time in lieu of attorney fees for annual leave used in successfully pursuing his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> actions or to paid time not chargeable to annual or sick leave....).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA was amended in 1994, Act of October 29, 1994, Pub.L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 8(b)(2), 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. (108 Stat.) 4361, 4365. The 1994 Amendments provided additional rights and remedies for protected whistleblowers, specifically, "that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and <span class="Italic">any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages."</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that, under this statutory provision, the appellant was entitled to reimbursement for annual leave he used in pursuit of his appeal, subject only to a reasonable standard, the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Forrest v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 213, 224-25 (1997). There, the Board found that an appeal was not moot, despite the agency's rescission of the action, because the appellant's claim for reimbursement of annual leave he used to meet with his attorney constituted a valid claim for compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA). Acknowledging that compensatory damages and consequential damages are "not interchangeable," the AJ in the instant case nonetheless found them similar enough to entitle the appellant to reimbursement for the reasonable amount of annual leave he used in pursuit of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The CRA specifically authorized the Board to exercise broadened remedial power, consistent with the established "make whole" objective of that statute. <span class="Italic">Forrest,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. at 224; <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 196-97 (1996). The authority to award damages in this case, however, is the WPA. The Board, and our reviewing court, have concluded that Congress intended a narrow construction of "consequential damages" in the 1994 amendments to the WPA. <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 338 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-10, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 215 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table); <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Moreover, while there is language in the WPA's legislative history, specifically, the Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3549, 3559, to the effect that the WPA "allows the Board to order corrective action that will make, as nearly as possible, the individual 'whole,"' the court in <span class="Italic">Bohac</span> examined that statement, finding that it was "merely a general statement about the purpose of the statute" that did not contradict the government's view that it should be interpreted narrowly. <span class="Italic">Bohac,</span> 239 F.3d at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that it was error for the AJ to expansively interpret "consequential damages" to include the use of annual leave by the appellant to prosecute his IRA appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. Not every loss or expense is recoverable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bohac,</span> 239 F.3d at 1339-43 (the term "consequential damages" in section 1221(g) is limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and does not include non-pecuniary damages). Where an appellant acts <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, it is commonly understood that he is expending time in lieu of attorney fees, and there is nothing in the WPA to suggest that Congress intended for that common understanding to be overturned. Representation costs are not items of damages. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Taxpayers for the Animas-La Plata Referendum v. Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District,</span> 739 F.2d 1472, 1480 (10th Cir. 1984) (expenses such as legal fees and costs are generally not considered "damages" because they are not the legitimate consequences of the tort or breach of contract sued upon); <span class="Italic">Kania v. United States,</span> 227 Ct. Cl. 458, 650 F.2d 264, 269 (1981) (counsel fees and other litigation expenses are not the kind of consequential damages awarded in contract breach cases). Leave used by an appellant to pursue an appeal before the Board has long been regarded as voluntary and not reimbursable, being merely a claim for an award of money in lieu of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sanders v. Equal</span> Employment <span class="Italic">Opportunity Commission,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 693, 696 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also Drake</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. at 681, n.2; <span class="Italic">Roman v. Department of the Army</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 409, 420 (1996) (under section 1221(g), "the appellant may not recover attorney fees for the work he himself performed in litigating this appeal"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 129 F.3d 134 (Fed.

An appellant's voluntary choice to represent himself, and to take accrued leave to do so, is simply not an out-of-pocket type of expense within the meaning of "consequential damages" as defined by our reviewing court, or under our own precedent. Under the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Bohac</span> and <span class="Italic">Wiatr</span>, the Board lacks the statutory authority to expansively read "consequential damages" under section 1221(g) to permit such an award.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">After the ID was issued, we addressed this issue for the first time and held that consequential damages do not include reimbursing an appellant for annual leave expended in pursuing an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 14. Thus, the appellant is not entitled to restoration of any annual leave. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether LWOP spent pursuing an IRA appeal is recoverable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), is an issue of first impression with the Board. However, the same rationale we used in <span class="Italic">Reams</span> for annual leave applies to LWOP. In finding that consequential damages does not include reimbursing an appellant for annual leave expended in pursuing an IRA appeal, we noted Congress's intention that consequential damages be interpreted narrowly and recent case law limiting consequential <span id="Page_4945"></span>damages to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and excluding non-pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14; <span class="Italic">see Bohac,</span> 239 F.3d at 1339-43. We relied on case law finding that representation costs are not items of damages, <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">e.g., Taxpayers for the Animas-La Plata Referendum v. Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District,</span> 739 F.2d 1472, 1480 (10th Cir. 1984), and Board precedent finding that leave used by an appellant to pursue an appeal before the Board is considered voluntary and not reimbursable, <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">e.g., Sanders v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 693, 696 (1990). These reasons for finding that annual leave taken to pursue an IRA appeal is not compensable apply equally to LWOP taken to pursue an IRA appeal. Therefore, we find that consequential damages do not include LWOP expended in pursuing an IRA appeal. The AJ thus erred in ordering the agency to reimburse the appellant for LWOP taken from January 1, 1997, to February 3, 2000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also erred in finding that the appellant was entitled to consequential damages for the sick leave he allegedly used as a result of the agency's whistleblowing reprisal. "[M]edical costs incurred" are one of the statutory examples of consequential damages. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 609 &#x00B6; 19 (2001). Such costs include "medical expenses which are a result of the retaliation and which can be proven with reasonable certainty." <span class="Italic">Pastor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609 &#x00B6; 19. Below, the appellant requested restoration of 400 hours of sick leave he used since January 1997, and submitted leave and earnings statements, which document the number of hours and the dates sick leave was taken. He claimed that he "has been frequently ill as a result of the stress and effort." He further claimed that this sick leave, as well as the annual leave and LWOP he used during that same period, are a "pittance compared to the cost of time, stress, fatigue, resultant illness [he] ha[s] experienced as a consequence of the agency's cruel, calculated, and repeated, efforts to punish [him] and [his] family during this time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, other than these bare assertions of frequent illness, stress, and fatigue and his leave and earning statements, and despite the AJ's and the agency's notification that he has the burden of proving his claimed damages with specificity and must submit evidence establishing that his claimed damages were reasonable, foreseeable, and causally related to the agency's whistleblowing reprisal, the appellant has not submitted any evidence showing that he incurred leave as a result of the agency's whistleblowing reprisal. He has not alleged nor provided any evidence that he was ever diagnosed with a medical condition during this sick leave period, nor that he ever sought medical treatment for the alleged "stress" or "illness." Nor has he demonstrated a causal connection between the agency's whistleblowing reprisal against him in 1995 and 1997, and the hundreds of hours of sick leave he took from January 1997, through February 3, 2000. Under these circumstances, even assuming that restoration of sick leave is payable as "medical costs incurred" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), the appellant has not shown that he is entitled to such relief.[9] <span class="Italic">See Pastor,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 609 &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In light of this finding, we need not and do not address, here, whether sick leave would ever be compensable as "medical costs incurred," i.e., as consequential damages, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 64 Fed. Appx. 234, 240-41 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board did not err in reversing the AJ's awards of restored annual and sick leave and compensation for leave without pay. In <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334 (Fed. Cir. 2001), we examined the meaning of the term "consequential damages" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii). Rejecting the argument that we should adopt that term's common law meaning, we held that "consequential damages," as used in &#x00A7; 1221 (g), are limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and do not include non-pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339-43. Carson's request for consequential damages for the leave that he took, however, are not out-of-pocket costs. Restored leave or monetary compensation for the leave that Carson voluntarily took from his job to pursue his appeal before the Board would effectively be compensation for Carson's own time, rather than reimbursement of an out-of-pocket expense. In addition, to the extent that he took leave due to stress and fatigue, Carson's request is akin to a request for non-pecuniary damages. That Carson has characterized his request for damages in terms of hours of leave to be restored or compensated does not change the essential nature of the damages he seeks. We thus conclude that leave voluntarily taken from work to pursue an appeal is not a reimbursable out-of-pocket expense and that Carson is therefore not entitled to consequential damages for annual leave, sick leave, and leave without pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the Board that Carson is not entitled to restoration of sick leave under &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii)'s provision for damages for "medical costs incurred." Before both the AJ and the full Board, Carson asserted that he took 400 hours of sick leave due to the stress, fatigue, and illness caused by DOE's unlawful actions. On appeal, Carson argues that the Board should have remanded the issue of sick leave to the AJ with instructions as to what would constitute sufficient evidence. However, both the AJ and the Board notified Carson that he must prove his claimed damages with specificity and must establish that his claimed damages were reasonable, foreseeable, and causally related to DOE's whistleblowing reprisal. Nevertheless, the only evidence that Carson submitted to prove his claim for restored sick leave was his leave and earning statements. In light of those facts, we conclude that the Board gave Carson sufficient instruction on his evidentiary burden and properly concluded that Carson had not proved that he was entitled to compensation for sick leave as a "medical cost incurred."[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Like the Board, we express no opinion as to whether any type of leave may ever be restored as a "medical cost[ ] incurred" under &#x00A7; 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ granted in part the appellant's subsequent motion for consequential damages. The AJ awarded part of the appellant's requested amount for medical expenses totaling $5,341.26 and part of the appellant's requested amount for various other expenses totaling $931.29. The AJ also awarded the appellant's requested amount for interest she paid until September 10, 2003, on loans for money that she had borrowed between 1998 and 2002 ($4,839.02); her requested amount for interest she lost on funds she had to spend from inheritances she received in 2000 ($6,749.43); her requested amount for interest she lost on an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that she opened in 2001 and that she had to withdraw early ($452.62); and her requested amount for the early withdrawal penalty ($250). Those additional amounts totaled $12,291.07.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not award the appellant's requested amounts for her increased tax liability resulting from her receipt of a lump-sum back pay award and a lump-sum Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) annuity benefits award. The AJ also did not award the appellant her requested amounts for interest on the VSIP and interest on her lump-sum payment for annual leave. The AJ awarded a total of $18,563.62 in consequential damages.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Corrective action in an IRA appeal may include "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">see Carson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has concluded that consequential damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g) are limited to out-of-pocket costs and do not include non-pecuniary damages. <span class="Italic">Bohac v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 239 F.3d 1334, 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In reaching that conclusion, the court found that recovery of damages under the statute may not be allowed unless the government has waived sovereign immunity. It noted that such a waiver must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text and strictly construed in favor of the sovereign. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1339. Applying the interpretive rule of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, the court found that Congress intended a narrow construction of "consequential damages" in the 1994 amendment to the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1342. It further found that the general phrase "any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]" should be read to cover only items similar in nature to the specific items listed in the statute, i.e., back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, and travel expenses. It noted that those items are all actual monetary losses or out-of-pocket expenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the AJ erred in denying her consequential damages to compensate her for the interest lost because of the delay in granting her VSIP and for the interest on her lump-sum payment for annual leave. Citing <span class="Italic">Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609 (2001), she emphasizes the WPA's remedial nature. She argues that, <span id="Page_4946"></span>absent the agency's reprisal, she would have retired and received the VSIP and lump-sum payment by no later than May 31, 2002. Because the agency filed a PFR, however, it did not process her retirement until October 2003. She contends that the interest that she seeks is a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of the agency's decision. She claims that she is due $1,838.30 for interest accrued from June 1, 2002, through October 30, 2003, on her VSIP, and $1,710.16 for interest accrued from June 1, 2002, through October 30, 2003, on her lump-sum payment for annual leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that the AJ erred in declining to grant her consequential damages for that interest. First, she has failed to establish that consequential damages includes such interest. She has referred only to the general language of <span class="Italic">Pastor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609, to support her claim. Admittedly, <span class="Italic">Pastor</span> emphasized the remedial and "make whole" aspect of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A) by citing to the statute's legislative history. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 13-15. <span class="Italic">Pastor</span>, however, preceded <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>. In <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the court found that the legislative history cited in <span class="Italic">Pastor</span> was "merely a general statement about the purpose of the statute." <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1343. Indeed, the Board subsequently recognized that Congress intended a narrow construction of "consequential damages" in the 1994 amendments to the WPA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 13. In <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, the Board found that the AJ erred in "expansively interpret[ing] 'consequential damages.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant's claim for interest as consequential damages implicates the "no interest rule." In <span class="Italic">Krape v. Department of Defense</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430 &#x00B6; 9 (2004), the Board quoted <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 311 (1986), in noting that "interest cannot be recovered in a suit against the Government in the absence of an express waiver of sovereign immunity from an award of interest." The Board further cited the explanation of <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> in <span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 719 (Fed. Cir. 1991). There, the court found that <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> set forth two principles. First, it rejected any distinction between types of awards for purposes of the no-interest rule so long as the award compensated for the time value of money. Second, it found that no award in the nature of interest against the United States is permitted unless expressly and unambiguously authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">Krape</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430 &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) does not contain an express and unambiguous authorization for awarding interest as consequential damages. As previously noted, consequential damages cover only items similar to the specific items listed in the statute, i.e., back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, and travel expenses. <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1342. Those items do not include interest or anything that could be interpreted as compensation for the time value of money. Thus, we conclude that consequential damages do not include the interest that the appellant seeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even if consequential damages could be interpreted to include that interest, the appellant has not shown that the interest was a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of the agency's 1998 reprisal against her. An agency may not offer early retirement under VERA to an employee who has been removed for misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.114. Even though the appellant had received an ID reversing her removal for misconduct, that ID did not become final until the Board's July 2003 Order. Thus, the agency's decision not to offer her VERA and VSIP in May 2002 was in accordance with the statute and regulation and not in reprisal for her protected whistleblowing. Because the appellant has failed to show agency reprisal in declining to process her VERA and VSIP application in May 2002, she has consequently failed to show that she is entitled to consequential damages for the interest she allegedly lost because of the delay in processing and the related interest on her lump-sum payment for annual leave. <span class="Italic">Cf. Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 246 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14 (2004) (upholding the agency's decision not to pay interest on William's back-pay award absent an administrative decision finding that he was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next asserts that the AJ erred in not awarding her consequential damages for the increased tax liability she incurred when she received both a lump-sum back pay award and a lump-sum CSRS annuity benefits award in 2003. She reiterates the emphasis in <span class="Italic">Pastor</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609,<span class="Italic"></span> on the WPA's remedial nature. The appellant contends that the AJ erred in finding that she submitted insufficient evidence to substantiate her claim, and that she is entitled to $24,388.01. In that regard, she argues that prior Board decisions denying payment for tax consequences did not involve consequential damages under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show that the AJ erred in declining to grant consequential damages for her increased tax liability. As discussed above, the general statement in <span class="Italic">Pastor</span> does not provide a basis for a specific consequential damages award. Further, it is unnecessary to address the sufficiency of the appellant's evidence because she has not shown that her increased tax liability should be considered consequential damages. Specifically, she has provided no support for finding that the statute expressly waives the federal government's sovereign immunity for such an award or that it is similar to the specific items the statute identifies as recoverable consequential damages. In that regard, she has not explained why the Board should treat her argument concerning increased tax liability resulting from receipt of her awards any differently from the way it treats such arguments in cases not involving the WPA where the appellants have been awarded lump-sum back pay because of unwarranted personnel actions. The Board has found that it lacks authority to order any remedy for the tax consequences of a back-pay award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holtgrewe v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 137, 140 (1994). Moreover, the appellant again has not shown that her increased tax burden in 2003 was a reasonable and foreseeable consequence of her 1998 improper removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the AJ did not address her claim for consequential damages for the denial of interest on the lump-sum CSRS annuity caused by the agency's delay in processing her retirement application. She asserts that she requested $2,248.24 for interest accrued from June 1, 2002, through October 30, 2003. She cites <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 91 (2001), as allowing for the possibility of interest in such a situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that she is entitled to such consequential damages. Therefore, any adjudicatory error in failing to address her claim did not prejudice her substantive rights and provides no basis for reversing the<span class="Italic"></span> ID. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984). Although in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> the Board allowed for the possibility of interest on a lump-sum alternative annuity payment, it specifically found that "[t]he propriety of an award of interest is not properly an issue in the instant appeal" and, thus, declined to address the issue. <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 91 &#x00B6; 6. In any event, <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> did not involve the situation presented in this case. Here, the appellant's claim to interest is based on the same general argument considered and rejected above, that is, that the agency acted in reprisal against her by not processing her retirement application until October 2003. As already discussed, she has not established that the interest she seeks should be considered consequential damages causally related to the agency's 1998 action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the AJ also did not address her claim for "denial of pay for sick leave that [she] lost by reason of the agency's not restoring same during the interim relief period, which caused [her] to accrue LWOP during interim relief illnesses, and, that subsequently was forfeited upon OPM's processing of [her] retirement application as same was not in 'full months.'" The appellant asserts that she was forced to take LWOP during the interim-relief period because the agency had not restored her pre-removal sick leave. She further asserts that, although the pre-removal sick leave was ultimately credited in computing her CSRS retirement annuity, she lost 55 hours of sick leave because OPM credited only sick leave that added up to full years and months. She contends that the Board addressed the issue in <span class="Italic">Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 625, <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 632 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 10 Fed. Appx. 912 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and found that Coffey was entitled to use his pre-removal sick leave, instead of annual leave, during the interim-relief period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, the appellant has not shown that she is entitled to consequential damages for the alleged denial of 55 hours of sick leave. Therefore, any adjudicatory error in failing to address her claim provides no basis for reversing the ID. <span class="Italic">See Panter</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 282. <span class="Italic">Coffey</span> involved a compliance matter, and, thus, addressed Coffey's entitlement to sick leave retroactively in the context of full relief, not interim relief. <span class="Italic">Coffey</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. at 628-30. The purpose of interim relief is not to make the appellant whole at the interim relief stage of the proceedings; rather, it is to provide the limited relief of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(b)(2)(A) until a final decision is issued. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McIntire v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 578, 582 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, the present case involves the appellant's possible entitlement to consequential damages, not to interim relief. Granted, the Board has allowed for the possibility that sick leave may be considered compensable as "medical costs incurred" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See Carson</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 440 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15. Even if the lost sick leave could be considered consequential damages, though, the appellant has still not shown that it was causally related to the agency's 1998 reprisal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6; 15. Rather, the appellant did not return to work after May 31, 2002, because she believed that she was entitled to early retirement. As found above, the appellant has failed to show that the agency's decision not to grant early retirement at that time was reprisal for her whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a cross-PFR contesting the AJ's award of the $12,291.07 for interest the appellant paid until September 10, 2003, on loans for money that she had borrowed between 1998 and 2002 ($4,839.02); interest she lost on funds she had to spend from inheritances she received in 2000 ($6,749.43); interest she lost on an IRA she opened in 2001 that she had to withdraw early ($452.62); and the IRA early withdrawal penalty ($250). The agency asserts that the award is not substantiated by the record. It further asserts that the appellant has not <span id="Page_4947"></span>shown that her need to take out loans and withdraw savings was related to her removal, stating that the appellant was otherwise employed during a substantial part of the time that she was removed from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed above, we find that the appellant has not shown that the interest and penalty should be considered consequential damages. Further, she has not shown that these items were reasonable and foreseeable consequences of the agency's reprisal. Thus, despite any agency failure to contest those amounts below, the Board may not award them. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Carson</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 440 &#x00B6; 11 (addressing, on the Board's own motion, the issue of whether consequential damages include the appellant's use of annual leave, sick leave, and LWOP<span class="Italic"></span> because "payments of money from the public fisc 'are limited to those authorized by statute,' and we cannot grant the appellant a money remedy that Congress has not authorized.") Accordingly, we find that the AJ erred in awarding the $12,291.07 as consequential damages.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pastor v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/PASTOR_JOAN_L_PH_1221_99_0089_P_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_251004.pdf">87 MSPR 609</a>, 614-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-19 (2001), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Pastor v. VA</span>, 94 MSPR 353 (2003), <span class="Italic">post</span>, an IRA case, determined that consequential damages awards may include future medical expenses:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether future medical costs are recoverable under section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) is an issue of first impression with the Board. The administrative judge's interpretation of the phrase "medical costs incurred" is not an unreasonable one. However, as explained below, we find that the interpretation which most comports with congressional intent is one which allows an appellant to claim future medical costs resulting from the retaliatory personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA is remedial legislation, intended to expand and improve protections afforded federal employees who are whistleblowers<span class="Italic">. See Massimino v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 58 MSPR 318, 324 (1993); <span class="Italic">Mulherin v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force,</span> 45 MSPR 289, 291 (1990). In general, remedial statutes are to be liberally construed. <span class="Italic">See</span> Sutherland Stat. Const. &#x00A7; 60.01 (5th ed. 1992). Further, the whole of a statute should be considered in ascertaining its meaning, <span class="Italic">Sterling Federal Systems, Inc. v. Goldin,</span> 16 F.3d 1177, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1994), and the provisions of a unified statutory scheme should be read in harmony, leaving no provision inoperative or superfluous or redundant or contradictory, <span class="Italic">Holley v. United States,</span> 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(g)(1)(A)(i) provides that a person who has been the subject of retaliation for whistleblowing activity "be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred." The legislative history cited by the administrative judge reflects Congress' intent that an appellant who prevails in an IRA appeal be made whole, as nearly as possible, and recover the losses suffered as a result of the retaliatory conduct. Where a statute's stated purpose is to make an individual whole for losses suffered on account of a prohibited practice and to place her, as nearly as possible, in the position she would have been in but for the illegal action, the tribunal should fashion "the most complete relief possible" within the terms of the statute. <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody,</span> 422 U.S. 405, 421, 95 S. Ct. 2362, 2373 (1975).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To make an appellant whole, section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) authorizes the Board to award medical costs "incurred" as part of consequential damages. If, as the administrative judge found, that term is construed to include only medical expenses that have been incurred as of the date of the closing of the record in the consequential damages phase of a Board proceeding, an appellant's ability to claim her losses will be arbitrarily cut short depending on how quickly her case is adjudicated. Such a result would not comport with the make-whole provision of section 1221(g)(1)(A)(i), which contemplates that the agency will be required to pay for medical treatment to the extent necessary to alleviate, as much as possible, the results of its retaliatory acts. As explained below, such treatment includes future medical expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress is presumed to know the law. <span class="Italic">Cannon v. University of Chicago,</span> 441 U.S. 677, 696-98, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 1957-1958 (1979). Where, as here, Congress uses a legal term, a tribunal should interpret that term in its "familiar legal sense," <span class="Italic">Henry v. United States,</span> 251 U.S. 393, 395, 40 S. Ct. 185, 186 (1920), unless Congress has provided a "contrary direction," <span class="Italic">Morissette v. United States,</span> 342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S. Ct. 240, 250 (1952); <span class="Italic">see also Florida National Guard v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 699 F.2d 1082, 1087 (11th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 464 U.S. 1007 (1983) ("Congress is deemed to know the...judicial gloss given to certain language and thus adopts the existing interpretation unless it affirmatively acts to change the meaning."). For example, in determining the meaning of "punitive damages" in the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Supreme Court looked to the nature of that term as it is commonly applied in the law and adopted that usage, having found no reason to assume that Congress intended any other meaning. <span class="Italic">Molzof v. United States,</span> 502 U.S. 301, 306-07, 112 S. Ct. 711, 715-16 (1992).</p>

We therefore find that the term "consequential damages" encompasses future provable losses or expenses. Moreover, we discern no hint of a contrary intention either in the 1994 Act or its legislative history. Indeed, as pointed out above, the statute and its legislative history suggest that Congress intended to make prevailing appellants in IRA appeals as whole as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A statute is ambiguous if it is susceptible of differing, reasonable interpretations. <span class="Italic">De Jesus v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 63 MSPR 586, 592 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 62 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). The term "medical costs incurred" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) is ambiguous in that it could reasonably be interpreted, as the administrative judge did, to mean only medical costs that have already been incurred, or it could be read to also include future provable medical expenses. Where there is a silence or an ambiguity in a statute, the agency responsible for applying it--in this case the Board--must determine the proper interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Santella v. Special Counsel,</span> 86 MSPR 48 &#x00B6; 14 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing the term "medical costs incurred" we have considered that the WPA is remedial legislation which should be liberally interpreted. We have recognized that the 1994 Act, read as a whole, authorizes the Board to award relief that places the appellant, as nearly as possible, in the position she would have been in had not the agency retaliated against her. We have taken into account that the appellant might not be made whole if she were not reimbursed for provable future medical costs resulting from the agency's prohibited acts. We also have noted that the term "consequential damages," of which "medical costs incurred" is one statutory example, has been judicially interpreted to include various forms of future losses or expenses. Finally, neither the legislative history nor the statute indicates any intent by Congress to limit medical costs only to those incurred before the record closes in the Board proceeding. Indeed, as discussed above, if that were the case, an appellant's award of medical costs would depend on the arbitrariness of that closing date, irrespective of whether she has been placed, as near as possible, in the position in which she would have been had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred. Taking all of these factors into account, we find that the term "medical costs incurred" can include future medical expenses which are a result of the retaliation and which can be proven with reasonable certainty.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her consequential damages award, the administrative judge found that the appellant credibly testified that she could not meet her financial obligations following her reduction in grade and pay and that she sought other jobs at a higher salary and with a greater potential career ladder at the agency. Toward this end, the appellant applied, and was selected, for a position with the agency in Los Angeles, California, in October 2009; prior to this transfer, the appellant had been domiciled in Texas. After being selected for the California position, the appellant sold her house in Texas at a loss through a short sale and entered into a compromise with the VA for the outstanding balance of $64,949.00 on <span id="Page_4948"></span>her mortgage. Documents submitted below reflect that the VA absorbed this loss and that, although the appellant is not obligated to repay the VA this amount, she is not entitled to apply for another VA loan until it is repaid in full. The appellant, moreover, testified that the compromised loan amount appears on her credit history. In her addendum initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant was entitled to reimbursement for the compromised loan amount as a consequential damage caused by the agency's whistleblower reprisal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing the agency's challenge to the administrative judge's award of $64,949.00, we begin with the proposition articulated in <span class="Italic">Bohac</span> that "Congress intended a narrow construction of 'consequential damages.'" <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1342. Applying the rule of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, the court held that an award of consequential damages must be "of the same kind" as those specifically articulated in the statute: lost back pay and benefits, medical costs, or travel expenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Board has declined to restore either annual leave used, or leave without pay (LWOP) incurred, to pursue a Board appeal as part of a consequential damages award. <span class="Italic">See Carson</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 13 (declining to award LWOP); <span class="Italic">Reams v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2002) (declining to restore annual leave). It also has found that awards of interest and compensation for an increased tax liability are beyond the scope of recoverable consequential damages. <span class="Italic">See Johnston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In keeping with the Board's historical approach toward awards of consequential damages, we cannot conclude that the compromised loan amount resulting from the short sale of the appellant's home is recoverable. First, the compromised loan amount is not similar in nature to the other types of consequential damages specified in the statute, i.e., lost back pay, medical costs, or travel expenses. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 14 (any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages should be read to cover only items similar in nature to those listed in the statute). The compromised loan amount, rather, is more like those categories of damages which the Board has declined to award under section 1221(g). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18, 21 (declining to award a lump-sum interest payment on restored leave and additional compensation for increased tax liability); <span class="Italic">Reams</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 14 (reversing an award of annual leave used to prosecute a Board appeal). Applying the doctrine of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, we find that section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii)'s "any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]" language does not provide for the recovery of the compromised loan amount following the short sale of the appellant's house.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we find that the compromised loan amount is not a reasonable and foreseeable consequential damage which is causally related to the agency's reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Johnston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 13. The appellant testified that, among other things, upon her reduction in grade and pay, she could not cover her living expenses and felt compelled to seek employment elsewhere. She applied, and was selected, for a higher-paying position with the agency in Los Angeles, California, and thereafter elected to sell her home in Texas at a loss through a short sale. However, we find that, in between the agency's reprisal and the appellant's decision to sell her house and move to California, there were several intervening events which break the causal link needed to establish an entitlement to a consequential damages award. <span class="Italic">See Johnston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 13. For example, the appellant could have applied for and received a position closer to where she resided in Texas (either with the agency or another employer), thus eliminating the need for her to move or sell her house. Alternatively, she could have accepted the position in California, but kept her house,[6] or she might not have had to sell her house at a loss had she negotiated a different price or had the housing market been stronger. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. Restatement (Second) of Torts &#x00A7; 433(b) (1965) (relevant considerations when considering whether an actor's conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another include "whether the actor's conduct has created a force or series of forces which are in continuous and active operation up until the time of the harm").[7] As illustrated above, we cannot conclude that the agency's prohibited personnel practice created a "series of forces which [were] in continuous and active operation" through the appellant's decision to sell her home at a loss and enter into a compromise with the VA. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Torts &#x00A7; 440 (a superseding cause is that of a third person or other force which by its intervention prevents the actor from being liable for harm to another).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;There is evidence in the record that, prior to the challenged reduction in grade and pay, the appellant was in line for a temporary overseas assignment and that she had planned on renting her house while abroad. We find it within the range of possibility that the appellant could have rented her house in Texas instead of selling it at a loss.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Federal Circuit found that contract law principles did not squarely address the scope of recoverable consequential damages under section 1221. <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1340-41. Rather, courts traditionally have looked to tort law when considering the elements of employment discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar</span>, 133 S. Ct. 2517, 2525 (2013). We therefore find the Restatement of Torts persuasive authority on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further agree with the agency's argument on review that there is no evidence in the record that the appellant has experienced an actual, compensable monetary loss or out-of-pocket expense.[8] <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1342 (consequential damages are limited to actual monetary losses or out-of-pocket expenses). As explained above, upon the sale of the appellant's house, she entered into a compromise with the VA for the outstanding amount of her loan, which does not require that she repay the VA <span class="Italic">unless and until</span> she wishes to be eligible for another VA loan. The appellant, therefore, can present no evidence that she has incurred an actual monetary loss, all she has lost is the eligibility to apply for a VA loan, and we agree with the agency that the loss generated upon the sale of the appellant's house has been sustained by the VA and not by her. The appellant's ineligibility to secure another VA loan, moreover, is best categorized as a nonpecuniary consequence which falls outside of the scope of recovery under section 1221(g). <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1342. Similarly, we find that the reference to the loan compromise on the appellant's credit history is also nonpecuniary in nature and cannot justify an award of consequential damages.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The fact that the appellant has not personally sustained an actual monetary loss or out-of-pocket expense only adds support to our decision, and had the appellant personally sustained an actual monetary loss on the sale of her house, we would reach the same conclusion that the loss is not within the scope of recoverable consequential damages under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;We note, for example, that, even if we were to award the appellant this sum, there is no guarantee that she would repay the VA this amount, in which case the reference to the compromised loan would remain on her credit history. Additionally, even if the <span id="Page_4949"></span>appellant were to repay the VA this amount, it is not clear that her credit history would be expunged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the remedial purpose of the consequential damages provision of section 1221(g) does not warrant a different result. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(i) ("corrective action may include...that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred"); <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1343 (discussing the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to section 1221(g)). In <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Federal Circuit found that the statute's legislative history could not support a reading that Congress intended to allow prevailing parties to recover nonpecuniary losses in consequential damages awards. <span class="Italic">See Bohac</span>, 239 F.3d at 1343. Although the Board had previously cited the statute's "make-whole" language and its legislative history to support an expansive reading of the scope of recovery under section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), <span class="Italic">see Pastor v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2001) (finding that an award of future medical costs may be awarded under section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii)), subsequent to <span class="Italic">Bohac</span>, the Board has eschewed reliance on the broad make-whole language of the statute, instead recognizing that Congress intended a narrow construction of the consequential damages provision, <span class="Italic">see Johnston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 78, &#x00B6; 16. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the appellant is not entitled to a consequential damages award covering the compromised loan amount. Accordingly, the administrative judge's award of $64,949.00 in consequential damages is REVERSED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The administrative judge's remaining consequential damages award is AFFIRMED.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has not challenged the administrative judge's consequential damages award of $3,871.20 in moving expenses, $2,418.02 in travel costs, and 280 restored sick leave hours.

Additionally, although the Board has previously withheld deciding whether sick leave used as a result of the agency's whistleblower reprisal would be compensable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), <span class="Italic">see Carson</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 15 n.9, here, where there is unrefuted evidence in the record demonstrating the appellant's increased use of sick leave following the agency's prohibited personnel practice, along with supporting medical documentation, <span class="Italic">see</span> HCD; DF, Tabs 46-47 (the appellant's medical documentation and leave history), we find that sick leave used as a result of the agency's whistleblower reprisal is a recoverable consequential damage as a medical cost incurred under section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii). The administrative judge's award of 280 restored sick leave hours is AFFIRMED.</p>

While discussing retroactivity, the Board considered the scope of the consequential damages provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3(a) of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) states that if an appellant is the prevailing party before the Board based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice, "the agency involved shall be liable to [him] for reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred." Pub. L. No. 101-12, 3(a), 103 Stat. 16, 30 (1989). This provision of the WPA was codified at 5 USC 1221(g)(1). In 1994, Congress amended section 1221(g) by providing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that if the Board orders corrective action in an IRA appeal, "such corrective action may include back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of October 29, 1994 (1994 Act), Pub. L. No. 103-424, 8(b)(2), 108 Stat. 4361, 4365. The Board has found that although this amendment, which is codified at 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), "refers to consequential 'changes,' it is apparent that consequential 'damages' were intended." <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 386, 388 n.2 (1996). Thus, the appellant properly based his claim for consequential damages on 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the 1994 Act, Congress provided that "[t]he provisions of this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall be effective on and after the date of the enactment of this Act," October 29, 1994.

Because the personnel action took place nearly four years before the enactment of the 1994 Act, the appellant would not be entitled to consequential damages if 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) does not apply retroactively, assuming that he properly filed his request for such damages with the administrative judge....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party argues on petition for review that the administrative judge erred in giving retroactive effect to section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).

Ct. at 1505. If the tribunal finds that Congress has not done so, it must determine whether the statute should have retroactive effect based on a determination of whether retroactivity would "impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court applied the "traditional" presumption against giving a statute retroactive effect to find that certain provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L.

Among the provisions that did not apply retroactively was one authorizing the recovery of compensatory damages for intentional discrimination violative of Title VII. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 282, 114 S. Ct. at 1506. The Court held that the compensatory damages provision did not apply retroactively because it attached "an important new legal burden" to conduct that took place before the enactment of the 1991 Act, and it conferred a "new right to monetary relief" under Title VII. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 283, 114 S. Ct. at 1506. Acknowledging that retroactive application of the compensatory damages provision might vindicate the purpose of the statute more fully, the Court nonetheless found that this consideration was insufficient to rebut the presumption against retroactivity, which "is founded upon sound considerations of general policy and practice, and accords with long held and widely shared expectations about the usual operation of legislation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 286, 114 S.

Hence, the Court held that the traditional presumption against giving a statute retroactive effect should be used when determining whether a particular provision of the 1994 Act applies in an appeal, such as this one, involving conduct that occurred before October 29, 1994. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1371.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the principles set forth in <span class="Italic">Landgraf</span>, the Court found that the 1994 Act's classification of a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination as a "personnel action" does not apply retroactively because that provision "clearly imposes new duties on government officials wishing to utilize fitness-for-duty examinations, and arguably...could increase a government official's liability for past conduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1371.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, we find that the consequential damages provision of the 1994 Act, 5 USC 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), attached a new legal burden to conduct that took place before its enactment and conferred a new right to monetary relief under the WPA.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the administrative judge's certification of an interlocutory appeal of his ruling that the Board lacks authority to award nonpecuniary damages for mental distress under the consequential damages provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act. As detailed below, we find that the administrative judge's ruling is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">BACKGROUND</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant prevailed in her appeal which contended that she had been coerced into seeking a geographic reassignment because of acts taken in reprisal for whistleblowing activities. <span class="Italic">Kinney v. Department of Agriculture</span>, MSPB Docket No. SE-1221-96-0569-W-1 (Initial Decision, May 6, 1998). The initial decision became final and the appellant moved for <span id="Page_4950"></span>consequential damages, based in significant part on emotional distress. After requesting briefs on the issue, the administrative judge held that the Board lacks authority to award nonpecuniary damages for mental distress under the consequential damages provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) of Title 5 of the United States Code authorizes the Board, in cases where it orders corrective action for actions taken in reprisal for whistleblowing, to award "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." Since the Board's final decision on the merits granted the appellant corrective action, reversing her reassignment after finding that she was coerced into requesting it by acts taken in reprisal for whistleblowing in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302 (b)(8), there is no question that this provision for consequential damages applies to her. The question, however, is whether the statute authorizes the Board to award monetary damages for nonpecuniary harm or whether any award is limited to out-of-pocket losses. As explained below, we find that the statute does not consent to governmental liability for damages based on emotional distress, i.e., for pain and suffering.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1221(g)(1)(A) authorizes the Board's corrective action orders in covered appeals to include prospective relief in subsection (i) and retrospective, monetary relief in subsection (ii). The appellant's claim for damages relies on the concluding phrase of the latter section, "and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]." This general language follows a list of specific authorized forms of relief, "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, [and] travel expenses." The rule of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> (of the same kind), an established principle of statutory construction, requires that a general statutory term be understood in light of the specific terms that surround it. <span class="Italic">Hughey v.</span> <span class="Italic">United States,</span> 495 U.S. 411, 419 (1990). The rule mandates that a catchall phrase such as that relied on by the appellant be read as applying only to categories similar to those specifically enumerated<span class="Italic">. Federal Maritime Commission v.</span> <span class="Italic">Seatrain Lines, Inc.,</span> 411 U.S. 726, 734 (1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The justification for <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> is that, if the general language were literally interpreted to have the widest possible application, the specific examples would be superfluous. The rule avoids the redundancy of the specific examples by giving them the function of defining the limits of the general language. It recognizes that the purpose of describing a class by examples and a general catchall phrase is to indicate how extensively a provision is intended to be applied. 2A <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction, &#x00A7;&#x00A7;</span> 47.17-47.18 (N. Singer, 5th ed. 1992)<span class="Italic">. See United States v. Thomas,</span> 930 F.2d 526, 529 (7th Cir. 1991). Here, where the statute authorizes the Board to order the agency to reimburse the appellant for specific out of pocket losses and expenses resulting from the unjustified action, the rule dictates that the phrase, "and other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages," be read only to authorize reimbursement for other resulting monetary losses. The language cannot be read to extend the award of consequential damages to include nonpecuniary injuries such as emotional or mental distress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the restrictive interpretation of statutory language called for by the principle of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> does not apply where there is a clear manifestation of a contrary intent. <span class="Italic">Sutherland, supra, &#x00A7;</span> 47.22. No such intent can be found elsewhere in the statute or in the sparse legislative history of section 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii) and its parallel section, 1214(g)(1), however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A single sentence in the Senate Report accompanying the 1994 Act addresses the two provisions expanding the authority to award attorney fees and adding the authority to award back pay, medical costs, travel expenses, and other consequential damages: "Section 8 allows the Board to order corrective action that will make, as nearly as possible, the individual whole." S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3559. Although this language could be read in an expansive manner, the other reference to these provisions in the legislative history strongly leads in the opposite direction. The House bill, H.R. 2970, as introduced in the House on August 6, 1993, as voted out of the Subcommittee on Civil Service on October 20, 1993, as voted out of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service on August 10, 1994, and as described in the House report, H. Rep. No. 103-769, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. (1994), contained provisions related to the recovery of "fees for legal representation" but made no reference to damages. Prior to the House vote on the amended Senate version adding these sections, the bill's sponsor stated with reference to them that "[t]he expanded provisions for consequential damages and attorney fees are intended to provide a realistic expectation that employees who prevail will recover their costs." 140 Cong. Rec. H11421 (daily ed., Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey). Nonpecuniary damages, such as pain and suffering or emotional distress, are not ordinarily viewed as "costs." Read together, these two brief references in the legislative history suggest that the purpose of the statute is to make a prevailing appellant financially whole. Most assuredly, they provide no clear manifestation of a legislative intent to provide compensation for nonpecuniary losses which would require the <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> rule to be disregarded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the absence of any reference in the legislative history to an intent to authorize damages for pain and suffering is in marked contrast to the history of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which added 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a providing for awards of compensatory damages to employees prevailing on claims of discrimination. The history of that provision expressly states that damages for emotional or mental distress were authorized, and the issue of whether excessive damage awards might result from enactment was debated in the committee reports<span class="Italic">. See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 102-40(I), at 14-15, 64-65, 70-74, 108 (1991), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1991 USCCAN at 552-53, 602-03, 608-10, 646; H.R. Rep. No. 102-40(11), at 24-29, 42-43, 70-71 (1991), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1991 USCCAN at 717-22, 736-37, 756-57. Moreover, section 1981a(b)(3) places a ceiling on the amount of damages that can be awarded. The omission of such a provision from the 1994 Act and the lack of expressions of concern in the history about the potential cost impact of the consequential damages provisions are consistent with the narrow reading required by the <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis rule.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the consequential damages provisions are waivers of sovereign immunity. The scope of provisions which consent to governmental liability must be interpreted narrowly in favor of the sovereign, <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996), and should not be enlarged beyond what the statutory language requires<span class="Italic">. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,</span> 503 U.S. 30, 34 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we conclude, as the administrative judge did, that damages for mental or emotional suffering are not authorized by section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The exclusion of damages for emotional distress for whistleblowing reprisal was confirmed by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bohac v. USDA</span>, <a href="http://openjurist.org/239/f3d/1334/janice-bohac-v-department-of-agriculture">239 F.3d 1334</a>, 1338-43 (Fed. Cir. 2001), involving an adverse action appeal from a removal decided before the 2012 statutory changes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset we are confronted by the inconvenient fact that the WPA does not in fact provide for the recovery of consequential "damages," although both parties urge us to treat it as though it did. Rather, as enacted, and as it appears in the Statutes at Large and in the U.S. Code, the provision, 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), allows recovery for "consequential changes." The reference to "changes" is obviously a mistake.[3] It is well-established that an appellate court may interpret statutes to correct such obvious mistakes. <span class="Italic">See United States Nat'l Bank of Or. v. lndep. Ins. Agents of Am.</span>, 508 U.S. 439, 462 (1993) (disregarding a scrivener's error on punctuation because it was against the "overwhelming evidence from the structure, language, and subject matter of the...Act"); <span class="Italic">United States v. Colon-Ortiz</span>, 866 F.2d 6, 10 (1st Cir.) (finding that extra language was "an inadvertent drafting error, and should be stricken from the statute," and that "in legislative (as in judicial) affairs, allowance must be made for human error and inadvertence"), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1051 (1989); 2A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and</span> <span class="Italic">Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 46.06, at 192-93 (6th ed. 2000). This is such a situation where it is appropriate for us to interpret the statute by disregarding an obvious mistake in the text of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has consistently agreed, holding that although the "statutory provision refers to consequential 'changes'...it is apparent that consequential 'damages' were intended." <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 386, 388 n.2 (1996); <span class="Italic">see also Kinney v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 82 MSPR 338, 339-40, <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed</span>, 215 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (unpublished disposition); <span class="Italic">Hasler v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 79 MSPR 415, 422 n.2 (1998) (Vice Chair Slavet, dissenting).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question, however, becomes: what was the mistake? The parties urge that "changes" in section 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) was intended to be "damages." However, it is also possible that "changes" was intended to be "charges." On balance, we think that the parties' reading is correct. Section 1214(g) of title 5, the counterpart provision of section 1221(g) for actions brought by the OSC rather than as an individual right of action, provides for recovery of "consequential damages." These two provisions were enacted at the same time in the 1994 Amendment, and contain nearly identical language. Pub. L. 103-424, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8(a) and (b)(2), 108 Stat. 4361, 4364-65. The inference is strong that Congress intended the same scope of recovery under section 1221(g) as under section 1214(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, the legislative history apparently does not contain any references to "changes" but instead refers to "damages." 140 Cong. Rec. H11421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey) ("[t]he expanded provisions for consequential <span class="Italic">damages</span> and attorney fees are intended to provide a realistic expectation that employees who prevail will recover their costs...." (emphasis added)). We conclude that "changes" should be construed to be "damages" in section 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As might be expected, the parties urge opposite positions with respect to the interpretation of the phrase "consequential damages." Petitioner suggests that Congress intended to incorporate the contract law concept of consequential damages, meaning foreseeable damages, as <span id="Page_4951"></span>most famously announced in <span class="Italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span>, 9 Ex. 341, 156 Eng. Rep. 145 (1854), and that non-pecuniary damages are recoverable. The government, on the other hand, urges that the term refers to pecuniary damages by which it means reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs. While the issue is not free from doubt, we conclude that the government is correct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because this is a suit against the government, we cannot allow recovery unless there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court ruled in <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996), that a "waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text...and will not be implied." <span class="Italic">See also United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.</span>, 503 U.S. 30, 33-34 (1992). Moreover, a waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign. <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, 518 U.S. at 192; <span class="Italic">Nordic Village</span>, 503 U.S. at 34; <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 318 (1986). While the Supreme Court recently appears to have allowed greater latitude for interpreting the scope of sovereign immunity waivers in the light of "statutory purposes, history, and the absence of convincing reason for denying" a waiver, <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, 527 U.S. 212, 222 (1999), we are satisfied that even under the more liberal standard of <span class="Italic">West v. Gibson</span>, the petitioner's interpretation must fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the term "consequential damages" does not have a well-established common law meaning that includes non-pecuniary damages. In interpreting a Congressional statute using common law terminology, there is a presumption that Congress intended the common law meaning. As the Supreme Court noted in <span class="Italic">Morissette v. United States</span>, 342 U.S. 246, 263 (1952), "where Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice" it is presumed to know and adopt the common law concepts. It is therefore a "settled principle of statutory construction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms." <span class="Italic">United States v. Shabani</span>, 513 U.S. 10, 13 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also United States v. Wells</span>, 519 U.S. 482, 491 (1997) (articulating the presumption "that Congress incorporates the common-law meaning of the terms it uses if those terms have accumulated settled meaning under the common law and the statute does not otherwise dictate" (quoting <span class="Italic">Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden</span>, 503 U.S. 318, 322 (1992)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Many of the authorities discussing the term "consequential damages" cited by the parties here do not reflect common law usage at all. Instead they reflect casual use by courts to describe particular types of damages or use of the term in a variety of other statutory contexts. The usage in those contexts varies considerably, and the authorities are essentially unhelpful.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229, 239 (1992) (stating that "[n]othing in this remedial scheme [of Title VII prior to the Civil Rights Act of 1991] purports to recompense a...plaintiff for any of the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm to reputation, or <span class="Italic">other consequential damages</span> (e.g., a ruined credit rating)" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">Schweiker v. Chilicky</span>, 487 U.S. 412, 425, 436-37 (1988) (Brennan, J., dissenting) (discussing how the "continuing disability review" program statute provides for "economic consequential damages" which does not include damages for "emotional or dignitary harms"); <span class="Italic">Lutz Farms v. Asgrow Seed Co.</span>, 948 F.2d 638, 646 (10th Cir. 1991) (upholding district court finding that defendant's attempted exclusion of "consequential damages" by a limitation on the bottom of an invoice was void because it was unconscionable); Ga.

Code Ann. &#x00A7; 11-4-402(b) (defining a bank's liability to its customer for damages caused by wrongful dishonor and limiting bank's liability to "actual damages proved...and damages for arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages"); Ga.

<p class="Block-Quote1">More pertinently, petitioner urges us to apply the common law contract law concept of "consequential damages," including the foreseeability test of <span class="Italic">Hadley v. Baxendale</span>. Even if we were to assume, as petitioner urges, that Congress intended to incorporate the meaning of the phrase "consequential damages" from contract law, this does not suggest the result that petitioner seeks. The concept of "consequential damages" in contract law relates to the concept of foreseeability at the time the contract is executed, not, as the petitioner would have it, foreseeability at the time of the breach<span class="Italic">. See Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. United States</span>, 801 F.2d 1295, 1300 (Fed. Cir. 1986); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 351(1), cmt. a (1979); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 11 Samuel Williston, <span class="Italic">Williston on Contracts</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1347, 1348, at 251-53, 259 (3d ed. 1968). In general, this has led the courts to limit recovery to pecuniary damages, which are most likely to be foreseeable at the time of contracting, as opposed to non-pecuniary damages, which are more dependent on the circumstances of the individual plaintiff at the time of the breach. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pierce v. Int'l Ins. Co. of Ill.</span>, 671 A.2d 1361, 1367 (Del. 1996); <span class="Italic">Stanback v. Stanback</span>, 254 S.E.2d 611, 616-17 (N.C. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases have focused particularly on damages for emotional distress. Under the traditional contract law approach, "[i]t is well established that, as a general rule, no damages will be awarded for the mental distress or emotional trauma that may be caused by a breach of contract."

Perillo, <span class="Italic">The Law of</span> <span class="Italic">Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 14.5(b), at 549 (4th ed. 1998); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Williston, <span class="Italic">Williston on Contracts</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1338, 1341, at 200, 214; Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 353. To be sure there are exceptions, such as contracts of carriers and innkeepers with passengers and guests, contracts for the carriage or proper disposition of dead bodies, and contracts for the delivery of messages concerning death. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 353 cmt. a; 5 Arthur L. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1076, at 434 (1964). In these cases, however, breach of the contract is particularly likely to cause serious emotional disturbance. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 353, cmt. a. Moreover, with the limited exception of contracts for the delivery of messages concerning death, damages for mental suffering are usually refused absent wanton and willful misconduct. Corbin, <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> &#x00A7; 1076, at 434. Ordinary negligence does not suffice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case clearly does not fit into any of these categories of cases for which awards of mental suffering were awarded for breach of contract at common law. Indeed, a whistleblowing claim seems most closely akin to a claim for wrongful discharge and, historically, at common law only traditional contract damages were recoverable for such claims. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2 Mark A. Rothstein <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Employment Law</span> &#x00A7; 8.21, at 315-16 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner cites a number of wrongful discharge cases beginning in the 1980s, such as <span class="Italic">Wiskonotoni v. Michigan National Bank-West</span>, 716 F.2d 378 (6th Cir. 1983) and <span class="Italic">Smith v. Atlas Off-Shore Boat Service, Inc.</span>, 653 F.2d 1057 (5th Cir. 1981), which have allowed emotional distress damages. Such wrongful discharge claims are sometimes based in contract and sometimes in tort. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Rothstein <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, <span class="Italic">Employment</span> <span class="Italic">Law</span> &#x00A7; 8.21, at 315-16; Mark A. Player, <span class="Italic">Employment Discrimination Law</span> &#x00A7; 1.06a, at 11-12 (1988). Some courts, such as those in <span class="Italic">Wiskontoni</span> and <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, have upheld awards of emotional distress damages for wrongful discharge where public policy concerns are implicated. Others have refused to award emotional distress damages for wrongful discharge, thereby limiting damages to ordinary contract damages. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Francis v. Lee Enters, Inc.</span>, 971 P.2d 707, 708 (Haw. 1999) (rejecting cause of action for breach of employment contract based in torts, and limiting emotional distress damages to situations where parties specifically provided for them in contract); <span class="Italic">Hummer v. Evans</span>, 923 P.2d 981, 987 (Idaho 1996) (breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing in at-will employment context raises claim under contract law, not tort law). Thus, while the common law limits on wrongful discharge damages may have changed in at least some states, it is clear that historically there was no uniform common law rule in this area allowing recovery of non-pecuniary damages, much less an established common law meaning of the term "consequential damages" that would include non-pecuniary damages in the context of contract law. We have also been unable to determine that the term "consequential damages" has any well-defined common law meaning in the tort context, and neither party urges that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, if Congress had intended to allow broad recovery for non-pecuniary damages, it seems likely that it would have used the well-understood term "compensatory damages." "'Compensatory damages' are the damages awarded to a person as compensation, indemnity or restitution for harm sustained by him." Restatement (Second) of Torts &#x00A7; 903 (1979). Compensatory damages are divided into two categories: pecuniary and non-pecuniary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 905 and 906. Non-pecuniary compensatory damages include compensation for bodily harm and emotional distress, and are awarded without proof of pecuniary loss. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 905. It is well-understood that the term "compensatory damages" includes non-pecuniary damages such as pain and suffering. For example, when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, adding 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a, it expressly provided for awards of "compensatory and punitive damages" to employees prevailing on claims of discrimination. 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(a)(1). Congress provided a precise definition of "compensatory and punitive damages" in the Civil Rights Act, listing "future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses" in the language of the statute itself, and then set limits on the amount that an award for these damages could total. 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981a(b)(3). Unlike the Civil Rights Act of 1991, section 1221 of the WPA neither expressly grants "compensatory damages" nor lists examples of the types of damages that would include non-pecuniary damages. This comparison illustrates that Congress knows how to provide damages for non-pecuniary losses, including pain and suffering, when it so desires. It did not do so in the 1994 amendments to the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, petitioner points to a language difference between sections 1214(g) and 1221(g). Section 1214 provides for "<span class="Italic">reimbursement for attorney's fees</span>, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, <span id="Page_4952"></span>and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages," while section 1221 simply provides "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]." <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii) (emphasis added). The difference in language is most likely explained by the fact that section 1214 includes attorney's fees in the list of damages that "may" be awarded, while section 1221 treats attorney's fees separately, mandating that they "shall" be awarded. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g). Indeed, the use of the term "reimbursement" in section 1214, and the intended parallelism between sections 1214 and 1221 is further confirmation that section 1221, like section 1214, was designed to allow only for reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Petitioner urges that the term "consequential damages" must include nonpecuniary damages because not all prohibited personnel actions cause pecuniary damages. In particular, petitioner argues that the 1994 amendments expanded the definition of these "personnel actions" which may constitute a prohibited personnel action to also include certain actions that allegedly do not cause pecuniary damages. For example, petitioner notes that the 1994 amendments, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 5(a), 108 Stat. 4361, 4363, added "a decision to order psychiatric testing or examination" to the prohibited personnel actions listed at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). We do not agree with petitioner's assertion that these personnel actions could not result in out-of-pocket expenses being incurred. For example, an order to undergo psychiatric testing could certainly result in the employee incurring medical bills and other expenses. In any event, even if not all prohibited personnel actions in fact result in pecuniary damages, the main remedy for a prohibited personnel action is a "corrective action" which restores the employee to his or her previous position, or a position with equivalent pay and status. Congress did not assume that all prohibited personnel actions necessarily cause consequential damages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, application of the interpretive rule of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii) leads us to the conclusion that Congress intended a narrow construction of "consequential damages" in the 1994 amendment to the WPA. "Under the rule of <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, which means 'of the same kind,' where an enumeration of specific things is followed by a general word or phrase, the general word or phrase is held to refer to things of the same kind as those specified." <span class="Italic">Sports Graphics, Inc. v. United States</span>, 24 F.3d 1390, 1392 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 2A Norman J. Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47.17, at 273-74 (6th ed. 2000) ("Where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words."). It is appropriate to apply <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span> in interpreting the language of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221 (g)(1)(A)(ii). The section includes a list of three specific authorized forms of relief: (1) back pay and related benefits; (2) medical costs incurred; and (3) travel expenses. The section then includes a concluding phrase: "and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]." Under <span class="Italic">ejusdem generis</span>, the general phrase "any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential [damages]" should be read to cover only items similar in nature to the specific items. In this case, the three specifically listed items are all actual monetary losses or out-of-pocket expenses. None of these items includes non-pecuniary damages such as those sought by petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to the WPA makes no reference to compensatory damages or the types of damages for which recovery is now sought. There is a noticeable lack of discussion concerning the type of damages that an aggrieved party may receive. For example, two references in the Senate Report to damages available to a prevailing whistleblower hardly endorse the petitioners theory. The Senate Report states that "a prevailing whistleblower is entitled to attorneys' fee and any other reasonable costs incurred directly or indirectly by the whistleblower in connection with the litigation." S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 8 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3557 (emphasis added). This statement does not suggest an intention to expand the damages available to also include non-pecuniary damages. The petitioner further relies on a statement in the Senate Report that the Act "allows the Board to order corrective action that will make, as nearly as possible, the individual 'whole.'" S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3559. This is merely a general statement about the purpose of the statute and does not contradict the government's interpretation of the statute. Contrary to petitioner's assertions, making an individual "whole" does not mean that the individual is entitled to non-pecuniary losses. Rather, this statement could just as easily mean that an individual will be wholly reimbursed for his out-of-pocket or pecuniary losses. The House Committee Report for the proposed 1994 amendments discusses making a whistleblower "whole" in the context of reimbursement of expenses. That report, H.R. Rep. No. 103-769, at 18 (1994), for example, criticizes a body of case law that "does not permit employees to be made whole through payment of <span class="Italic">consequential expenses</span> incurred as a result of an improper personnel action." (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CONCLUSION</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all of these reasons we conclude that the term "consequential damages" in section 1221(g) is limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and does not include non-pecuniary damages.</p>
