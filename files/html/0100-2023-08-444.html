<p class="Body-Text">Employment practice cases challenged allegedly irrational examining practices administered by OPM to select administrative law judges. <span class="Italic">Etelson v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 610, 611 (1987) (Board was not divested of jurisdiction because appellant was also challenging his individual rating before OPM); <span class="Italic">Etelson v. OPM</span>, 684 F.2d 918 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (involving a previous effort by Mr. Etelson to obtain judicial revision of ALJ examining practices); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Devine</span>, 736 F.2d 1108 (6th Cir. 1984) (considering whether an annuitant could compel the OPM to certify him as a candidate for an ALJ position); <span class="Italic">Dugan v. Ramsay</span>, 727 F.2d 192 (1st Cir. 1984) (reviewing OPM qualifications and assessment standards for evaluating lawyers applying for ALJ positions); <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 87, 93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2000) (challenge to the bias of the ALJ examining system against SSA lawyers resulted in a remand for hearing); <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 648 (1993) (examining and sustaining OPM's determination that an annuitant may not compete for an ALJ position), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">on motion for stay</span>, <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 239 (1995) (denying a stay of enforcement). [Refer to the earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-425.html#sec1-419">Examples of Regulation Review</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-08-426.html#sec1-420">Administrative Law Judge Examination Authority</a>."] On July 10, 2018, President Trump issued E.O. "Excepting Administrative Law Judges from the Competitive Service," with allowing agencies to appoint ALJs into the excepted service without the examination process traditionally administered by OPM. <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/13/2018-15202/excepting-administrative-law-judges-from-the-competitive-service">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/07/13/2018-15202/excepting-administrative-law-judges-from-the-competitive-service</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For an example of a judicial opinion considering the burdens of proof concerning a challenge to OPM's rating system for prospective ALJs, <span class="Italic">Curtin v. OPM</span>, 846 F.2d 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1988), should be reviewed. Broadly construing the jurisdiction of the Board over employment practices, the Federal Circuit concluded that a challenge to the suspension by OPM of ALJ examinations pending development of a new examination was an employment practice within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Bush v. OPM</span>, 315 F.3d 1358, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 603-04 (Fed. Cir. 1994), analyzed a bar to the appointment of civil service annuitants to ALJ positions. Although the court's decision is devoted in large part to a narrow question concerning the status of a reemployed annuitant, the decision interprets Board jurisdiction to review the qualification standards applied directly and indirectly by OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government asserts that the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Mr. Vesser's appeal because Mr. Vesser's disqualification from reemployment as an ALJ was the result of a statutory bar and not the result of an agency hiring practice. According to the Government, this distinction is significant because it is only the latter that may be termed an "employment practice" as defined in 5 CFR 300.101, the misapplication of which may be appealed to the Board under 5 CFR 300.104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employment practices are defined in the regulations to include "the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." 5 CFR 300.101. The threshold issue, therefore, is whether the action taken is an employment practice within the meaning of the regulations. The Government urges a narrow interpretation of employment practices as being the kinds of "measurement instruments" that determine a candidate's ability to perform the duties and responsibilities of a job, such as the examination that found Mr. Vesser qualified to be considered for an ALJ position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, as noted by the Board, this Court held in <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720 (Fed. Cir. 1983), that the term employment practices has a "naturally broad and inclusive meaning." Additionally, in direct contrast to the Government's contention, the Court in <span class="Italic">Dowd</span> stated that "the inclusive definition of employment practices cannot reasonably be read to apply narrowly to tests alone." <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 724.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, employment practices include qualification standards. Applying the requisite broad and inclusive meaning to the term employment practices, we hold that the Board, in removing Mr. Vesser's name from the register of eligible ALJ candidates based on his status as an annuitant, used a qualification standard under 5 CFR 300.101. We accordingly agree with the Board that an employment practice was applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second step in the jurisdiction analysis is whether the application of the employment practice violates a "basic requirement" because "only those who believe that an employment practice has been applied to him in a manner that violates a "basic requirement," as defined in 5 CFR 300.103, are entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 CFR 300.104. Section 300.103, entitled "Basic requirements," mandates that an employment practice be (a) based on a "job analysis" that sets forth the duties of and qualifications for the position, (b) relevant to performance in the position, and (c) not discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Dowd</span>, 713 F.2d at 722, n.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, &#x00A7; 300.103(a)(3) sets forth that employment practices of the Federal Government be based on a job analysis including the "factors that are important in evaluating candidates." Mr. Vesser's status as an annuitant was not only an important but a determinative factor in OPM's evaluation of him as an ALJ candidate. We therefore hold that a basic requirement as defined in section 300.103 was involved in the removal of Mr. Vesser's name from the ALJ register.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that Mr. Vesser was entitled to appeal the removal of his name from the register of eligible ALJ candidates because such action was an employment practice that may violate a basic requirement as defined in &#x00A7; 300.103. The Board therefore correctly determined that it had jurisdiction over this appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Vesser's case returned to the Board, and the Board provided only the remedy that it directs when finding that an applicant for employment has improperly been deemed by OPM to be unsuitable for appointment: restoration to the rolls of eligibles and priority consideration. <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 282, 285 (1994). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Azdell v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hannon v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 613, 617-18 (1997), considered another challenge to OPM ALJ examination and appointment procedures. Although the Board lacked jurisdiction under an employment practice challenge to consider the performance by an individual in the examination process, the Board affirmed its authority to consider allegations of discriminatory rating criteria, e.g., preferences allegedly granted to women or minorities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board's and OPM's regulations specifically provide that the Board has jurisdiction over claims that an OPM "employment practice" violates a basic requirement of 5 CFR 300.103. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.3(a)(19); 5 CFR 300.104(a). Here, that is exactly what the appellant alleges. In <span class="Italic">Post v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPB 272, 5 MSPR 226, 227-28 (1981), the Board reversed an initial decision finding that an allegation of a discriminatory "employment practice" brought under 5 CFR 300.104(a) was not within the Board's jurisdiction. The Board remanded that appeal for the administrative judge to consider the appellant's claims that an OPM "employment practice" was tainted with unlawful discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Board has held that it has jurisdiction over claims that an "employment practice" is generally applied in a discriminatory fashion or is inherently biased against a particular group of individuals. <span class="Italic">Dow</span>, 68 MSPR at 289; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1377-78 (considering the claim that the ALJ examination was biased in favor of certain applicants); <span class="Italic">Beam</span>, 61 MSPR at 58-60 (finding Board jurisdiction where the appellant alleged that an "employment practice" was tainted with partisan political discrimination). Thus, contrary to the administrative judge's finding, the Board has jurisdiction over a claim that an OPM employment practice is discriminatory even in the absence of some other matter within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant has alleged that OPM took steps to increase the scores of women and minorities, that the relative scores of white males were lowered, and that these actions were discriminatory. If the appellant <span id="Page_851"></span>were to prove these allegations, he would establish that OPM engaged in an unlawful employment practice over which the Board has jurisdiction. Thus, it is necessary to remand this appeal to the administrative judge for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 87, 90 n.1 (2000), involving an ALJ examination challenge, declared that "[i]t is well settled that the Board lacks jurisdiction to review an individual's score on a particular examination but that it does have jurisdiction to consider whether an employment practice such as an examination is applied in a discriminatory fashion or is inherently biased against a certain group of individuals." Following remand, the Board issued a merits decision in <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM</span>, 96 MSPR 548, 550-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-29 (2004) (remanded for a merits hearing, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM,</span> 144 Fed. Appx. 877 (Fed. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>), concluding that the appellant did not establish that the OPM evaluation system improperly discounted the experience of SSA Office of Hearings and Appeals attorneys who sought placement as ALJs through the OPM examination process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is employed as a staff attorney by the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) in Mobile, Alabama. In 1993, he filed an application with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under that agency's administrative law judge (ALJ) examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the ALJ examination, OPM assigned numerical scores based on the qualifications of the applicants. Each eligible candidate's overall score--as well as the candidate's standing on the ALJ register relative to the other candidates--was based on ratings assigned with respect to four parts of the examination. One of those parts--and the only part at issue in this appeal--was the Supplemental Qualifications Statement (SQS), a statement in which a candidate was to describe experience he had had that was relevant to his qualifications for an ALJ position. A candidate's SQS score made up 50 per cent of the total scores received on all four parts of the examination. Only candidates whose SQS scores were sufficiently high were permitted to complete the other three parts of the examination. Moreover, the candidate's SQS score largely determined whether the candidate would be among those permitted to complete the other parts of the examination relatively soon after receiving his SQS score. Because the appellant received an SQS score below 22--his score of 21 was described as "in the lower range of the minimum qualifying score"--the appellant was in the group of candidates who were the last ones scheduled to complete the other parts of the examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant attempted to appeal his SQS score to OPM, but was advised that the score could not be reconsidered until he completed the examination. In January 1997, after the appellant had completed the ALJ examination process, OPM notified the appellant that it had lowered his SQS score to 14.[1] At the appellant's request, however, it subsequently reconsidered the score, and in February 1998 it notified the appellant that his score had been raised to 18. About 3 months later, the appellant filed this appeal with the Board's Atlanta Regional Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;OPM has indicated that the appellant took the examination again before his SQS score was lowered. The appellant, however, has denied that he took the examination again during this time, and has stated that "OPM unilaterally lowered appellant's SQS score from 21 to 14 without giving a reason or explanation to appellant." We see no need to resolve this apparent dispute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant alleged that the ALJ examination was unfair to OHA attorneys. Specifically, he alleged that OPM "systematically gave...very low SQS scores" to "three classes of OHA attorneys"; that those "classes" consisted of "regional attor[n]eys," "supervisory attorneys," and "GS-13 qualified attorneys"; and that the low scores given to those attorneys prevented the attorneys' selection for ALJ positions....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as untimely filed. The appellant petitioned for review of that decision, however, and the Board reversed the decision, finding that the appellant had shown good cause for his untimeliness. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 87 (2000), reopening request denied, 90 M.S.P.R. 124 (2001). It also found that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. Part 300, and it remanded the appeal for further consideration.<span class="Italic"> id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After allowing the parties to engage in discovery, and after holding a hearing, the administrative judge issued his remand initial decision. In that decision, he found that the appellant had failed to prove, by preponderant evidence, that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal. Specifically, he found that the appellant had failed to prove that certain "benchmark" examples used by OPM in calculating individual SQS scores were inherently biased against OHA attorneys, and that he also had failed to prove that OPM had otherwise engaged in a practice of crediting OHA attorneys with fewer SQS points than their experience warranted. He also noted that he had "rejected any evidence and argument" related to the appellant's argument that OPM had improperly delayed issuance of his final rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has petitioned for review of the remand initial decision, arguing that he did establish jurisdiction below, that the administrative judge erred in declining to consider his claim that OPM improperly delayed issuance of his final rating, and that the record showed that OPM had discriminated against OHA attorneys. OPM has responded in opposition to the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, each employment practice of the federal government must meet the following basic requirements: (1) It must be based on a job analysis identifying the basic duties and responsibilities of the job in question, the knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform those duties and responsibilities, and the factors that are important in evaluating candidates; (2) there must be a rational relationship between the employment practice and performance in the position to be filled, and demonstration of the existence of this rational relationship must include a showing that the employment practice was professionally developed; and (3) the employment practice may not discriminate on the basis of a nonmerit factor. A candidate who believes that an employment practice that OPM has applied to him violates one of these basic requirements may file an appeal with the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who has filed an appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) has the burden of proving, by preponderant evidence, that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)] . This burden does not, however, require him to prove that the practice at issue was improper; instead, the appellant is required only to show that OPM applied to him, or caused to be applied to him, an employment practice that he believes violated a requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">See Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 773 F.2d 313, 315-17 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (although the "rule of three" that was the subject of the petitioner's part 300 appeal was "lawful and was rightly applied to" the petitioner, it was an employment practice OPM had caused to be applied to the petitioner, and the Board therefore had jurisdiction over the petitioner's appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a)), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1049 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant has alleged that the benchmark examples mentioned above are biased against OHA attorneys. The agency has argued that the appellant failed to establish jurisdiction over his claim regarding this matter. In making this argument, it has relied on testimony, by an OPM employee with experience rating applications under the ALJ examination, that raters used benchmarks only when they were unable to determine the appropriate number of points to award on an element of the SQS examination by using "proficiency level definitions." It also has noted that the same official indicated in her testimony that she relied on benchmarks "[l]ess than half" of the time she spent on the SQS part of the examination, and that she indicated further that it was impossible to determine from examination records which of the SQS element scores were based on benchmarks and which were based on proficiency level definitions. This evidence shows, according to OPM, that the appellant was unable to establish, by preponderant evidence, that the benchmarks were actually applied to him. While the administrative judge did not adopt this reasoning entirely, he took a similar approach. That is, he found that the appellant had "failed to prove that OPM engaged in a 'practice' of using the benchmark achievement examples repeatedly enough to significantly impact the SQS scores of OHA attorney applicants."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by this reasoning. While the appellant has focused on terminology used in certain benchmark examples, he alleged in doing so that those examples reflected a bias against OHA attorneys that was inherent in OPM's scoring of the SQS part of the ALJ examination. When viewed as whole, therefore, the appellant's claim concerns the SQS part of the ALJ examination, and not just the benchmark examples used to score that part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perhaps more important, OPM did not award benchmark-based points that were separate from or in addition to any other SQS points it awarded. In the materials used in scoring this part of the examination, it described six SQS elements; and under each element it defined five different levels of experience, each warranting a different number of points. After each of these proficiency level definitions, it included several benchmark examples, each of those consisting of a description of experience that had been rated at the level that had just been defined. It is clear, under these circumstances, that OPM intended the benchmarks to serve only as illustrations or examples of work the test-developers regarded as warranting the assignment of the number of points provided in the corresponding proficiency level definition. Accordingly, considering them as an employment practice separate from the rest of the SQS part of the ALJ examination would be inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101, the term "employment practices" includes, for purposes of 5 C.F.R. subpart 300A, "the development and use of...tests[ ] and other measurement instruments." Clearly, the SQS is a test OPM uses to measure applicants' qualifications for ALJ positions. We find, therefore, that the SQS part of the ALJ examination is an "employment practice" that may be the subject of an appeal to the Board under 5 C.F.R. <span id="Page_852"></span>&#x00A7; 300.104(a). Moreover, there is no doubt that the test was applied to the appellant, and the appellant has alleged that it violated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 by discriminating against OHA attorneys such as he on a nonmerit basis. Accordingly, we find that the Board has jurisdiction, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), over this appeal as it concerns OPM's scoring of the SQS part of the ALJ examination. <span class="Italic">See Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 315-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in declining to consider his claim that OPM improperly delayed issuance of his final rating. In support of this argument, he asserts that his claim concerns a practice by OPM to delay the issuance of final ratings of OHA attorneys in general, and that it does not simply concern a delay affecting him alone, as the administrative judge allegedly indicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine whether delaying the issuance of ratings constitutes an employment practice, and whether it therefore may, under some circumstances, be the subject of an appeal under 5 C.F.R. subpart 300A. Even if it does, the appellant in effect acknowledges that the delay at issue was simply the result of the receipt of relatively low SQS scores. Moreover, the record shows that applicants receiving relatively high SQS scores were scheduled for early completion of the examination, while those with the lowest scores were scheduled last. We find, under these circumstances, that the alleged delaying of the issuance of OHA attorneys' final ratings is not an issue separate from the allegedly unfair scoring of those attorneys' applications, and that it therefore need not be considered separately.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once an appellant has established jurisdiction over a claim under 5 C.F.R. subpart 300A, OPM has the burden of proving, by preponderant evidence, that the employment practice at issue meets the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 133 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 39-41 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 88 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">and vacated</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 40 (2003), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, No. 03-624 (Mar. 1, 2004); <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 125, 131 (1990). In this case, perhaps because the administrative judge found that jurisdiction had not been established, the parties were never informed of this burden, and the administrative judge made no finding as to whether the practice at issue here, i.e., the SQS part of the ALJ examination, had been shown by preponderant evidence to meet the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. Instead, he placed on the appellant the burden of establishing that the "benchmark" examples at issue here were inherently biased against OHA attorneys.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that remanding this appeal is not necessary. Although the parties, like the administrative judge, evidently believed they were addressing only jurisdictional issues below, they in fact addressed the merits of this appeal as well, i.e., the issue of whether the SQS part of the ALJ examination met the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. Moreover, we see no need for any credibility determinations based on witness demeanor. Finally, we find, for the reasons stated below, that, despite the administrative judge's failure to advise OPM of its burden of proving that the employment practice at issue met the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, the record includes sufficient evidence to satisfy this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we note that the record includes transcripts of testimony by Sherry Turpenoff, the director of the office responsible for developing and administering the ALJ examination, that the examination was based on the kind of job analysis required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a), and that it met the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b) that it be professionally developed and that it measure qualifications relevant to the jobs to be filled.[7] Ms. Turpenoff indicated in her testimony that the examination, including the SQS portion, was based on a job analysis; that there had been "subsequent studies" after the initial job analysis on which the examination was based; that testing methods related to the SQS (and specifically related to the benchmarks used in that part of the examination) were supported by "extensive validity evidence" and statistical analysis; that they were "developed in accordance with generally acceptable testing procedures"; and that the job analysis ensured that the examination in fact measured "what it is the job requires."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Ms. Turpenoff's testimony was given in connection with the other Board appeal to which the appellant relied in his petition for appeal, i.e., the appeal in which another administrative judge had found a similar claim by an OHA attorney substantiated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the record includes testimony from Ms. Turpenoff's predecessor, John Flannery, who indicated that the persons responsible for developing the relevant parts of the ALJ examination were professionals in the field, i.e., psychologists. It also includes a 1993 letter in which Mr. Flannery stated that personnel psychologists had conducted validity studies of the examination in 1979 and 1989. The appellant has not questioned the accuracy of any of this evidence; he has not claimed that the employment practice at issue here was not based on a proper job analysis, that it was not professionally developed, or--except to the limited extent described below--that it failed to meet the relevancy requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b). In addition, we note that the Board previously has found that the SQS part of an earlier version of the ALJ examination met the regulatory requirements mentioned above, and that our reviewing court has upheld this finding. <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1375-78 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (the court was "convinced that the board properly analyzed and applied the policies and requirements of the regulations relating to employment practices to the facts").[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;While an additional SQS element has been added since the application at issue in <span class="Italic">Curtin</span> was rated, we see no indication of any fundamental change in the SQS part of the examination. Moreover, while the issues in <span class="Italic">Curtin</span> were not entirely the same as those present in the case now before us, the applicant in that case did raise a challenge similar to the one raised here. <span class="Italic">See Curtin</span>, 846 F.2d at 1375-77 (indicating that appellant objected to SQS part of examination on ground, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that it "contain[ed] a bias in favor of applicants who have more varied job experience"). We therefore regard <span class="Italic">Curtin</span> as lending support to a finding that OPM has met its burden of proving compliance with the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the appellant has alleged that the SQS part of the ALJ examination unfairly discriminates against OHA attorneys. In support of this allegation, he has referred to testimony indicating that relatively high SQS scores are assigned for experience that attorneys are unlikely to gain at OHA, such as litigation experience. Implicit in this argument is the appellant's belief that this alleged preference for experience in litigation and other areas to which OHA work is not likely to expose its attorneys constitutes discrimination on a nonmerit basis. The argument also could be regarded as challenging OPM's compliance with the relevancy requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does include evidence that the SQS part of the ALJ examination favors applicants who have had litigation and other varied legal experience that they are not likely to receive at OHA. Specifically, it includes Mr. Flannery's deposition testimony that "historically the staff attorneys in the Social Security Administration and other attorneys did not fare as well on the [ALJ] exam as certain other attorneys, particularly attorneys with strong litigation experience, trial experience, et cetera," and that this was true because "a number of...attorneys" in agencies other than SSA "did have stronger trial, courtroom experience, or varied experience." Mr. Flannery also indicated that SSA attorney work might have received relatively low SQS scores because "much of it was seen as being very standardized, standardized paragraphs with just minor changes for each particular case."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that a scoring system that favors some kinds of experience over other kinds does not necessarily violate the regulatory requirements at issue here; that there may instead be a rational relationship between that experience and performance as an ALJ; and that other statements by Mr. Flannery indicate that the allegedly favored litigation and other experience was in fact relevant to performance in the ALJ positions to be filled. Mr. Flannery indicated, for example, that litigation and varied legal experience were favored because the examination was intended "to recruit and hire...people who could handle themselves well and who ha[d] demonstrated themselves well in a hearing room or in a court," and to "better ensure that whoever was hired was going to be an effective administrative law judge, keeping in mind these are virtually lifetime positions, no annual performance rating." He also indicated, in a letter he wrote to another applicant in 1993, that experts who had participated in the most recent studies of the validity of the ALJ examination had "consistently taken a strong stand in maintaining that trial or hearing room experience [was] highly valuable experience for an ALJ applicant to have and [that it] should, of itself, be given significant weight in the rating process." Furthermore, it is obvious that experience writing relatively standardized documents would not be as valuable as less standardized legal writing experience. In addition, Ms. Turpenoff's testimony, cited above, that the SQS and other parts of the ALJ examination were based on a job analysis and subsequent studies to ensure their validity and relevance to ALJ positions provides significant support for a finding that, to the extent OPM tended to assign relatively few SQS points for OHA experience, this tendency did not violate any requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that, to the extent the perceptions of the general nature of SSA experience described in Mr. Flannery's testimony are unsupported by applicants' descriptions of their work experience, a preponderance of the evidence in the record shows that they would not adversely affect applicants with SSA experience. Although the appellant has attempted to show that SSA employees received lower SQS scores regardless of their actual current or prior experience (including non-OHA experience), the evidence he has offered is weak, consisting largely of anecdotal evidence that some SSA attorneys with litigation or other favored experience received low SQS scores despite that experience. This evidence is outweighed by the unequivocal testimony of Juanita Love, <span id="Page_853"></span>an OPM employee with experience in rating SQS submissions, that an applicant's job title had no effect on the applicant's SQS rating, that she was told not to score the examinations based on job type or job title, and that applicants employed by OHA were not "pegged to receive specific scores on the SQS merely because of their job titles." Moreover, this testimony is consistent with Ms. Love's subsequent statement that scores were based on "how the applicant described his responsibilities and accomplishments...." Ms. Love also indicated in her testimony that prior experience was credited to the same extent as current experience. That is, she indicated that the SQS score was not affected by the timing of the experience, and that whether an applicant's experience received the credit it warranted depended on whether the applicant had included a description of that experience in his SQS submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that the appellant presented a chart depicting SQS scores OHA employees had received, and that the chart indicates that not all OHA employees received the same score. Instead, the scores on the chart range from 20 to 24.[11] This also indicates to us that SQS scoring was based on the substance of the experience the applicant described, and not on the applicant's job title or place of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The highest available SQS score evidently is 30, and the lowest evidently is 5 (test material, indicating that applicants were given from one to five points on each of six elements of the SQS).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant does not appear to allege specifically that the substantive content of the benchmark examples is biased against OHA or SSA attorneys. Instead, while he asserts generally that all the examples are "inherently biased against OHA attorneys," his specific assertions in support of that claim concern only two of the examples. One of those examples allegedly is biased because it indicates that some of the work described there was performed for OHA, and another allegedly is biased because it refers to certain work as that of a "law clerk (staff attorney)," a term he believes is associated with OHA attorney work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that the benchmark examples are excerpts of actual SQS submissions, and that they are redacted to protect the privacy of the applicants who submitted them. While the redactions appear to remove the names of states, courts, universities, and other specific institutions, they do not remove general job titles or general descriptions of the institutions in which the jobs were located. The failure to redact information identifying the applicant as having held, among other positions, that of "an attorney advisor for the Office of Hearings and Appeals" therefore is not inconsistent with OPM's general practice with respect to redactions. Moreover, because the number of OHA attorneys who have filed applications under the ALJ examination seems to be quite large, there would appear to be no need for further redaction in order to protect the privacy of the applicant whose SQS submission has been included in the testing material. In addition, we note that the appellant received more points in the SQS element to which this benchmark related, i.e., "Knowledge of Administrative Procedures, Rules of Evidence, and Trial Practices," than the benchmark example received, despite the appellant's having identified himself in his SQS submission as an OHA attorney.[13] That is, the appellant received four SQS points in this element, while the experience described in the benchmark example received only three. We see no indication, therefore, that OPM's failure to redact the reference to OHA reflects a bias against OHA experience, that it indicates an intent that all OHA experience was to be given the same number of points on this element as were given to the experience described in this benchmark example, or that it has been applied in a manner that has that effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The administrative judge declined to admit this exhibit, which consists of a copy of the appellant's SQS submission; and the appellant has objected on petition for review to its exclusion. While we agree with the administrative judge that the exhibit generally is not relevant and material to the issues in this case, we have considered it for the limited purpose indicated above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument...is even less persuasive. This example does not even refer to OHA or SSA. Furthermore, the appellant's experience in this element (i.e., the element of "Analytical Ability") received four points--two points higher than were assigned on the basis of the experience described in the benchmark example. This also undermines the appellant's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that OPM has proven, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the SQS part of the ALJ examination meets the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, including the provision of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c) prohibiting an employment practice from discriminating on the basis of a nonmerit factor. The appellant's request for corrective action accordingly is DENIED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sent the <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span> case back to the Board for a merits hearing, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM,</span> 144 Fed. Appx. 877, 880 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that application of benchmark scores is too narrow an interpretation of what O'Leary alleged. Rather, although "focus[ing] on terminology used in certain benchmark examples, he alleged in doing so that those examples reflected a bias against OHA attorneys that was inherent in OPM's scoring of the SQS part of the ALJ examination." This theory, whatever its merits, does not depend on O'Leary receiving the precise benchmark scores in the OPM guidelines. The record provides us with no basis to overrule the Board's conclusion that, "[w]hen viewed as a whole,...the appellant's claim concerns the SQS part of the ALJ examination, and not just the benchmark examples used to score that part." There is no dispute that the SQS scoring practice was applied to O'Leary, even if the precise benchmark scores themselves were not. Thus, O'Leary's claim satisfies the jurisdictional requirement that the allegedly discriminatory practice was actually applied to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having established jurisdiction, we have disposed of the only issue disputed by the parties on appeal. We agree with O'Leary and the government that O'Leary is entitled to a hearing on the merits, because the hearing that O'Leary received before the administrative judge was designated jurisdictional.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appeal having returned for the required hearing, the Board reaffirmed its conclusion that the OPM ALJ examination scheme met the regulatory requirements of job-relatedness and professional development, <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. OPM,</span> 104 MSPR 451, 453-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, 2007 MSPB 6 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1993, the appellant in this case, a staff attorney in the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Social Security Administration (SSA), filed an application under the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Examination. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which developed and administers that examination, reviewed the appellant's supplemental qualifications statement (SQS)--a document describing the applicant's relevant work experience--and assigned him a score of 21. As indicated in our 2004 decision in this case, the SQS is only one of four parts of the ALJ Examination, but the score that may be assigned under this part is equal to the total of the scores that may be assigned under all three other parts. Moreover, only candidates whose SQS scores are sufficiently high are permitted to complete the other three parts of the examination relatively soon after receiving their SQS scores. Because the appellant received a score "in the lower range of the minimum qualifying score," he was in the last group of applicants scheduled to complete the remaining parts of the examination. After he completed those remaining parts, OPM lowered his SQS score from 21 to 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(b), a candidate may challenge his examination rating by filing an appeal with OPM. The appellant did so, and his SQS score was raised to 18. He later filed this employment practice appeal with the Board's Atlanta Regional Office under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), alleging that the SQS part of the ALJ Examination discriminated against staff attorneys employed in SSA's OHA. The administrative judge to whom the appeal was assigned issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as untimely, but the Board reversed that decision, finding that the appellant had shown good cause for his untimeliness. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 87 (2000), <span class="Italic">reopening request denied</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 124 (2001). On remand, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-300A-98-0635-B-4 (Initial Decision, Apr. 22, 2003). Again, however, the Board reversed the administrative judge's initial decision. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 1 (2004). In doing so, it found that it had jurisdiction over the appeal; it noted that the administrative judge had held a hearing; and, although he had characterized the hearing as one addressing the issue of jurisdiction, the Board found that the parties had in fact addressed the merits of the appeal, that OPM had met its burden of proving that the SQS part of the ALJ Examination met the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, and that remand was unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 18, 29. The Board accordingly denied the appellant's request for relief. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for judicial review of the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, No. 04-3466, slip op. at 1 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 9, 2005).1 Although the court concurred in the Board's finding that it had jurisdiction over this appeal, it found that the appellant was entitled to an additional hearing "because the hearing that [he] received before the administrative judge was designated jurisdictional." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 6-7. After holding another hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision in which he found that the appellant was not entitled to relief. <span class="Italic">O'Leary v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-300A-98-0635-M-1 (Initial Decision, Apr. 12, 2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a timely petition for review, arguing that the administrative judge erred in excluding relevant testimony from the hearing, in denying discovery requests he had made, and in evaluating the evidence. The agency has filed a timely response to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, in an appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a), OPM has the burden of proving that the employment practice that has been challenged meets the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. The first of these requirements is that the practice be based on a job analysis that identifies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_854"></span>(1)&#x2003;The basic duties and responsibilities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The factors that are important in evaluating candidates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(a). In our 2004 decision, we found that OPM had presented evidence that the SQS portion of the ALJ Examination was based on a job analysis that met these requirements, <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 19, and the administrative judge found similarly after supplementation of the record on remand. The appellant has not challenged this finding, either in his petition for review of the most recent initial decision or previously. We therefore find that the SQS portion of the ALJ Examination meets the job analysis requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second of the basic requirements is that of relevance. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b), there must be a rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled and the employment practice used. OPM must show, in connection with this requirement, that the employment practice was professionally developed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SQS scores on the examination at issue here were based on OPM's assessment of six elements of each applicant's experience, each element of which was rated on a scale of one to five, reflecting five levels of experience under that element. For each element, OPM provided its raters with a brief description of ALJs' duties and responsibilities relevant to that element, or of the skills they needed in that area. It then provided general descriptions of duties and responsibilities that would qualify for ratings at various levels of the element, followed by a number of "benchmark examples." Each benchmark example consisted of an excerpt from an actual ALJ Examination application, labeled to show the element to which the benchmark was relevant and the rating the benchmark would receive, i.e., the level that was applicable to that example.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our 2004 decision in this appeal, we found that the record included testimony that the persons responsible for developing the relevant parts of the examination were psychologists, i.e., professional employees, as well as evidence that personnel psychologists had conducted validity studies of the examination in 1979 and 1989. <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 20. We also indicated that, of all the appellant's claims, the only ones that seemed to concern the relevancy requirement were those in which the appellant alleged that the benchmarks treated OHA experience such as his less favorably than it treated other attorney experience. We indicated further that the appellant's more specific assertions regarding this matter were not supported by the record, and that, to the extent OHA experience was treated less favorably than other attorney experience, the difference was based on merit factors such as the relevance of experience in areas OHA attorneys were less likely than other attorneys to have. Based on the supplemented record, the administrative judge found no probative evidence to contradict the Board's findings in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review of the administrative judge's most recent initial decision in this case, the appellant focuses on the level definitions. He argues there, as he did below, that those definitions were not professionally developed; that they were instead written by the chief of operations in OPM's Office of Administrative Law Judges; that the persons OPM employed to rate SQS documents "should have used the benchmark achievement examples to score the submissions"; and that they instead "incorrectly scored SQS submissions by using the level point definitions." We note that the administrative judge referred in his initial decision to a "presumption that the test...is professionally developed." We see no basis for applying such a presumption. As indicated above and in our 2004 decision, OPM has the burden, in cases such as this, of proving by preponderant evidence that its employment practice meets all the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, including the requirement that the test be professionally developed. <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Azdell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 39-41 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd on recons.</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 88 (2001), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 540 U.S. 1218 (2004). We have reopened this appeal in order to clarify this matter and to address more fully the appellant's claim that the SQS portion of the ALJ Examination has not been shown to have been professionally developed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM official to whom the appellant has referred, in the argument described above, did indicate in testimony included in the record that she wrote the level definitions; and the record does not appear to indicate that she was a psychologist. Evidence that the definitions were not written by psychologists, however, does not preclude a finding that the examination of which they were a part was not professionally developed. As noted above, the benchmarks also were written by nonpsychologists, i.e., by applicants under the ALJ Examination. The issue here is not whether each SQS component was drafted by professional psychologists, but whether the test was developed consistent with professional standards and subjected to professional review. As we indicated in our 2004 decision and the administrative judge noted on remand, the record includes unrebutted evidence that the SQS portion of that examination--which includes both benchmarks and level definitions--was validated by personnel psychologists. <span class="Italic">O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 20<span class="Italic">.</span> It also was based on a professionally conducted job analysis. Therefore, while standards that eventually became part of the examination were not necessarily drafted by professional psychologists, a preponderance of the evidence establishes that the SQS portion of the examination was itself professionally developed.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's statement that the SQS raters should have applied the benchmarks, rather than the level definitions, also is not persuasive. Although the chief of operations indicated that she regarded the benchmarks as the primary tool for rating applicants, she did not indicate that the level definitions should not also be used. Instead, she described the level definitions as a guide to assist in the rating process. Moreover, the SQS test materials described above show clearly that the level definitions and benchmarks were intended to be applied together, with the benchmarks providing examples of experience that would meet the more general descriptions stated in the level definitions. <span class="Italic">See also O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6; 13 (OPM intended the benchmarks to serve only as illustrations or examples of work warranting certain scores, and "considering them as an employment practice separate from the rest of the SQS part of the ALJ examination [therefore] would be inappropriate").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also has renewed his allegation that the benchmarks are biased against OHA staff attorneys and therefore violate 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103(c), the third of the basic requirements, which is that employment practices shall not discriminate on the basis of nonmerit factors. He notes that benchmark 1-3-H, which provides an example of work warranting a rating of three points under element one, includes language indicating that it describes the work of an OHA staff attorney, and that no benchmarks corresponding to higher levels of any element include such a reference. He also argues that OPM raters' objectivity was compromised by the reference, and that OPM could have rectified the problem either by redacting the reference to OHA staff attorneys or by including benchmarks describing experience of OHA attorneys that warranted ratings of four or five.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes evidence that experience as an OHA staff attorney was associated with lower SQS ratings than those ratings assigned to attorneys in other agencies and other positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> (testimony, by former director of OPM's Office of Administrative Law Judges, that "quite a few" OHA staff attorneys "did not fare well on that part"). Moreover, benchmark 1-3-H, by indicating that the OHA staff attorney experience described there warranted three points, rather than four or five, supports the proposition that at least some aspects of experience viewed as typical of an OHA attorney were viewed less favorably than the experience of attorneys in other agencies and other positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A scoring system that favors some kinds of experience over other kinds, however, does not necessarily discriminate against applicants on a nonmerit factor. The benchmark to which the appellant specifically objects was intended to measure "Knowledge of Administrative Procedure, Rules of Evidence, and Trial Practices." Benchmarks for level five under the same element included experience as a state court judge who presided over lengthy civil and criminal trials, and those for level four included experience as a trial attorney who represented the general counsel of the attorney's agency before administrative law judges. The experience described in the latter two benchmarks would appear to provide significantly more valuable preparation for an ALJ position than the experience described in benchmark 1-3-H. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (benchmark 1-3-H, referring to activities such as attendance at hearings (as an OHA attorney), representation of clients in an apparently limited range of cases, and presiding over peer review committee hearings).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we see no need to modify our previous findings regarding the effect of the benchmarks' references to job titles. OHA employees did not receive uniform SQS scores; other evidence also indicates that job titles themselves did not dictate SQS scores; and the evidence as a whole provides a strong basis for finding that these references did not cause the SQS part of the ALJ Examination to discriminate against OHA applicants on a nonmerit basis. <span class="Italic">See O'Leary</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 548, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we conclude that OPM has met its burden of proving, by preponderant evidence, that the SQS part of the ALJ Examination under which the appellant applied meets the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>

The formula was contrary to the requirements of 5 CFR 300.103 (2022) because it was <span id="Page_855"></span>not based on a job analysis "to identify the basic duties and responsibilities, [and] the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities," and because it was not "rationally related to performance in the position to be filled, including a showing that the employment practice was professionally developed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 149 &#x00B6; 26.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Kurt Chadwell petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), which dismissed his September 15, 2008 appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Chadwell challenged the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM's") August 14, 2008 notice that it would not review or process his 2008 application for an administrative law judge ("AU") position because one year had not passed since the date he received a Notice of Results ("NOR") from his successful 2007 application for an ALJ position. Because OPM's one-year rule is not an employment practice, the Board does not have jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a).[1] We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) provides that "[a] candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Chadwell responded to OPM's May 4, 2007 ALJ vacancy notice, seeking to have his name added to the register of ALJ eligibles. OPM uses the register of eligibles as a source of referrals to respond to agency requests for lists of eligible candidates for open ALJ positions. On October 30, 2007, OPM issued a NOR notifying Mr. Chadwell of his successful completion of all parts of the ALJ examination. Mr. Chadwell received a final numerical rating and his name was added to the list of eligible ALJ candidates. OPM further advised Mr. Chadwell that "[i]f [he] received a NOR with a final numerical rating, [he] may retake the examination after one year has passed from the date of the final NOR and the examination opens to the receipt of new applications."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 30, 2008--approximately nine months after Mr. Chadwell received the NOR from his 2007 ALJ application--OPM issued the 2008 ALJ vacancy notice. Mr. Chadwell responded to the notice, seeking to retake the ALJ test and have his rating on the register of eligibles updated based on additional experience earned since his 2007 application. On August 14, 2008, OPM notified Mr. Chadwell that it would not review or process his 2008 ALJ application because one year had not passed since OPM had issued its final NOR from Mr. Chadwell's 2007 ALJ application. However, Mr. Chadwell's name remained on the register of eligibles based on his 2007 application rating and he continued to be considered for open ALJ positions. Mr. Chadwell appealed OPM's decision and application of the one-year rule to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the pendency of Mr. Chadwell's appeal, the Board's administrative judge issued two show cause orders advising Mr. Chadwell of his burden of proof as to whether the Board had jurisdiction over his allegation that OPM's application of the one-year rule constitutes an employment practice. Following the parties' responses to the orders, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing Mr. Chadwell's appeal of the agency action for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Chadwell petitioned for review. Upon review, the Board's chairman and vice chairman split on the disposition of the petition for review. Thus, the administrative judge's initial decision became the final decision of the Board. Mr. Chadwell appealed the Board's final decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a) (9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the Board has jurisdiction over this case rests on whether Mr. Chadwell can demonstrate that the agency's rule constitutes an "employment practice" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. Next, he must show that the employment practice was applied to him in violation of a basic requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. This second step, however, is not implicated by this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employment practice is defined as any practice that affects "the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101 further defines the purpose of employment practices and notes that the term "'employment practices' includes the development and use of examinations, qualifications standards, tests, and other measurement instruments." We have held that the term "employment practice" has a "naturally broad and inclusive meaning" and applies to rules having a substantive or merits-based effect on a candidate's eligibility for initial appointment. <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States,</span> 713 F.2d 720, 723 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Chadwell argues that the Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) because OPM refused to consider his 2008 ALA application pursuant to a rule that precludes an existing AIA candidate from reapplying until one year after issuance of a final NOR from a recent application. Mr. Chadwell asserts that the one-year rule constitutes an employment practice within the meaning of the regulations and was applied in violation of at least one of the basic requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More specifically, according to Mr. Chadwell, the one-year rule is an employment practice having a substantive or merits-based effect on the ranking of AIA candidates because (1) it precludes from consideration the class of individuals that have received their NOR less than one year prior to an ALJ vacancy announcement, and (2) it prevents an applicant from increasing his or her examination score based on additional experience earned during the period between receipt of the NOR and a new ALA vacancy announcement less than one year later. Regarding the latter, Mr. Chadwell asserts that after notification of his 2007 ALJ examination score he received two prestigious team awards in recognition of his performance as a federal government attorney. Based on those awards, Mr. Chadwell believes that the one-year rule "deprived him of the higher score he would have likely received" on the 2008 ALJ examination thereby adversely affecting his ranking and selection for initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government disagrees, contending that OPM's one-year rule is not an employment practice and that the Board therefore lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Chadwell's appeal. Specifically, the government asserts that the one-year rule is procedural because it "reflects an exercise of OPM's administrative discretion and is not a substantive or merits consideration that affects the qualification standards for the ALJ position." The government further asserts that the one-year rule is a "reasonable procedure for allocating OPM's limited resources." OPM explains that the one-year rule allows it to create a broader list of eligible candidates for appointment to open ALJ positions. OPM contends that allowing existing, eligible ALJ candidates to reapply less than one year after receiving a NOR would take away an otherwise available application slot from new applicants or those ALJ candidates that have waited more than one year to reapply.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In 2007, OPM capped the number of applications to the ALJ vacancy announcement at 1,250. OPM received that number of applications in less than one week. In 2008, OPM capped the number of applications to the ALJ vacancy announcement at 600.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government. Mr. Chadwell incorrectly argues that the one-year rule is an employment practice because it has a substantive or merits-based effect on his ranking or selection from the list of eligible ALA candidates. The appropriate analysis is not merely whether the rule has an effect on his ranking within the list of eligibles; it is whether the rule "affects the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals <span class="Italic">for initial appointment</span> and competitive promotion." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101 (emphasis added). OPM's one-year rule has no effect on Mr. Chadwell's eligibility for initial appointment. Despite being ineligible to retake the ALA examination in 2008, Mr. Chadwell remained on the list of eligibles for appointment to vacant ALJ positions based on his 2007 examination rating. Indeed, his name was submitted twice to the Social Security Administration in response to agency requests for lists of eligible candidates for open ALA positions. Thus, Mr. Chadwell incorrectly contends that the one-year rule precludes the class of individuals that have received a NOR less than one year prior to an ALJ vacancy announcement from consideration for initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Chadwell's argument that OPM's one-year rule prevents an applicant from raising his or her examination score based on increased experience earned in the period between receipt of the NOR and a new ALA vacancy announcement less than one year later is similarly unavailing. Mr. Chadwell's contention that his score would have increased based on receipt of various awards or additional experience is speculative, at best. For instance, Mr. Chadwell could have scored lower in 2008 than he did in 2007. Further, Mr. Chadwell's argument fails to consider that if other successful 2007 applicants were allowed to retake the ALJ exam in <span id="Page_856"></span>2008, they too might score higher based on their additional experience such that any increase in his personal score would be negated by the increased scores of other applicants. Mr. Chadwell was eligible to retake the ALJ examination in 2009 when his professional experience and awards earned following the 2007 examination could have been appropriately scored along with the entirety of his application. Mr. Chadwell's eligibility to retake the examination is further evidence that OPM's rule is procedural, having no substantive or merits-based effect on consideration of his application for initial appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our determination that OPM's one-year rule is not an employment practice is consistent with prior decisions which found an employment practice where the agency's rule at issue affected an applicant's eligibility for initial appointment to federal service. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, the petitioner was excluded from further consideration for initial appointment after his application had been passed over three times. We held that the passover rule constituted an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Lackhouse v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 734 F.2d 1471, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">cf. Maule v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 388, 392-94 (1989), a<span class="Italic">ff'd,</span> 892 F.2d 1050 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (noting that OPM's "timeliness-of-application" regulation does not concern the substantive "development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.") (citations omitted). Likewise, in <span class="Italic">Vesser,</span> the petitioner's name was removed from the list of eligible ALJ candidates resulting in his exclusion from consideration for initial appointment to a vacant ALJ position. OPM's rule that precluded annuitants from consideration for initial appointment to federal service was held to be an employment practice. <span class="Italic">See Vesser v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 29 F.3d 600, 603 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Meeker,</span> we held that a formula change in the scoring of ALJ examinations was an employment practice where the preliminary rescoring resulted in approximately eighty percent of applicants failing to achieve the minimum score necessary for certification and continued consideration for initial appointment as an ALJ. <span class="Italic">See Meeker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 319 F.3d 1368, 1370, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003). The scoring formula change clearly implicated the "measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to the decisions cited above, here, the application of OPM's one-year rule did not prevent Mr. Chadwell from concurrent or future consideration for initial appointment to open ALA positions.[3] The timing of when and whether Mr. Chadwell may modify or update a pending application, the effect of which is purely speculative, is a procedural matter and a reasonable exercise of the agency's discretion. In sum, the government is correct that OPM's one-year rule is a procedural rule and not an employment practice under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101. The one-year rule does not have a substantive or merits-based effect on Mr. Chadwell's eligibility for selection to an open ALA position. Rather, it is a reasonable limitation that allows OPM to provide a broader list of eligible candidates to agencies seeking referrals for open ALJ positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Our holding does not mean that every agency rule that excludes someone from initial appointment is necessarily an employment practice. We hold only that an agency rule is not an employment practice when the rule does not affect an applicant's consideration for initial appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An alleged glitch in an on-line computer application system administered by OPM relating to ALJ applications was deemed sufficient to constitute an employment practice in <span class="Italic">Zane v. OPM</span>, DC-300A-13-1480-I-1 (NP 7/30/2014), remanding the case for completion of discovery and adjudication:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An applicant for employment who believes that an employment practice applied to her by OPM violates a basic requirement in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a). The Board has jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.104(a) when two conditions are met: first, the appeal must concern an employment practice that OPM is involved in administering; and second, the appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. <span class="Italic">Meeker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 319 F.3d 1368, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Sauser v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 6 (2010). The term "employment practices," which includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments, is to be construed broadly. <span class="Italic">Bush v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 315 F.3d 1358, 1360-61 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Dowd v. United States</span>, 713 F.2d 720, 723-24 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Sauser</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6; 7; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserts that OPM's development of a computerized automated system to exclusively govern the ALJ examination process is an "employment practice." The appellant asserts further that the automated "employment practice" system had flaws that affected the processing of applications and consideration of candidates for the position, and that the flaws resulted in applicants not being informed of the steps in the process, or of a way to notify OPM of errors in the automated system or irregularities in the application process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the issue before us is whether OPM's online ALJ examination process, and the alleged electronic processing errors which may have occurred during the application of the examination, comes within the definition of "employment practice." Specifically, the appellant alleges that the manner in which OPM processed the examination materials are "employment practices" because those practices applied to the group of ALJ applicants as a whole. She asserts, however, that, without having been able to engage discovery, it is unclear to what extent these practices affect the ALJ examination process as a whole because only OPM has that information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the issue of whether the Board had jurisdiction over OPM's decision to suspend its ALJ examination process while it developed a new ALJ examination, even though Mr. Bush had already completed the first portion of the examination. The court found that "OPM's decision to develop a new ALJ examination comes squarely within the definition of 'employment practice' that includes the development and use of examinations." The court found further that OPM's suspension of processing any of the existing examinations until the new ALJ examination and standards had been adopted "was ancillary to and an integral part of its undertaking to develop a new examination." <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, 315 F.3d at 1360. Thus, the court found that, under the "broad and inclusive meaning of the term, OPM's suspension of the ALJ examination pending the adoption of a new examination was an 'employment practice,' that the Board has jurisdiction to review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1360-61.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, OPM developed an examination which required every applicant to apply online and further required the use of email for all communications between the applicants and OPM. Because the online application process was a requirement for all applicants, OPM's processing of the ALJ examination is ancillary to and an integral part of the development of the ALJ examination as a whole. Thus, under the "broad and inclusive meaning" of the term "employment practices" as the court held in <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, OPM's processing of the online ALJ examination appears to be an employment practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant appears to have identified a fatal flaw in the online ALJ examination process. In this instance, the appellant, despite her best efforts, could not even access the examination stage, even though she apparently qualified to do so. As a result, this glitch in the online application process prevented the appellant from demonstrating whether she met the basic requirements for the position as provided for under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103. By alleging that the online application process was flawed and as a result it violated one of the "basic requirements" for employment practices set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103, the appellant has raised a clear question of whether OPM's online ALJ examination process may constitute an employment practice over which the Board has jurisdiction. Thus, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the employment practice violated a basic requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.103.</p>
