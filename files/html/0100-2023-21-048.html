<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8337 (CSRS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 8453 (FERS):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A claim may be allowed under this subchapter only if application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who, at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. OPM</span>, 566 Fed. Appx. 947, 949 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mental incompetence for purposes of &#x00A7; 8453 is "a diminished ability to handle one's affairs in normal fashion." <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987). A claimant can establish mental incompetence even if the claimant has "some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs" during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1120. However, a person who suffers from mental disabilities is not necessarily mentally incompetent. <span class="Italic">See McLaughlin</span>, 353 F.3d at 1367.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stussy v. OPM</span>, 662 Fed. Appx. 972, 975 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) ("'This court's standard for mental incompetence is an inability to handle one's personal affairs because of either physical or mental disease or injury.' <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007)."..."As we noted in <span class="Italic">Rapp</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007)], 'mental disability and mental incompetence are not the same thing.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Creasy v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 44, 47 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 221 (2007), summarized the proof requirements when the lack of mental competence is urged as a basis for waiving the statutory deadline for filing a disability retirement application:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an applicant was mentally incompetent for purposes of this time limit, the Board requires medical evidence supporting subjective opinions of mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">Id.; Arizpe v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2001). Whether medical evidence on mental incompetence is sufficient to justify a waiver under &#x00A7; 8337(b) is judged by the same evidentiary requirements governing entitlement to disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 F. App'x 747 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The definition of mental incompetence "may be satisfied by one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs, and not needing to be committed"; the applicant need not show that he was a "raving lunatic continuously." <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The waiver provision based on mental incompetence was explained and applied, <span class="Italic">French v. OPM</span>, 30 MSPR 503, 504-07 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was removed from his position with the Social Security Administration on January 5, 1968. On April 2, 1984, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On May 9, 1984, the appellant was notified that his application was being dismissed due to its untimeliness. The notice further advised the appellant of what criteria warranted waiver of the timeliness requirement, and of his right to request reconsideration of the determination, if he believed he satisfied the criteria. The appellant then wrote two letters to the President of the United States, one of which was referred to OPM for a response. In its response, OPM informed appellant of the status of his application, the type of information necessary to support the claim, and of the time limit for requesting reconsideration. Because appellant failed to provide any documentation of the type which would be necessary to support a waiver of the time limit for applying for disability retirement, OPM again dismissed the application in a final decision letter dated July 23, 1985. OPM received no acknowledgment that the appellant received the reconsideration decision. On September 13, 1985, therefore, OPM again notified the appellant of the decision and of his appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board's St. Louis Regional Office, the presiding official reversed OPM's dismissal of the claim, finding that the timeliness requirement should be waived because appellant's failure to timely file was excused by his demonstrated mental incompetence, and that the application should be reviewed and a decision issued on the merits. The initial decision was based on the following: 1) appellant's testimony that he was mentally disabled at all times during the sixteen-year period between his separation from the Social Security Administration and his application for disability retirement; and 2) evidence presented by appellant consisting of personal notes kept by him during the time in question, and one psychiatric report dated August 25, 1981. The presiding official also found that OPM's rebuttal evidence could not be considered because it was not received until after the hearing had been held, and noted that, in any event, OPM did not appear at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM now petitions for review of that decision, contending the following: 1) that the presiding official erred in interpreting statute and regulation regarding timeliness of disability retirement applications; and 2) that the presiding official erred in not considering OPM's request to review and respond to appellant's hearing exhibits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basic statutory requirements for a timely filed disability retirement claim are set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a). That section provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or member is separated from the service or within one year thereafter. This time limit may be waived by the Office for an employee or member who at the date of separation from service or within one (1) year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within one year from the date of restoration of the employee or member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, neither the appellant nor anyone designated to act on his behalf provided any information to OPM to support a basis to waive the time limit for filing an application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, however, is not limited to review of the record before OPM, when adjudicating an appeal from an OPM disability retirement determination. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. OPM,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 413 (1981). We find, therefore, that the presiding official's consideration of appellant's testimony regarding his mental incompetence and of appellant's personal notes was proper. Nevertheless, we find that the presiding official erred in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of appellant as conclusive with regard to his mental capacity, and in finding that one psychiatric report dated August 25, 1982, diagnosing the appellant as suffering from a paranoid personality disorder, was sufficient to prove that the appellant was mentally incompetent for the period from 1968 to 1981.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical report of August 25, 1981, diagnosed appellant as having "a severe, chronic and fixed personality disorder which, <span class="Italic">at times,</span> manifested aspects of a paranoid schizophrenic disorder" (emphasis added). The report does not indicate when a deterioration in appellant's mental status occurred or how that deterioration affected the appellant's mental competency. <span class="Italic">See Paone v. Department of the Army,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 284, 288 (1982) (medical evidence which does not provide a time at which mental deterioration commenced or the degree to which the condition affected appellant's competence is insufficient to establish incompetency). Thus, we give the report no evidentiary weight with regard to appellant's mental competence in 1968, when he was removed from his position with the Social Security Administration, or at any time up until August 1981, when the report was written. Further, the report is irrelevant to any consideration of his competency from August 1981 to the time he filed for disability retirement with OPM in 1984.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that appellant's testimony concerning his claim of mental incompetence was "credible and persuasive." During the thirteen minute hearing, appellant was uncommunicative and referred the presiding official repeatedly to his personal diary. When questioned specifically regarding the reason for his inability to file a <span id="Page_4152"></span>timely application, the appellant stated twice that he did not know that he could file. Evidence in the record indicates, however, that in April 1966, appellant was aware of the disability retirement option. Although he stated that during the sixteen years in question he was unable to think for himself, he did not say that he was unable to do so at all times, and stated at present he was able to think for himself twenty percent of the time. Finally, we note that appellant's ability to successfully pursue a claim for Social Security benefits on his own behalf in 1981, tends to negate his claim that his untimely filing for disability retirement benefits in 1984, three years later, should be waived due to incompetence. We find, therefore, that based on the evidence of record and on the statutory provision governing the timeliness of applications for disability retirement, appellant's application was not timely filed and he has not established a basis for waiver of the time limit by showing that he was mentally incompetent when he was removed from his position in 1968 or at any pertinent time thereafter.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">For the Board to excuse a delayed disability annuity application based on a question of mental competence, medical proof from health care professionals is likely to be determinative, <span class="Italic">Crane v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 16, 18-20 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, while the appellant established that she was affected by Cushing's disease, the medical reports fail to establish mental incapacity such as is necessary to waive the filing time limit. The administrative judge relied on the appellant's and her husband's testimony to find mental incapacity. This is insufficient without a medical report finding mental incapacity either during the alleged period of incapacity, or after the diagnosis through a report finding mental incapacity over the prior four to seven years, or at least a medical probability that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the relevant period. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 665, 668 (1986); <span class="Italic">Paone v. Department of the Army</span>, 10 M.S.P.R. 284, 286-88. Although Cushing's syndrome may render some persons mentally incompetent, the record does not show that Cushing's syndrome renders all persons with the disease mentally incompetent. The appellant had notice that this information was necessary to her petition, since this was clearly the reason why OPM did not allow her application in its decision dated September 28, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in determining that the appellant was mentally incompetent, the administrative judge did not address the fact that, during this same period of time, the appellant was able to file employment applications and to be successfully employed in a variety of positions (consulting as an epidemiologist, substitute teaching, volunteer work, etc.), which required an ability to do more than rote manual tasks, and that she had written a paper on environmental toxins. These skills and accomplishments seem at odds with a determination of mental incapacity. While it is not inconceivable that the appellant was able to perform these jobs sufficiently and satisfactorily during the time she was allegedly mentally incapacitated, it is incredible. <span class="Italic">See Paone,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. at 287-89.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, OPM contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant was entitled to waiver of the time limit because her reason for the delay in filing her application in 1984 (beyond the 1981 delay) was not because of her mental incompetency, but, based on the testimony, because she did not have a diagnosis. We find that, even if the administrative judge had properly held that the appellant was rendered incapacitated by Cushing's disease, she erred in her ultimate determination that the appellant met her burden of showing that she was entitled to waiver because the administrative judge did not make a credible finding on when the appellant was restored to mental capacity. In October 1987, the appellant underwent an operation to take care of her medical problems which were causing Cushing's syndrome. The appellant claims that she was restored to mental capacity in February 1988, filed her application for disability retirement benefits in January 1989, and that therefore, she was within the one year time limit under the exception provided for mental incapacity. Yet, this was 15 months after the surgery. The appellant gives no reason to support a finding that she was restored to capacity in February 1988, and the administrative judge made no determination of when the appellant was mentally competent again. Furthermore, the medical reports do not indicate when she was restored to capacity. The appellant's failure to prove this issue, then, is fatal, because she has the burden of proof on the issue of mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.501(c); <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Body-Text">Amplifying upon <span class="Italic">French</span>, <span class="Italic">Bruce v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 617, 620-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-18, 2013 MSPB 51 (2013), recognized that mental incompetence can be established through medical testimony that offers a retrospective analysis as well as through medical evidence predating the onset of total disability, coupled with evidence from family members, as well as a lack of evidence demonstrating the employee's ability to perform normal life functions during the period of alleged incompetence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453, an application for disability retirement under FERS must be filed with an employee's employing agency before the employee separates from service or with the former employing agency or OPM within 1 year after the employee's separation. The 1-year time limit may be waived if the employee is mentally incompetent at the date of separation or within 1 year thereafter and if the application is filed with OPM within 1 year from the date the employee is restored to competency or is appointed a fiduciary, whichever is earlier. The issue in this case is whether the appellant showed by preponderant evidence that she was mentally incompetent during the period from July 19, 2004, to July 19, 2005. In determining whether an applicant was mentally incompetent for purposes of the time limit, the Board requires medical evidence supporting subjective opinions of mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">Arizpe v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2001). The definition of mental incompetence "may be satisfied by one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs, and not needing to be committed"; the applicant need not show that he was a "raving lunatic continuously." <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's guardian argues that the administrative judge failed to accord appropriate weight to the medical evidence, and failed to apply Board precedent to the facts of this case. The administrative judge specifically considered two reports from Dr. Rojcewicz, one from January 5, 2010, and one from May 21, 2011. Both were based on current examinations of the appellant and in both reports, after reviewing the appellant's personal medical history, Dr. Rojcewicz opined that she was unable to manage her affairs and therefore was mentally incompetent during the 1-year period in question because of severe symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. The administrative judge discounted Dr. Rojcewicz's reports, and his testimony which was in accord, finding it "inherently suspect" because he did not examine the appellant during the 1-year period in question and because, in the administrative judge's view, he based his opinion of the appellant's incompetency solely on his interview of her and her family in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that Dr. Rojcewicz did not examine the appellant in 2004 and 2005, the administrative judge acknowledged, but failed to consider, that he did see her on six occasions in 2003. Dr. Rojcewicz testified as to those sessions, and they are supported in the record by his medical notes. Based on his July 1, 2003 psychiatric evaluation, Dr. Rojcewicz diagnosed the appellant as suffering from Major Depressive Disorder, stating that she was "positive" for all nine items under Criterion A, as set forth under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Fourth Edition. These include depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, markedly diminished interest in almost all activities, fatigue and loss of energy, and diminished ability to think and concentrate nearly every day. Dr. Rojcewicz saw the appellant five more times in July and August 2003 for individual psychotherapy with evaluation and management, changed her antidepressant medication and then increased the dosage. He noted that she did not keep her September 2, 2003 appointment. Dr. Rojcewicz testified that the appellant did not contact him after that time and did not respond to his phone calls, and that she later told him that she had not taken the prescribed medication, and had also not done so in the past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record further reflects that, as of sometime earlier in 2003, the appellant's family did not know her whereabouts, and that their attempts to locate her were, for a period of time, unsuccessful. Eventually they learned that she was living in Luray, Virginia, having lost her home. In March 2003, her brother obtained a Power of Attorney in order to intervene and attempt to resolve matters that she had neglected, including foreclosure of her home, bankruptcy, and various lawsuits. He prevailed upon her to come to Washington to see Dr. Rojcewicz, which she did, but she did not follow through with treatment, as noted above, and she ultimately returned to Luray. In 2004, her family learned that <span id="Page_4153"></span>she was living in a women's shelter. According to her brother, she was "incoherent" and "inconsistent" when he visited her and was reluctant to seek treatment, either medical or psychological. Over the next years, her condition did not improve, prompting her brother to successfully seek and procure Social Security benefits for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2010, the appellant's brother persuaded her to return to Dr. Rojcewicz. He again diagnosed her as suffering from 296.23 Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Severe, without Psychotic Features, with symptoms more severe and chronic than before, as well as numerous medical conditions. Dr. Rojcewicz also saw the appellant on May 21, 2011, and found her psychiatric condition much the same. Dr. Rojcewicz testified that, based on the eight or nine times he had seen the appellant, the lack of improvement in her condition over the years, and the history provided by her family that she did not receive any treatment, he believed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that she was incompetent for at least the 1-year period from 2004 to 2005, and that she remained so for years thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's statement, a finding of mental incompetence need not always be based on medical evidence reflecting the results of an examination conducted of the appellant during the 1-year filing period. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Creasy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 44, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2007) (a psychiatrist's testimony, based on his examination of the appellant in 2004, that, "with probably a fairly good degree of medical certainty," his psychiatric symptoms had been present for 5-7 years, was sufficient to establish that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the filing period from January 3, 2002, to January 3, 2003); <span class="Italic">Hass v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (1999) (a psychiatrist's 1996 report diagnosing the appellant as suffering from Schizophrenia, Paranoid Type, was probative in finding her mentally incompetent during the filing period from January 16, 1987, to January 16, 1988); <span class="Italic">cf. McLaughlin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 353 F.3d 1363, 1368-69 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (the mere fact that psychiatrist's assessment was committed to paper outside the filing period is not probative of whether the applicant was mentally incompetent during the filing period).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other cases cited by the administrative judge are distinguishable and do not preclude a finding that Dr. Rojcewicz's medical opinion may be relied upon to support a finding that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the 1-year period in question. In <span class="Italic">Pilcher v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 317 (2004), the record included a statement prepared 5 years after the end of the filing period by the appellant's family physician in support of her late application for benefits. Although the statement indicated that the appellant was unable to handle her own affairs, the Board found it was entitled to little or no weight because it provided no support for its conclusion and was not accompanied by any supporting documentation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 24. The Board also considered a statement from a psychiatrist who assessed that the appellant was in no "psychic distress" and that she could manage any benefits in her own interest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 25. Considering testimony from the appellant's supervisor to the effect that, during the period in question, her ability to make decisions was compromised by her alcoholism, testimony from her aunt that she was "doing fine," and a one-sentence statement from a friend that the appellant was mentally incompetent, the Board, after reviewing all the evidence, upheld OPM's decision to disallow the appellant's application for disability retirement as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, however, Dr. Rojcewicz is a Board-certified psychiatrist, his well-explained findings are based on the criteria set forth in the DSM, and he has provided support for his conclusion that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the period in question. Moreover, there is no contrary medical evidence. And, there is significant detailed nonmedical evidence from the appellant's mother, and brother, during the time period in question that supports Dr. Rojcewicz's expert opinion regarding the appellant's incompetence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thieken v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 192, 194-95, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 11 F.3d 1074 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), the Board found that, notwithstanding the testimonies and statements of the appellant, her family, friends, and former co-workers that she had limited capacity to handle her affairs, the appellant had not substantiated her claim of mental incompetence so as to excuse her late-filed application for disability retirement. The Board found that none of the evidence she submitted to either OPM or the Board substantiated a mental problem and that instead, the evidence only chronicled her substantial medical problems. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 195. Here, however, Dr. Rojcewicz submitted considerable medical evidence as to the appellant's psychiatric condition and her mental incompetence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crane v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 16, 18 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table), the Board found that the administrative judge's reliance on the appellant's and her husband's testimony to find mental incompetence was insufficient without a medical report finding mental incapacity, either during the alleged period of incapacity or after the diagnosis through a report finding mental incapacity over the prior 4 to 7 years, or at least a medical probability that the appellant was mentally incompetent during the relevant period. The Board further found that, in determining that the appellant was mentally incompetent, the administrative judge did not address the fact that, during the same period of time, the appellant was able to file employment applications and to be successfully employed in a variety of positions with skills and accomplishments that the Board deemed "at odds" with a determination of mental incapacity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the record includes medical reports of the type the Board referenced in <span class="Italic">Crane</span> supporting a finding of mental incapacity. And, there is evidence that, during the period in question and thereafter, the appellant had given a Power of Attorney to her brother allowing him to manage her affairs. Further, there is evidence that she has not been employed after leaving her job with the Library of Congress in 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the above, we conclude, based on all the evidence presented, that the appellant has shown that she was mentally incompetent during the period from July 19, 2004, to July 19, 2005, and that her application was filed within 1 year from the date her brother was appointed as her guardian, and that therefore the statutory 1-year time limit for filing her application for disability retirement must be waived. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453.</p>

OPM</span>, AT-844E-12-0679-I-1 (NP 9/26/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, did not reach the issue of whether the appellant proved that he was disabled within the meaning of the retirement statutes because his application was untimely filed, and he did not show that the deadline should be waived. Under FERS, an application for a disability retirement annuity must be filed with OPM either before the employee's separation from service or within 1 year thereafter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. OPM may waive the time limit for an employee who, at the date of his separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent if the application is filed with OPM within 1 year of the date that the employee is restored to competency or a fiduciary is appointed for him, whichever is earlier. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant resigned as of July 6, 1998, his application for disability retirement was due by July 6, 1999, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. His application was dated January 12, 2010, but logged at OPM on March 11, 2011. Regardless of whether the appellant submitted the application in January 2010 or January 2011, it was untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish his entitlement to a waiver of the 1-year time limit for filing a disability retirement application, the appellant had to prove by preponderant evidence that he was mentally incompetent when he was separated from service or within 1 year thereafter, and that he filed his application within 1 year of the date he was restored to competency or within 1 year of the date of the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever occurred first. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge carefully considered and described the medical evidence, as well as statements made by several persons who knew the appellant during the period for which he claims mental incompetence. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant documented that he suffered from several debilitating or even disabling medical conditions at the time of and after his separation, and that he suffered from mental conditions affecting his ability to manage his day-to-day affairs. The administrative judge found that statements from the appellant's family and former colleagues documented his symptoms of depression and difficulty in functioning during 1997, when his father <span id="Page_4154"></span>died. Nevertheless, the administrative judge concluded that other witness statements and medical assessments, which are summarized in the initial decision, show that the appellant's condition improved after 2005. The appellant's submissions show that, after mid-2006, he collected evidence for his Social Security claim and for an application to discharge his student loan debt based on disability. The record further shows that the appellant sought information for his FERS disability retirement application as early as April 2009. The administrative judge concluded that the appellant's personal involvement in such evidence gathering demonstrates he was not incompetent to manage his own affairs as of mid-2006 and that any period of incompetence appears to have ended before January 2010. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 10 (1999). We thus find that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole and reasonably concluded that the appellant failed to file his disability retirement application within 1 year of the date he was restored to competency and that OPM properly dismissed his application as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bridges v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 290, 293 (1988), granted a waiver of the one-year application period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon our review of this testimony and the evidence in OPM's file, we find that the administrative judge's finding that the appellant "successfully" carries on his day-to-day activities because he lives alone and has no guardian or conservator is not supported by the evidence of record. Rather, the preponderance of the evidence shows that, although the appellant now lives alone, he could not manage to do so without the daily care provided by his sister and brother-in-law. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 810 F.2d 1118, 1120, <span class="Italic">reh'g &#x0026; reh'g en banc denied,</span> No. 86-1427 (July 15, 1987), the statutory provision for waiver of the time limit for filing because of mental incompetence does not require that the applicant be a "raving lunatic." The court held that the statute nay be satisfied by one who has some minimal capacity to manage his or her own affairs, and who does not need to be committed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A waiver was also granted in <span class="Italic">Pittman v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 297, 300-01 &#x00B6; 6-9 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An application for disability retirement under FERS must be filed with OPM before the employee is separated from service or within 1 year thereafter. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. This time limit will be waived if the employee "at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent, [and] if the application is filed with [OPM] within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee...to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant personally filed his application for disability retirement after the 1-year filing period, which expired on March 21, 2003. Thus, the question before us is whether the appellant was "mentally incompetent" on March 21, 2002, or within 1 year thereafter, and if so, whether he was restored to competence before October 28, 2002, i.e., 1 year prior to the filing of his disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an applicant was mentally incompetent for purposes of the time limit for filing a disability retirement application, the Board requires medical evidence supporting subjective opinions of medical incompetence. <span class="Italic">Arizpe v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 9 (2001). A medical provider's conclusion that an individual is mentally incompetent is persuasive only if the medical provider explains how a mental illness renders the individual incompetent. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 46, &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 48 Fed. Appx. 747 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The definition of mental incompetence "may be satisfied by one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs, and not needing to be committed. The claimant is not required to have been a raving lunatic...." <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, we find that the appellant's medical evidence is sufficient to establish that he was mentally incapacitated during the year following his separation from federal service, and within the year preceding his application. In his December 17, 2003 letter, Dr. Shain states that his diagnosis of PTSD and major depression was based on "evaluations and observations as with similar cases," and that no psychological testing was indicated, as the appellant had "presented with clear and significant clinical symptoms. The February 24, 2004 letter, signed by Dr. Shain and Mr. Ishii, discusses in further detail the appellant's symptoms, including "chronic apathy, sense of foreshortened future and sense of profound futility," as well as "impaired communication skills due to difficulties with attention span, and impairment with short/long term memory," and concludes that the appellant is "grossly impaired socially with limited functional abilities at this time." In his October 15, 2004 letter, Dr. Shain again certifies that the appellant has been under his care since April 2000, and further states that the appellant is "mentally incompetent in occupational and social functioning." In his October 19, 2004 letter, Mr. Ishii relates that the appellant has suffered an exacerbation of his PTSD symptoms since his resignation, "especially impairment of short and long term memory, depressed helplessness and paranoid avoidance of human contact, both social and official." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Mr. Ishii specifically states that the appellant was "mentally incompetent" during the year following his resignation, as his symptoms "made it impossible for him to engage in appropriate follow through of activities that would have been to [sic] his best interest."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that at the time of his September 17, 2001 discharge from the Roseburg VA Hospital, as well as his second discharge on March 5, 2002, the appellant was deemed "capable of managing any VA funds due to him and making decisions related to his health care. He was also deemed "competent" at the time of his December 22, 2003 discharge. However, these observations are consistent with a chronic mental illness characterized by "brief remissions."<span class="Italic"></span> Moreover, it is not strictly relevant whether the appellant was competent on dates occurring before his resignation, or after the filing of his application. Because the appellant has established that he was mentally incapacitated during the filing period, and within a year of the actual filing date, the time limit must be waived. <span class="Italic">See Hass v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 15 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saroli v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 249, 252-53 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (granting waiver of one-year limit: "Where, as here, a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature permanent or progressive in severity, it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Pyles v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 415 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Eddy v.

<p class="Body-Text">An individual may be found mentally incompetent by the Board, sufficient to warrant a delayed disability retirement application, even though that person can handle some personal affairs, <span class="Italic">Hass v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 110, 115-16 &#x00B6; 12-14 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge acknowledged the appellant's disabling mental condition, but nevertheless found that she was not mentally incompetent within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). She explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;[The appellant] gave reasoned explanations for some of the noted behavior, i.e., she did not open bills because she knew she couldn't pay them, and she was late in making house payments because she knew she had to save the money from welfare checks for three months and that her house wouldn't go into foreclosure before three months; and (2) she took care to arrange for other persons to handle the important affairs she felt unable to handle alone, such as challenging the denials of unemployment insurance and of OWCP benefits, and applying for and obtaining benefits under the Aid for Families with Dependent children program. It follows therefore, that she would have sought and obtained whatever assistance she may have needed to help her apply to OPM for disability retirement benefits during the time period in question, had she been aware of the availability of that benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the question of the appellant's ability to manage her personal affairs and to pursue various legal claims, the appellant and her witnesses testified without rebuttal that she was not capable of satisfactorily managing her personal affairs and required their substantial assistance and that she pursued her legal claims only with their help and with the help of attorneys and other representatives. Under these circumstances, we find that the fact that she managed her personal affairs without a legal guardian or that she pursued legal claims does not demonstrate that she herself had more than a minimal capacity to manage her own affairs. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 MSPR 174 (1999) (that the appellant pursued claims in other venues during the relevant time period did not necessarily overcome the medical evidence tending to show that his mental illness impaired his ability to meet the time limit for filing the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 MSPR 642 (1999), the Board found that the appellant's pursuit of claims in other venues during the relevant time period constituted significant circumstantial evidence that he was competent to manage his own affairs, for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). The Board did not specify whether Smith pursued his other claims <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, but it appears likely that he did since he filed the Board appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. We find that the distinguishing factor here is that the appellant did not pursue any of her other legal claims <span class="Italic">pro se</span> during the relevant time period.</p>

Cir. 2023 NP) ("Ms. Webb's claims that she was ‘diagnosed with a medical condition' and is ‘disable[d],' are not equivalent to a claim that she was ‘mentally incompetent,' 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453. See McLaughlin, 353 F.3d at 1367 (‘[D]isability and mental incompetence for the purposes of waiving the one-year filing deadline examine different facts.

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4155"></span>Participation in litigated matters during a period of alleged mental incompetence may be some evidence tending to refute the asserted incompetence as <span class="Italic">Pilcher v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM asserts that the fact that the appellant executed this court document provides support for its finding that the appellant was competent.
