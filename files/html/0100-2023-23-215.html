<p class="Body-Text">The decisions of the Federal Circuit criticizing "clean paper" settlements were discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-214.html#sec16-212">Agreement to Provide Affirmative, Neutral, or Controlled Reference</a>." Those decisions include <span class="Italic">Godwin v. DOD</span>, 228 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Pagan v. VA</span>, 170 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999); and <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628 (Fed. Cir. 1995). A good summary of the law of clean paper is in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dept. of Army</span>, 116 MSPR 160, 2011 MSPB 45 (2011). Notwithstanding judicial cautionary words, those settlement provisions remain popular. As a result, litigation over breach of the agreements remains frequent. The implications of these agreements must be carefully considered. Readers should review <span class="Italic">Clean Record Settlement Agreements and the Law</span> (MSPB Office of Policy and Evaluation 2013). <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Clean_Record_Settlement_Agreements_and_the_Law_938820.pdf">https://www.mspb.gov/studies/studies/Clean_Record_Settlement_Agreements_and_the_Law_938820.pdf.</a> The Board's 2013 study states that about two-thirds of Board cases are settled, and that of those settled half that many include a clean record provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At least through the end of 2016, with the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, discussed below, calling for coding of personnel records when an individual resigns while under investigation, clean paper settlements have been routine. An employee may, generally with other provisions concerning employment references, agree with an agency as a settlement condition that his record will be "clean," that is, his record (however defined in the settlement agreement) will contain no adverse information or references that could be interpreted as or traced to adverse information (however defined). If an agency enters into a "clean paper" settlement, its references concerning the employee must be consistent with the intent of the agreement. The object of a clean paper agreement is to ensure that anyone reviewing the appellant's personnel file would be unaware of the agency's removal action. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 635, 642 &#x00B6; 12 (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the critique of the settlement reached in <span class="Italic">Holmes v. VA</span>, 58 F.3d 628, 630-33 (Fed. Cir. 1995), an agency that subscribes to the settlement provision must conform its actions to ensure that references and comments concerning the appellant are consistent with the spirit and letter of the settlement. The Federal Circuit held, with some reluctance, in <span class="Italic">Pagan v. VA</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1369-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999), that a "clean record" settlement requires the agency to provide information to prospective employers that is consistent with a clean record, i.e., to cast references in a positive tone and to avoid statements or omissions in references that would key a future employer to a past problem with the current employer. The agency that agrees to a "clean record" settlement must do more than simply ensure the absence of damaging paperwork in personnel files:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From February 12, 1989 until November 27, 1995, Mr. Pagan worked at the Puerto Rico National Cemetery ("PRNC") as a Program Support Assistant for Office Automation. Mr. Pagan received "fully successful" evaluations on his annual reviews from 1989 to April 1992. From April 1992 through March 1995, Mr. Pagan achieved "highly successful" evaluations and cash awards for his high level of performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite Mr. Pagan's good reviews, the PRNC in 1995 notified Mr. Pagan of his proposed removal and placed him on administrative leave status. The notice of proposed removal listed fourteen charges against Mr. Pagan, including: improperly paying various PRNC expenses from imprest funds, recommending his future wife for a PRNC job without disclosing the relationship, refusing to take orders from his direct supervisor, acting disrespectfully toward his direct supervisor, failing to follow sick leave procedures, and neglecting to fill out the proper forms and providing payment for an office plumbing job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently the PRNC Director, Jorge L. Lopez, sustained the charges against Mr. Pagan. Mr. Lopez considered Mr. Pagan's prior work record, but concluded that removal was reasonable and appropriate in light of the seriousness of the sustained charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pagan appealed his removal to the Board. The assigned Administrative Judge ("AJ") held a hearing during which the AJ presided over negotiations and helped the parties reach a settlement agreement. The AJ wrote the agreement after both parties expressed their interests. In particular, Mr. Pagan told the AJ that he had to have a clean record because he was in the process of interviewing for a U.S. Postal Service ("USPS") job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant portions of the settlement agreement provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The appellant agrees not to apply to the Puerto Rico National Cemetery (PRNC) for the next 5 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;The appellant will receive a clean record. All charges and actions will be removed from the appellant's personnel file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;The terms of the agreement will remain confidential between the parties. The appellant agrees not to disclose the terms to any <span id="Page_5103"></span>other individual or agency employee. The agency agrees not to disclose the terms to any prospective employer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement called for Mr. Pagan's resignation from the PRNC for personal reasons, and the withdrawal of his Board appeal. In exchange, the PRNC provided Mr. Pagan with back pay from December 1995 to April 1996, and $8000 in settlement fees. The agreement specifically stated that it was entered into voluntarily, and the Board retained jurisdiction over the agreement for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While his appeal was pending and negotiations were on-going, Mr. Pagan applied for a job with the USPS. In his application, Mr. Pagan disclosed his removal and the pending appeal. Following the settlement agreement ending his Board appeal, Mr. Pagan explained during an April 3, 1996 interview with the USPS that the Board hearing had concluded with a confidential settlement agreement. In response to a USPS request for clarification, Mr. Pagan referred to the confidential nature of the agreement, then later submitted a standard agency form showing his voluntary resignation effective April 2, 1996. After the interview, the USPS Human Resources Office notified Mr. Pagan that they were expecting some documents from the PRNC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his response to a USPS request to the DVA for more information regarding Mr. Pagan, PRNC Director Lopez did not answer "yes" or "no" to the question: "Would you rehire this individual?" Instead, Mr. Lopez placed an asterisk next to the question and answered: "Due to circumstances beyond my control no comment [sic] can be made at this time." Another question asked Mr. Lopez to rate Mr. Pagan's attendance, work performance, behavior, and attitude using an excellent to unsatisfactory scale. Mr. Lopez crossed out the whole scale without rating Mr. Pagan in any of the above categories. Shortly thereafter, the USPS informed Mr. Pagan that there were no positions available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pagan filed a motion for enforcement of his settlement agreement with the Board on December 19, 1996. He alleged that the DVA had violated the terms of the agreement by Mr. Lopez's response to the USPS employment questionnaire, and by Mr. Lopez's alleged verbal disclosure of the settlement agreement terms to PRNC individuals and a USPS employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ who had written the settlement agreement also heard Mr. Pagan's enforcement motion. The AJ found that Mr. Pagan failed to sustain his burden that the agency did not comply with the terms of the agreement. The AJ found that the settlement agreement is silent as to what kind of reference or recommendation would be given upon request, but that Mr. Lopez's questionnaire answers did not violate the agreement because his response did not divulge any of the terms of the agreement. Furthermore, the AJ determined that Mr. Lopez's alleged violation of the agreement through oral statements was unsupported by the record. Consequently, the AJ denied Mr. Pagan's request for enforcement. The AJ's initial decision became the final decision of the Board on June 4, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Pagan is now before this court appealing the denial of his request for enforcement by the Board. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1295 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Mr. Pagan alleges that the DVA violated the terms of his settlement agreement through Mr. Lopez's written response to the USPS questionnaire, and through Mr. Lopez's verbal disclosure of the settlement terms to various individuals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of a settlement agreement is an issue of law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mays v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The settlement agreement is a contract, of course, and its interpretation is a matter of law."); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). We independently review the Board's legal determinations for correctness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1993). To the extent the settlement agreement is clearly stated and understood by the parties, it is enforced according to its terms. If any ambiguity is found, our role is to implement the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was made. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Pagan agreed to voluntarily resign in exchange for "a clean record," with all charges and actions removed from his personnel file. Mr. Pagan told the AJ in particular that a "clean record" was necessary because he was in the midst of applying for a USPS position. Clearly, Mr. Pagan's intent was to eliminate any information in his record about his adverse removal from the PRNC so it would not affect his chances of future employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We read "clean record" in the context of the agreement to mean that Mr. Pagan's personnel record was to be restored to its former state--with his "fully successful" and "highly successful" ratings uncontroverted by any evidence of charges or the related removal action. Neither the evidence nor the arguments offered by the DVA persuade us that the parties intended and agreed to any alternative meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King</span>, 130 F.3d at 1033 ("[W]ords used by the parties to express their agreement are given their ordinary meaning, unless it is established that the parties mutually intended and agreed to some alternative meaning." (citing <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In exchange for Mr. Pagan's resignation, the DVA agreed to remove all charges and actions from his personnel record and to refrain from disclosing the terms of the confidential agreement. Though quite specific on those points, the agreement did not spell out the nature of the reference the DVA was to provide upon request from Mr. Pagan's potential employers. Thus, though the purpose of the settlement agreement was clear, exactly how to respond to the question: "Would you rehire this individual?" was less so. On the basis of a "clean record" in Mr. Pagan's personnel file, Mr. Lopez could check "yes," but on the basis of the facts as he knew them, to be honest he should check "no."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The follow-up question did not pose the same dilemma. It requested that Mr. Pagan be rated in four employee quality categories on a scale from unsatisfactory to excellent. Given the agreement, Mr. Lopez should have rated Mr. Pagan on his attendance, work performance, behavior, and attitude based on a personnel file with "[a]ll charges and actions...removed," rather than by crossing out the rankings for the four categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency did not promise to provide a favorable reference, or even any reference at all, it was required to act, in matters relating to Mr. Pagan, as if he had a "clean record." The act of crossing out the portion of the USPS questionnaire asking that Mr. Pagan be ranked according to his attendance, work performance, behavior, and attitude, and then returning the form in that condition would have strongly suggested to any recipient of the form that Mr. Pagan did not have a "clean record" with the DVA. Thus, Mr. Lopez's response to the USPS questionnaire constituted a breach of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Settlement agreements may serve a useful purpose in terminating disputes without the necessity for further administrative or judicial proceedings. The incorporation into such agreements of a "clean record" requirement has proven to be a source of problems--problems that necessitate the very administrative or judicial proceedings sought to be avoided. As a result, this court has expressed its concern with agency settlement agreements that allow an unsatisfactory employee to resign in exchange for a personnel record clear of all charges and adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("It may well be that it is virtually impossible for agencies to ensure that settlement agreements such as this...can be performed to the letter.... Perhaps as a matter of sound governmental administration such agency agreements should be prohibited."). Indeed, such agreements invite trouble. The employee expects, perhaps unrealistically, that with a "clean record" potential employers will be unable to find out about adverse actions taken by the former employer. The former employer, when asked, must either outright lie, or attempt some artful evasion which, because other employers now recognize what these agencies do, in fact fools no one. This case is simply another example of how unsatisfactory these agreements may turn out to be.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although reasonable settlement of employment disputes is commendable, when the agency is required to give no information or an agreed-upon "neutral" reference, "the practice of one government agency palming off an unacceptable employee on another government agency by withholding material evidence concerning the employee's conduct hardly serves the public interest." <span class="Italic">Holmes v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 F.3d 628, 634 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Plager, J., concurring) (commenting in the context of a settlement agreement requiring the agency to reply to potential employers with a "neutral" reference).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, these agreements are often little more than a trap for an uninformed or unwary employee. The agency is in a better position to know and appreciate the potential problems such agreements present, both for the employee and for the employer; at a minimum the agency has the responsibility to ensure that the employee understands the problems, and that the agreement adequately addresses them. The Board has a difficult job sorting through some of these enforcement agreements, particularly those that are not well-drafted, but so long as agencies continue to sweep their personnel problems under a rug with holes in it, it is the Board's job to see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above reasons, we vacate the Board's denial of Mr. Pagan's request for enforcement of his settlement agreement with the DVA. We remand the case to allow the Board to fashion an appropriate remedy for Mr. Pagan.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Extending the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Pagan</span> and kindred cases, the Board set aside a "clean paper" settlement on a theory of mutual mistake or, alternatively and possibly lack of good faith bargaining, in <span class="Italic">Vance v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/VANCE_REGINALD_E_DC_0752_08_0733_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_538577.pdf">114 MSPR 679</a>, 683-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-17, 2010 MSPB 201 (2010), when, before the settlement but apparently without knowledge of the parties negotiating the agreement, <span id="Page_5104"></span>the agency inspector general posted on its website a report referencing the appellant's removal and charges against him:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have construed a settlement agreement that, like here, calls for rescission of a removal and issuance of a SF-50 showing resignation, to constitute a promise by the agency to "eras[e] 'removal' and all reasons for such a removal from [the employee's] professional record with the agency"--in other words, provide the employee with a "clean record." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Principe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1374, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). Thus, the Board has found that such a "clean record" settlement agreement not only required the expungement of removal-related documents from the employee's personnel file but also "prohibited the agency from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties." <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999)); <span class="Italic">see also Allen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 8 (2009) <span class="Italic">Torres</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. The Board's key concern in such cases is to "see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Torres</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 11 (citing <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1372).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this matter, it is obvious that the essence of the parties' November 17, 2008 settlement agreement was the appellant's agreement to resign his position in exchange for a clean record as defined above. The administrative judge found that the agency had appropriately purged the appellant's Official Personnel File "of all removal-related documents in compliance with the settlement agreement." We agree with the administrative judge that the declaration the agency filed in response to the appellant's petition for enforcement established that the agency purged the appellant's Official Personnel File. This alone, however, is not sufficient to provide an employee with a clean record. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Principe</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 9 (clean record settlement agreement also prohibited the agency from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties). First of all, the text of the agreement requires that: "In communications concerning Appellant's employment with the Agency, the Agency will maintain that Appellant resigned voluntarily, effective July 25, 2008, and provide a neutral reference." Similarly, the Board has held that a "clean record" settlement like the one involved here requires that "the agency's communications with third parties reflect what the replacement SF-50 shows, i.e., that [the employee] resigned, and that it not disclose the circumstances of the removal." <span class="Italic">Torres</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 12. Thus, under the parties' settlement agreement, the agency "was required to act, in matters relating to the appellant, as if he had a 'clean record.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1371). However, as noted above, at the time that the parties entered into the settlement agreement at issue, the agency's Office of Inspector General had already published the details of the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Inspector General Act requires the Inspector General of each covered agency to furnish the head of that agency with semiannual reports of its activities, and that individual must transmit the report to Congress. 5 U.S.C. Appendix 3, &#x00A7; 5. Pursuant to that authority, the agency's Inspector General released a Semiannual Report to Congress on October 30, 2008. That report included the details of the appellant's removal. However, the Inspector General's report predated the parties' November 17, 2008 settlement agreement. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the publication of the Inspector General's semiannual report did not violate the parties' subsequently executed settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, regardless of whether the Inspector General was required by law to publish the information in question, once the Office of the Inspector General decided to publish it in its semiannual report, the agency could not compel the Inspector General to stop its publication or to demand that it be corrected to reflect what really happened. The report of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the Inspector General Act notes that the head of the agency "may not generally prevent the [Inspector General's] report from going to Congress or alter or delete the report." <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-1071, 1978 USCCAN 2677. Further, to the extent that the appellant argues that the agency's continued publication of the Inspector General's report on the internet following the execution of the settlement agreement is a continuing breach of the settlement agreement, the same point would apply. The independence of the Office of the Inspector General with regard to the statutory requirement to report its activities to Congress precludes the head of the agency from changing the content of that report. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Although we see no reason why the Inspector General would continue to publicly report incorrect private information about the appellant's employment with the agency, given the independence accorded to Inspector Generals, we see no authority for the Board or the agency to order that the information either be corrected or excised from the report. This is not to say that the agency officials responsible for negotiating the settlement agreement could not have asked the Inspector General to correct the report to reflect that the appellant was not removed from his position. However, the record does not indicate that they did so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The settlement agreement must be set aside.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-settled that a settlement agreement is a contract between the parties that may be set aside or voided only on the basis of certain limited grounds, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, fraud or a mutual mistake of material fact under which both parties acted. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 7 (2002). A mutual mistake of fact is a shared, mistaken belief of the parties regarding a material assumption of fact underlying their agreement. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Army</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 90, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2008); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 417, 421 (1994), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 47 F.3d 1184 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, implicit in any contract is the requirement that the parties fulfill their respective obligations in good faith, and acting in bad faith may constitute breach. <span class="Italic">Adams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 6, 11 (1996); <span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 314, 323 (1995). The Board has defined "bad faith" as "the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity." <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described above, the parties' settlement agreement was premised on the basic assumption that, by taking the steps outlined in the agreement, the appellant would have a clean employment record. The Inspector General's semiannual report, which included information about the appellant's removal, made that goal unachievable, unless the report was either altered or redacted. Thus, the parties may have executed their settlement agreement under a mutual mistake of fact, i.e., that it was possible at that time the parties executed their agreement to give the appellant a clean employment record. <span class="Italic">Cf. Woodjones v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (a shared misunderstanding about whether a decision on that appellant's disability retirement application had been made, and the time to challenge it had passed, would be a mutual mistake of fact).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if the individuals who negotiated the agreement on behalf of the agency knew or had reason to know that the Inspector General would publish, or already had published, the details of the appellant's removal, then, at the very least, the agency would have negotiated the agreement in bad faith, keeping to itself the knowledge that the appellant could never have the benefit of the bargain he made. <span class="Italic">See Adams</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 11-12 (agency may have acted in bad faith if it knew or had reason to know at the time it entered into settlement that the light-duty assignment it offered was not viable). However, there is nothing in the record to indicate whether, at the time the parties executed their settlement agreement, either one knew or had reason to know that the Inspector General had already published the details of the appellant's removal, putting the goal of their agreement out of reach, absent some action by the Inspector General's office to either rescind or redact its report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, under either alternative, mutual mistake or bad faith on the part of the agency in negotiating the settlement agreement, the settlement agreement must be set aside. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Farrell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6; 8 (2000) ("A settlement agreement must be set aside if it is tainted with invalidity either by fraud practiced upon a party or by a mutual mistake under which both parties acted."). Ordinarily, a finding that a settlement agreement must be set aside results in the reinstatement of the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Gullette v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 569, 577 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 415, 420 (1994)). However, where a settlement agreement must be set aside because of the failure of an essential part of that agreement, but the appellant has obtained other benefits pursuant to that agreement, the Board has found it appropriate to offer the appellant a choice between reinstating his appeal or accepting the settlement agreement as is. <span class="Italic">See Gullette</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 576-77.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, remand is necessary. Upon remand, the administrative judge shall inquire whether the appellant wishes to reinstate his removal appeal or accept the parties' settlement agreement notwithstanding the Inspector General's publication of the details of his rescinded removal. Alternatively, the parties may choose to negotiate a new settlement agreement. The administrative judge shall then issue a new initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ubiquitous nature of federal records suggests that the broader the "clean record" agreement, the more likely its inadvertent violation by the agency. The Board enforces or rescinds these agreements as necessary to remedy material violations. If an agency agrees to expunge information from the employee's official personnel file and "any other employment records," the agency may be held to its agreement and the extent of records that may be encompassed can be quite broad. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. USDA</span>, <span class="blue">99 MSPR 161</span>, 168 &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (payroll records). An agency may settle by agreeing to withdraw determinations or recommendations affecting employment benefits. <span class="Italic">Artis v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 412, 416 &#x00B6; 9 (2000), involved an agreement that the agency not oppose the appellant's OWCP claim. In compliance proceedings the agency was required to withdraw a letter that opposed the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Artis v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 256, <span id="Page_5105"></span>259 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (enforcement proceeding resulting in agency's withdrawal of challenge to OWCP claim); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Abram v.

<p class="Body-Text">Report 114-454 (March 16, 2016), of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform explains the legislative purpose of the provisions incorporated into the appropriations statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Currently, a federal employee who is under investigation for misconduct or performance issues may resign from employment in the midst of an investigation and may largely escape formal discipline or accountability (including any notation of such issues in his or her official personnel file), should the investigation result in an adverse finding against the separated employee. Individuals who resign in such circumstances could then seek employment with another federal agency, which would not necessarily have knowledge of the adverse finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While circumstances such as these are rare, it is important to close loopholes that allow individuals to take advantage of the federal government's highly structured investigatory and disciplinary process to escape responsibility for their actions. To correct this problem, H.R. 4360 requires that a notation be made in an employee's official personnel file if the employee resigns while under investigation and the investigation subsequently results in an adverse finding against the employee. This will help ensure that other agencies will be aware of the finding should the employee apply for federal employment at a later time. Importantly, H.R. 4360 provides separated employees the opportunity to respond to an investigation's findings before the agency head makes a final determination on the adverse finding. Further, the bill also affords appeal rights to a separated employee to guard against any unfair or inaccurate notation in the former employee's personnel file.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 5 of Executive Order (EO) 13839</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5 of Executive Order 13839 of May 25, 2018, Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent With Merit System Principles, provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sec. 5. Ensuring Integrity of Personnel Files. Agencies shall not agree to erase, remove, alter, or withhold from another agency any information about a civilian employee's performance or conduct in that employee's official personnel records, including an employee's Official Personnel Folder and Employee Performance File, as part of, or as a condition to, resolving a formal or informal complaint by the employee or settling an administrative challenge to an adverse personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5 of EO 13839 is intended to promote the highest standards of integrity and accountability in the federal workforce by requiring agencies to maintain accurate personnel records and to not alter the information contained in those records in connection with a formal or informal complaint or adverse personnel action. It is further intended to ensure that those records are preserved so that agencies can make appropriate and informed decisions regarding an employee's qualification, fitness, and suitability as applicable to future employment. It is for this reason that agencies are directed not to remove or otherwise modify information contained in a personnel file as a means of resolving an employee-initiated action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Application of Section 5 of EO 13839</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following guidance is intended to further clarify the application of Section 5 of EO 13839:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Corrective Action Based on Discovery of Agency Error</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5 requirements should not be construed to prevent agencies from taking corrective action should it come to light, including during or after the issuance of an adverse personnel action, that the information contained in a personnel record is not accurate or records an action taken by the agency illegally or in error. In such cases, an agency would have the authority, unilaterally or by agreement, to modify an employee's personnel file to remove inaccurate information or the record of an erroneous or illegal action. An agency may take such action even if an appeal/complaint has been filed relating to the information that the agency determines to be inaccurate or to reflect an action taken illegally or in error. In all events, however, the agency must ensure that it removes only information that the agency itself has determined to be inaccurate or to reflect an action taken illegally or in error. And an agency should report any agreements relating to the removal of such information as part of its annual report to the OPM Director required by Section 6 of EO 13839. Documents subject to withdrawal or modification could include, for example, an SF-50 issuing a disciplinary or performance-based action, a decision memorandum accompanying such action, or an employee performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Corrective Action Based on Discovery of Material Information Prior to Final Agency Action</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When persuasive evidence comes to light prior to the issuance of a final agency decision on an adverse personnel action casting doubt on the validity of the action or the ability of the agency to sustain the action in litigation, an agency may decide to cancel or vacate the proposed action. Additional information may come to light at any stage of the process prior to final agency decision including during an employee response period. To the extent an employee's personnel file or other agency records contain a proposed action that is subsequently cancelled, an agency would have the authority to remove that action from the employee's personnel file or other agency files. Section 5's requirements would, however, continue to apply to any accurate information about the employee's conduct leading up to that proposed action or separation from federal service.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Returning to the pre-Executive Order days, <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997), represents an effort by the Federal Circuit to require the Board to require agencies to abide by their settlement agreements to ensure clean records for employees--even when the agency must expunge or modify records outside the OPF and outside the immediate possession of the agency. In <span class="Italic">King</span> the appellant's agreement called for all references to her discipline to be expunged from her OPF. It was discovered that, although the Navy's personnel records were cleansed, those of the Office of Personnel Management and Defense Finance and Accounting Service contained references to the underlying removal action. Those references violated the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After Petitioner appealed to the Board, she and the Navy entered into a settlement agreement. The Navy agreed to "cancel the removal action of the appellant...and remove all reference to the removal action from her Official Personnel File." The Navy agreed to treat her time lost due to illness as authorized leave, to change its records accordingly, and to pay her reasonable attorney fees up to $1200. Petitioner agreed to submit and the Navy agreed to process her voluntary resignation. The agreement was entered into the appeal record before the Board, and the appeal was dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Through a Freedom of Information Act inquiry, Petitioner learned that records with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) contain references to the removal action. Petitioner brought an action to enforce the settlement agreement. The Board accepted the government's position that the reference in the settlement agreement to Petitioner's "official personnel file" means only the personnel file in the possession of the Navy, and does not include the personnel files of OPM and DFAS. Thus the Board denied the Petition for Enforcement. This appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interpretation of a settlement agreement is an issue of law. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1059 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The settlement agreement is a contract, of course, and its interpretation is a matter of law."); <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). We review the Board's determinations of law for correctness, without deference to the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The construction of [the disputed] term in the agreement is a question of law that this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting a written agreement, we first ascertain whether the written understanding is clearly stated and was clearly understood by the parties. If ambiguity is found, or if ambiguity has arisen during performance of the agreement, the judicial role is to implement the intent of the parties at the time the agreement was made. In so doing the words used by the parties to express their agreement are given their ordinary meaning, unless it is established that the parties mutually intended and agreed to some alternative meaning<span class="Italic">. Perry</span>, 992 F.2d at 1579; <span class="Italic">Hol-Gar Mfg. Corp. v. United States</span>, [ ] 351 F.2d 972, 976 (Ct. Cl. 1965). The paramount focus is the intention of the parties at the time of contracting; that intention controls in any subsequent dispute. <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560 ("Our task [in construing the settlement agreement] is to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted, as evidenced by the contract itself.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee voluntarily resigns in exchange for purging of the records that show the prior adverse action, the employee's goal, to which the agency has agreed, is to eliminate this information as it may affect future employment with the government or elsewhere. As was explained in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997), "[t]he agency's agreement to deny to potential future employers, including other agencies of the United States Government, the truth about Thomas's performance at HUD was the major benefit that Thomas received in exchange for agreeing to resign from his position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By correcting only those files in the hands of the Navy, and by retaining references in official government personnel files to the action that was subsequently revoked, Petitioner was denied the benefit of her agreement. Accepting that the Navy's agreement was made in good faith, continuance of that good faith now requires perfecting that which was flawed. <span class="Italic">See McCall v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988) ("We think it is implicit in the agreement here that the agency must abide by it in good faith.") Thus the Board erred in dismissing the petition for enforcement, for the Navy did not fulfill its agreed obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy relies on <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 677, 679-80 (1996), and <span class="Italic">Fuller v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 47 MSPR 211, 216, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 945 F.2d 417 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Neither case supports the Board's ruling. In <span class="Italic">Warren</span> the settlement agreement provided specifically for expungement of information about a removal action and the denial of a within-grade pay increase, but did not provide for expungement of information about a suspension; when Warren later attempted to have <span id="Page_5107"></span>the information about the suspension expunged, the Board sustained the agency's refusal. In <span class="Italic">Fuller</span> the alleged breach of the settlement agreement was the verbal communication of information that had been expunged from the personnel records; there was no issue of failure to expunge the records. Here, however, the information Petitioner seeks to have expunged is no more than what the government agreed to.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears to be undisputed that the mutual intent was to purge the personnel records that are officially kept and thus might be available to a future employer; no other reasonable meaning has been proposed. The settlement agreement applies to official personnel files where those files exist. It is highly unlikely that the parties bargained for the purging of only local personnel records, while the main personnel files at the Office of Personnel Management, as well as official files at DFAS, retain the undesired information. Although the government also argues that the Navy has no control over OPM or DFAS, and thus can not be held to have agreed that these agencies would expunge their files, there is no assertion that OPM and DFAS have refused to comply with the settlement agreement. We assume that they have not so refused, and thus do not reach the issue of the Navy's, or the Board's, authority to enter into and to enforce this settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision denying Petitioner's enforcement petition is reversed. The case is remanded for further procedures consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, <span class="Italic">King</span> returned to the Federal Circuit. In the second appeal, the court determined that the Board correctly found the alleged breach to be immaterial, because it did not affect the appellant's ability to secure employment, <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3342):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. King's principal argument is that the Navy's breach of the settlement agreement was material and that the Board should have ordered the agreement rescinded. She argues that the Navy's failure to completely purge her records of references to her removal was a breach that could not be cured. As the Board found, however, the Navy did cure the breach of the settlement agreement, albeit six years after Ms. King's removal, and she presented no evidence that the delay in amending her records harmed her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Only material breaches of a settlement agreement justify rescinding the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Housing and Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997). "Not every departure from the literal terms of a contract is sufficient to be deemed a material breach of a contract requirement...." <span class="Italic">Stone Forest Indus., Inc. v. United States</span>, 973 F.2d 1548, 1550 (Fed. Cir. 1992). A material breach relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the "essence of the contract." <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 124 F.3d at 1442. Materiality depends on "the nature and effect of the violation in light of how the particular contract is viewed, bargained for, entered into, and performed by the parties." <span class="Italic">Stone Forest</span>, 973 F.2d at 1551.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated in the previous appeal, the goal of an employee who "voluntarily resigns in exchange for purging of the records that show prior adverse action" is "to eliminate this information as it may affect future employment with the government or elsewhere." <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d at 1033. Thus, on remand the Board correctly framed the issue as whether the adverse retirement record harmed or reasonably could have harmed Ms. King's employment prospects. Although Ms. King asserts that the adverse record prevented her from obtaining permanent full-time employment, there is no evidence in the record that any prospective employer obtained the record. In fact, Ms. King has not identified any party to whom she unsuccessfully applied for work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we see no error in the Board's finding that the retirement record that the Navy failed to purge was not the type of record that a potential employer would likely seek in the course of making an employment decision. The record is not part of Ms. King's personnel file maintained by her former employing agency. Rather, it is an obscure record maintained for retirement purposes by a finance office. Therefore, it is unlikely that a prospective employer would have sought Ms. King's retirement record. Moreover, as noted above, Ms. King failed to present any evidence that anyone from whom she sought work saw the record. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Board's refusal to rescind the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither did the Board err in dismissing Ms. King's petition for enforcement of the settlement agreement as moot. The Navy purged its own records and promptly complied with the Board's recommendation to request that DFAS purge the only known uncorrected record reflecting Ms. King's removal. Accordingly, the Navy has made a good faith effort to comply with the settlement agreement. Ms. King seems to argue that the Navy should have searched for other uncorrected records. We will not impose on the Navy the burden to search every possible government record for reference to Ms. King's removal, however. We are confident that if the Navy or Ms. King discovers other uncorrected records, the Navy will continue to comply with the settlement agreement and promptly correct or request correction of the relevant records. Because the Navy has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement by purging all known records, Ms. King's petition for enforcement is moot.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Relying on <span class="Italic">King</span>, <span class="Italic">Juneja v. VA</span>, SF-1221-15-0504-C-1 (NP 6/21/2022), determined that inclusion in the OPF of information that identified the existence of a Board appeal violated a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his IRA appeal, the appellant identified the FY 2013 Proficiency Report as the personnel action that the agency took against him in retaliation for making several protected disclosures. The settlement agreement specifically called for the agency to revise the report and remove all references to the prior report from his OPF. Therefore, we find that the essence of the contract was a clean record regarding the FY 2013 Proficiency Report and that, by alerting anyone who reads the report that it was the subject of a Board appeal, it essentially negates the benefit of his bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Accordingly, we find that the inclusion of the e-Appeal information on the appellant's written comment constitutes a material breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kitt</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 9, 11 (finding that the agency materially breached a settlement agreement by retaining a record of the appellant's removal despite a provision in the agreement requiring it to change the removal to a 30-day suspension)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Notwithstanding <span class="Italic">King,</span> in <span class="Italic">Musick v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 339 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the court concluded, over the dissent of Judge Newman, who relied on <span class="Italic">King</span>, that an agreement that cabined the cleansing of records to those materials maintained in the OPF would not be read to include documents that existed apart from or outside of the OPF. But in a sequel to the <span class="Italic">King</span> litigation, <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 112 Fed. Appx. 750, 753 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), the court concluded that the settlement provision requiring all reference to the removal action be removed from Ms. King's OPF did not preclude the agency from maintaining information pertaining to the removal "for the purpose of defending itself in litigation, and to use that information if it becomes necessary to do so in the course of the litigation."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the settlement narrowly defines the expungement provisions, the Board applies the provision as written. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weithoner v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 45, 50 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 2006 MSPB 233 (2006) (agency properly expunged records from OPF, but agency never agreed to expunge all references to alleged misconduct from all agency files; agreement could not reasonably be interpreted as prohibiting agency officials from referring to matters documented in appellant's official file). <span class="Italic">Weithoner v. USPS,</span> 244 Fed. Appx. 332 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), affirmed the Board's result, but through some injection of judicial revision of what the agreement meant at the time the parties signed it: the court essentially held that the agreement could not realistically be applied, as written, to a set of circumstances that were not contemplated by the parties. The court then decided what result would have been achieved had the parties thought of the situation presented by the case at the time the agreement was drafted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Musick</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Allen v. VA</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 980, 984-87 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), another decision concluding that a settlement provision limiting inclusion of information in one file will not preclude inclusion (and disclosure) of information in another file. <span class="Italic">Allen</span> also noted that the appellant has the burden of proving that a disclosure of information violated the settlement; the appellant's case is not made out by challenging the agency's evidence of compliance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn first to the Board's 2009 Final Decision. Mr. Allen alleges that the Board erred in finding that the agency did not breach the parties' agreement by: (1) secretly maintaining a separate file holding removal-related documents "for more than a year and a half after execution of the" agreement, despite promising to remove any such documents from his OPF; and (2) disclosing removal-related documents to OWCP. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8-9. He also argues that, even if the agency was required to remove documents only from his OPF, the agency failed to provide evidence sufficient to demonstrate that all removal-related documents were, in fact, removed from the OPF. Mr. Allen additionally argues that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the agency's disclosures to OWCP were truthful. Finally, he alleges bias on the part of both the AJ and the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, the agency argues that this court should affirm the Board's decision because: (1) the agreement required the agency to remove information only from Mr. Allen's OPF, and not any other location; (2) the agreement expressly provided that the agency would truthfully disclose facts to third parties as required by law; and (3) "Mr. Allen did not bargain for non-disclosure to OWCP or for the agency to affirmatively aid him in the process." The agency also contends that there is no right to an evidentiary hearing in a petition for enforcement and that Mr. Allen's assertion of bias is unsupported.</p>

As with other contracts, our task is to "determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted, as evidenced by the contract itself." <span class="Italic">Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560. Where a "contract's words and meaning are unambiguous," its "terms are not subject to variation." <span class="Italic">Slattery v. DOJ</span>, 590 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Only where the contract is ambiguous may we look beyond the contract to determine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, we must begin by looking to the terms of the agreement to determine the parties' intent regarding the agency's obligations. <span class="Italic">See Greco</span>, 852 F.2d at 560.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen first argues that, by maintaining removal-related documents in a secret file, the agency breached its promise to "remove any and all information related to [Mr. Allen's] removal action from [his] Official Personnel File." The provision Mr. Allen cites is unambiguous. By its plain terms, it requires that Mr. Allen's "Official Personnel File" be expunged of removal-related documents, but says nothing as to any obligation to expunge those documents from other locations. Interpreting a similar provision in <span class="Italic">Musick v. DOE</span>, we held that, because the agreement "identifies only one place from which the specified material is to be removed," the "agency only obligated itself to remove pertinent material from Mr. Musick's OPF." 339 F.3d 1365, 1369. The same reasoning applies here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen's argument that the agency breached the agreement by maintaining a "secret" file containing removal documents is, thus, unavailing. When he entered into the agreement, Mr. Allen was represented by counsel, and he acknowledged that he fully understood and agreed to its provisions. Had he desired that, as part of the agreement, the agency would purge all copies of his removal documents regardless of their location, he could have bargained for such a provision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1372. Any failure on Mr. Allen's part to foresee that the agency may maintain the removal documents elsewhere is no basis for departing from the unambiguous meaning of Paragraph 10. Because the provision on which Mr. Allen relies unambiguously requires removal of documents only from his OPF--and says nothing about what the agency must do with removal documents located elsewhere--the Board correctly found that the agency did not breach the agreement by maintaining removal-related documents in files other than Mr. Allen's OPF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen also argues that, even if the agency was required to purge removal-related documents only from his OPF, the declarations submitted by the agency to demonstrate compliance with this obligation were insufficient to prove that the agency actually removed all such documents. This argument is unpersuasive, however, because it was Mr. Allen, and not the agency, who had the burden of proving breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a), which requires an agency accused of non-compliance with an agreement to come forward with evidence of compliance, the agency submitted two sworn declarations. In the first, Ms. Anderson averred that she "instructed the Health Re-source Center" ("HRC"), which maintains the agency's OPFs, "to remove from the Appellant's OPF all documentation related to his removal from the VA, and to replace this information with an SF-50" reflecting Mr. Allen's resignation. The agency also submitted a declaration from Assistant Human Resources Officer Jennifer LuttJohan of HRC confirming that "the information contained in [Mr. Allen's] OPF which referenced his removal from [the agency] was replaced with an SF-50 stating that [Mr. Allen] resigned from the VA." Ms. LuttJohan further averred that "there is no other documentation in [Mr. Allen's] OPF that shows he was disciplined or removed." Mr. Allen, on the other hand, presented no evidence showing that the agency failed to expunge all removal-related documents from his OPF other than the fact that the agency disclosed removal documents to OWCP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Allen's contention that the agency's declarations were insufficient to prove compliance conflates the agency's burden of moving forward with evidence of compliance with the ultimate burden of proving breach. While the agency was required to produce evidence "of the compliance actions that the party ha[d] completed, and a statement of the actions that are in process and the actions that remain to be taken," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a), the Board found that the agency discharged this obligation by submitting declarations averring that: (1) the agency instructed HRC to remove the relevant documents from Mr. Allen's OPF; and (2) an inspection of Mr. Allen's OPF revealed that information related to his removal had been removed and was replaced with an SF-50 reflecting Mr. Allen's resignation. Once the agency satisfied this burden of production, it was Mr. Allen who had the burden of proving that the relevant documents were not removed from his OPF. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 252, 254 (M.S.P.B. 1994) (party asserting breach bears the ultimate burden of proving facts establishing breach notwithstanding 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)) (citing <span class="Italic">Corbin on Contracts</span> (1986), &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 709 (one who asserts a breach is ordinarily required to prove facts establishing such a breach) and 1230 (the plaintiff must prove the fact of breach). The Board properly weighed the evidence presented by both sides and concluded that Mr. Allen failed to prove that the agency maintained removal related documents in his OPF, rather than in some other file. Because substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion, we find no error as to this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Retention of a WIGI denial in the appellant's OPF did not violate a settlement agreement calling for removal of the proposed removal and related documents, <span class="Italic">Azmat v. DHS</span>, PH-0432-12-0020-C-1 (NP 12/18/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency's failure to purge her OPF of the WIGI denial did not violate the settlement agreement is without merit. In relevant part, the settlement agreement provides that the agency will "[r]escind [the] Appellant's removal and remove all documents relating to this action from [the] Appellant's OPF." It does not mention anything about expunging documents relating to the denial of appellant's WIGI. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. As such, we find that the administrative judge correctly found that this provision unambiguously requires the agency to purge the appellant's OPF solely of all documents relating to the proposed removal and removal action. Further, we find that the SF-50 evidencing the WIGI denial does not constitute a document relating to the removal action. The WIGI denial was not a basis for the appellant's removal, the agency did not consider it as an aggravating factor, and it was not referenced in the proposal notice or the decision letter....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that the settlement agreement constitutes a clean record settlement agreement in which all derogatory information was to be removed from her OPF is similarly misplaced. A clean record (i.e., replacement of the SF-50 showing a removal with one showing that the appellant resigned and expungement of all references to the removal in her OPF) means that the agency must return one's personnel record "to its former state" prior to the effected adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Allen</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Torres v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 10 (2009). In purging the removal decision, notice of proposed removal, and all references to the removal from the appellant's OPF, the agency complied with the terms of the settlement agreement entered into by the parties in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kent v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 660 Fed. Appx. 916, 919 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP) (agreement that required agency to rescind removal and allow the employee to resign with a clean record did not require removal from OPF of references of prior suspensions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Shirley v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 120 MSPR 195, 203-04 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-23, 2013 MSPB 76 (2013), ascertained no violation of an agreement calling for removal of documents from an OPF when the objectionable documents, involving a law enforcement commission, were in a separate file:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we agree with the appellant that the commission file contains documents "related to" his removal. Even if the appellant is mistaken in his general assertion that documents relating to the suspension of his commission are also related to his removal, a question which we do not decide, the commission file includes at least one document, namely Woods's February 2, 2010 extension request, which refers directly to the removal proceedings. Thus, if the clean record provision of the settlement agreement applied to the commission file, we would conclude that the agency breached that provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the clean record provision specifies only that the agency was required to "remove any and all documents related to Appellant's removal from Federal service from the Appellant's OPF." This provision is analogous to the clean record provision in <span class="Italic">Musick v. Department of Energy</span>, 339 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2003), which provided that the agency would remove "all documentation relating to and culminating in Mr. Musick's removal...from his position from his [OPF]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1367. The Federal Circuit found that "the only reasonable reading of the [provision] is that the agency only obligated itself to remove pertinent material from Mr. Musick's OPF," and not from any other files it maintained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1369.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The court had previously held in <span class="Italic">King</span> that a settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to "cancel the removal action...and remove all reference to the removal action from [the employee's] Official Personnel File," required the agency to correct not only its own files, but also those maintained by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Office of Personnel Management. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 130 F.3d at 1033-34. The <span class="Italic">King</span> court reasoned that, because the mutual intent of the parties was to "purge the personnel records that are officially kept and thus might be available to a future employer," the agreement "applies to official personnel files where those files exist." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1034. The majority of the panel in <span class="Italic">Musick</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">King</span> on the grounds that Musick had not alleged that records of his removal were maintained <span class="Italic">outside</span> the agency in violation of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Musick</span>, 330 F.3d at 1369-70. The majority did not explain why this distinction would make a difference, and it would seem the rationale of <span class="Italic">King</span> should apply with equal or greater force to files maintained by the employing agency itself. We therefore tend to agree with the dissent in <span class="Italic">Musick</span> that the majority opinion in that case contravenes the court's earlier panel decision in <span class="Italic">King</span>. <span class="Italic">See Musick</span>, 339 F.3d at 1372 (Judge Newman, dissenting). Nonetheless, we are presently bound <span id="Page_5109"></span>by the majority's view that the decisions are reconcilable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. 980 (Fed. Cir. 2011), the Board considered a settlement agreement which provided that the agency was required to "remove any and all [removal-related information] from the appellant's [OPF]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The appellant in that case argued that the provision was ambiguous and that there was no meeting of the minds regarding the agency's maintenance of "secret" files containing removal-related documents. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Board followed <span class="Italic">Musick</span> and found that the agency was not required to expunge documents from agency-related files other than the appellant's OPF. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13. The Federal Circuit affirmed in a nonprecedential decision, noting that if the appellant "[h]ad...desired that, as part of the agreement, the agency would purge all copies of his removal documents regardless of their location, he could have bargained for such a provision." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 420 Fed. Appx. at 986. In light of <span class="Italic">Musick</span> and <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, we conclude that, even if the appellant and his counsel were unaware of the commission file during the settlement negotiations, the clean record provision of paragraph 4 does not apply to agency-maintained files apart from the OPF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has argued that because the commission file contains personnel information, the commission file should be considered part of the OPF. However, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant's commission-related documents are personnel records that should have been retained in his OPF, the fact remains that they were not. <span class="Italic">Cf. Musick</span>, 339 F.3d at 1370 (remanding for a determination of whether an agency-submitted document entitled "Current Employment Record," which referred to the appellant's removal and "appears to be the type of document that would be retained in an OPF" was in fact retained in Musick's OPF in violation of the settlement agreement). The presence of those documents in a separate file, maintained by a separate office in a separate location, does not constitute a breach of the clean record provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lanier v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0309-C-1 (NP 5/18/2022) ("Rather, pursuant to the unambiguous terms of the settlement agreement, the agency was only required to remove records from the appellant's "[OPF] pertaining to any proposed termination action taken against [her]." The settlement agreement does not require the agency to ensure that every system within the agency is free from references to the noticed termination and the settlement thereof, and we decline to imply such a term into the parties' unambiguous agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tom</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 395, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Shirley v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Modrowski v. VA</span>, 541 Fed. Appx. 988, 990-91 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), concurred in the Board's judgment that a settlement agreement calling for removal of unfavorable documentation from a personnel file was not breached when information about the adverse action appeared in other documents:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Modrowski does not contend, and has no basis to contend, that the agency failed, by the end of August 2002, to remove references to the 1997 removal from Mr. Modrowski's records. Instead, his challenge necessarily rests on the broader assertion that the provision impliedly imposes a further duty on the VA to keep any reference to the 1997 removal from thereafter appearing in any other records, including records in a non-employment file, in this case a file involving his claim for benefits as a veteran, not as an employee. But the settlement agreement does not fairly support that asserted implied obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At least for purposes of this implied-duty assertion, the Board's reasoning is sound: the obligation regarding "records" does not extend to disability-compensation records. Mr. Modrowski's interpretation, by focusing exclusively on the term "records," ignores the unmistakable purpose of the July 2002 settlement agreement--to resolve his status as an employee and, perhaps, ease his future employment elsewhere. The first paragraph of the agreement specifically provides that Mr. Modrowski "waives and dismisses this case and any and all claims, grievances, complaints or disputes against the [agency]...that have been made or can be made concerning his employment." Each subsequent paragraph addresses either his status as an employee or his litigation with the agency over his 1997 removal from employment. Thus, the Board did not rely on an incorrect view of the VA's contractual obligations in concluding that there was no material breach of the 2002 settlement agreement in the VA's reference to the 1997 removal in the sharply different context of Mr. Modrowski's claim for benefits as a veteran.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may guard against over-inclusive interpretation of settlement provisions requiring cleansing of certain files by securing from the appellant an agreement he will not seek adjustments of records not expressly included in the settlement, a situation described in <span class="Italic">Knight v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 113 MSPR 548, 553-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15, 2010 MSPB 80 (2010), when the appellant challenged the agency's disclosure of adverse information to an entity of the agency that was responsible for determining whether individuals could be granted status as "enrolled agents" with the ability (undefined in the Board's decision) to represent taxpayers before the agency and the IRS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, as part of the instant settlement agreement, the agency expressly agreed to "remove the SF-50 from the Appellant's Official Personnel File reflecting the Appellant's removal for misconduct, effective August 26, 2008, and to replace it with a SF-50 reflecting that [he] voluntarily retired.... The appellant does not appear to dispute on review the administrative judge's finding that the agency complied with this express provision by removing the SF-50 reflecting his removal and replacing it with an SF-50 reflecting his voluntary retirement. Further, that finding is supported by the record. We have granted the appellant's petition for review, however, to consider the appellant's contentions in light of several relevant provisions in the instant settlement agreement that were not addressed in the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Spithaler v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 1 M.S.P.R. 587, 589 (1980) (an initial decision must identify all material issues of fact and law, summarize the evidence, and include the administrative judge's conclusions of law and his legal reasoning, as well as the authorities on which that reasoning rests).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends on review, as he did below, that the agreement entitles him to further personnel records adjustment beyond issuance of an SF-50 reflecting his voluntary retirement agreement, and obligates the agency to provide him with a "clean" employment record devoid of any reference to his removal or his prior disciplinary record. For the reasons stated below, we find that the appellant's contentions in this regard are inconsistent with the express terms of the agreement itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When interpreting a settlement agreement, the Board first ascertains whether the agreement clearly states the parties' understanding. <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 255 F.3d. 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Thus, in construing the terms of a written settlement agreement, the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance.<span class="Italic"> Saunders v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 225, 229 (1997). We recognize that both the Board and our reviewing court have construed settlement agreements that provide for rescission of the original removal SF-50s and issuance of new SF-50s reflecting resignation for personal reasons as also requiring expungement of other removal-related documents from an employee's OPF. <span class="Italic">E.g., Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9 (2005). There is no indication in the two cases cited above, however, that the agreements in those cases contained express terms limiting the appellants' right to seek further adjustment of their personnel records. The agreement in this case does contain such terms. It provides that, "[e]xcept as expressly provided for in this Agreement, the Appellant waives any and all rights to seek...personnel records adjustment...." No provision in the agreement expressly requires the agency to adjust the appellant's personnel records beyond replacing the SF-50 documenting his removal with a new SF-50 documenting his voluntary retirement. Thus, we find that the express terms of the agreement clearly and unambiguously waive the appellant's right to seek adjustment of his personnel records beyond the rescission of his removal SF-50 and the replacement of that document with an SF-50 indicating that he voluntarily retired. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 627, 630 (1996) (the Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous); <span class="Italic">cf. Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 18 (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Conant</span> and interpreting a settlement agreement as permitting disclosure of removal-related information to a third party where the agreement included an express term permitting disclosure of such information as required by law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant appears to argue that the intent of the settlement agreement was to enable him to "get on with life" as an enrolled agent, and that the agency's release of information to OPR was contrary to that intent. We disagree. In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the Board examines the agreement to determine the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376. The contract provisions must be read "as part of an organic whole, according reasonable meaning to all of the contract terms" to identify and give weight to the "spirit" or essence of the contract as intended by the parties. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 17 (quoting<span class="Italic"> Lockheed Martin IR Imaging Systems, Inc. v. West,</span> 108 F.3d 319, 322 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). The key concern is that the Board "see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, by its terms, the non-disclosure provision in paragraph 10 of the settlement agreement restricts the information that the agency may provide to "future prospective employers," specifically limiting it to "the Appellant's name, positions held, pay grades, annual salary rates, duty stations, position descriptions, and job elements." It is undisputed that the information to which OPR had (or was given) access went <span id="Page_5110"></span>beyond that described in paragraph 10. Despite OPR's ability to affect the appellant's future employment prospects as an enrolled agent, it is not a "future prospective employer." Thus, the provisions of paragraph 10 did not restrict OPR's access to the information at issue here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the Board has construed settlement agreements containing neutral employment reference provisions to prohibit disclosure of removal-related information to background investigators, the agreements in those cases were construed to require expungement of that information and the disclosures in those cases were to third party investigators. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, Torres v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2009) (the agency's disclosure to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigator of removal-related information would constitute a material breach); <span class="Italic">Principe,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12 (remanding the case for a determination as to whether the appellant's current employer had obtained its removal-related documents through an unauthorized disclosure to an OPM investigator).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other provisions in the agreement also indicate that the parties did not intend to require the agency to expunge information concerning the appellant's employment history from the agency's internal records. Thus, in addition to the express term in the agreement discussed above restricting further modifications of the appellant's personnel records, the agreement also provides that "[t]he Appellant understands that the Agency may be unable to control the dissemination of other employment information if it is contacted through other means." This provision indicates that the parties contemplated that the agency would retain "other employment information" concerning the appellant. Although the settlement agreement expressly restricts disclosure of that information to future prospective employers, nothing in the four corners of the settlement agreement restricts OPR's access to, or consideration of, that information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends, in the alternative, that if the settlement agreement did not restrict OPR from considering internal agency records concerning his disciplinary history, "[t]he agency should be required to add that statements against [him] by individuals of [management] were not actual fact, but he[ar] say." We find no basis in the settlement agreement for imposing such an obligation. In this regard, we note that paragraph 9 of the settlement agreement provides that it "constitutes the full and complete agreement of the Parties," and that "[n]o other promises or agreements shall be binding unless placed in writing, signed, and dated by the Parties."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency that agreed to rescind an adverse action, provide the appellant an SF-50 showing her resignation for personal reasons, and use its best efforts to effectuate the appellant's disability retirement application, violated the agreement when the agency provided to OPM and to the Board (in the ensuing retirement appeal) negative information from the underlying adverse action case that, in turn, undermined the appellant's ability to show a connection between her medical condition and her separation from federal service, <span class="Italic">Conant v. OPM</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and its construction is a question of law which this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo. Harris v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Tretchick</span> <span class="Italic">v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 109 F.3d 749, 752 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;It is a generally accepted rule that an ambiguous contract is to be construed in accordance with the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Edward R. Marden Corp. v. United States,</span> 803 F.2d 701, 705 (Fed. Cir. 1986), but if that intent cannot be determined, the rules stated in <span class="Italic">Hills Materials Co. v. Rice,</span> 982 F.2d 514, 516 (Fed. Cir. 1992) would apply. Such is not the case here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of the Conant-IRS settlement agreement, the IRS expressly agreed to rescind its removal action against Ms. Conant and issue a new SF-50 stating she resigned voluntarily for personal reasons, and agreed to help her obtain disability retirement. In return, Ms. Conant agreed to drop her grievances and promised never to seek or accept employment with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRS has clearly breached its obligations under the agreement. In paragraph 1, the IRS stipulated that it would "rescind" the original Removal SF-50 and issue a new SF-50 stating that Ms. Conant resigned for personal reasons. By agreeing to "rescind" the Removal SF-50, the IRS promised in effect to destroy it, erasing "removal" and all reasons for such a removal from Ms. Conant's professional record with the agency. By agreeing to issue a new SF-50 in its place, the IRS promised that the only legal document recording the end of Ms. Conant's employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating she resigned for personal reasons. Accordingly, by submitting the original Removal SF-50 with Ms. Conant's disability application, the IRS breached the agreement and prejudiced the disability proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the IRS breached its obligation to use its "best efforts" to "effectuate" Ms. Conant's disability retirement, as stipulated in paragraph 11. By promising to "effectuate" Ms. Conant's application, the IRS bound itself to help Ms. Conant receive the full extent of any disability retirement available to her under law. An agency's "best efforts" to "effectuate" an employee's application for benefits do not include sabotaging that application through unproven allegations of misconduct or by submitting forms that it had promised to rescind. At a minimum, an agency's "best efforts" must include adherence to any settlement agreement that it has signed. The agency in this instance did not use its best efforts to assist Ms. Conant in obtaining, her disability retirement, but rather took affirmative steps to impede and to prejudice the process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the IRS's breach of the settlement agreement compromised Ms. Conant's disability application, both OPM and the Board failed to recognize the questionable nature of the materials submitted by the IRS. The IRS's documentation of alleged misconduct had not been adjudicated by any competent authority. The IRS had not met any burden of proving these allegations, nor had Ms. Conant been afforded the opportunity to defend herself against them. Hence, it was abuse of discretion for the Board to include such unproven allegations in its evaluation of Ms. Conant's disability application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, neither OPM nor the Board construed the Conant-IRS settlement agreement as it applied to Ms. Conant's benefits, despite the fact that the text of the settlement agreement was before each tribunal in making its determinations. Where a settlement agreement between the parties is relevant to an administrative proceeding, directly addresses an issue in dispute, and is not contrary to law, an administrative agency cannot choose to ignore the agreement. In the present case, the settlement agreement resolved the dispute surrounding Ms. Conant's proposed removal. Therefore, it was abuse of discretion for the Board not to construe the agreement as it applied to Ms. Conant's disability application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The IRS breached the settlement agreement by submitting documents it had agreed to rescind, and by using its "best efforts" to undermine rather than "effectuate" Ms. Conant's disability application when it reiterated those allegations of misconduct resolved by the agreement. This breach of the settlement agreement was not immaterial because, on the basis of the IRS's allegations, both OPM and the Board expected Ms. Conant to prove a nexus between her disability and the alleged misconduct. Because these documents and allegations materially compromised Ms. Conant's eligibility for disability retirement, we vacate the Board's decision and remand for redetermination of Ms. Conant's disability application. At the rehearing, Ms. Conant is entitled to a redetermination of her disability retirement and the Board may not consider any allegations of misconduct or documents that were infected by the breach of the Conant-IRS settlement agreement.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record shows, and it is undisputed, that the initial decision accurately memorialized verbatim, in material part, the audiotaped settlement terms, as follows: (1) The agency would "<span class="Italic">rescind</span> the appellant's December 14, 1996 removal" and would "<span class="Italic">issue</span> a Postal Form 50 indicating the appellant resigned" the same day; (2) "the terms and conditions of this agreement [would] remain confidential...except before the...Board in the event either party files a petition for enforcement"; and (3) the agreement would be entered into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, who was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> at the time she entered into the settlement agreement, subsequently filed this petition for enforcement through her current attorney. She asserted that the agency violated the agreement by advising her current employer, the Social Security Administration (SSA), that she was "fired" from the agency. After allowing the parties to submit additional evidence and argument, the AJ issued the compliance initial decision denying the appellant's petition for enforcement. The AJ found that, even if the agency did provide SSA with information regarding the appellant's removal, the agency did not breach the settlement agreement since the agreement does not contain "a neutral employment reference" provision or make any "reference whatsoever to the appellant's future employment or employers...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has timely filed a petition for review, arguing that the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to "rescind [the removal] from [her] personnel file" and by providing copies of removal-related documents to SSA in connection with a background investigation. She contends that the "entire reason for the settlement was to clean [her] employment file so that there could be no impediment to her obtaining future employment" and that, as a result of the agency's actions, she was <span id="Page_5111"></span>forced to "submit the settlement agreement to retain employment with [SSA]." The agency has not filed a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An oral settlement agreement is binding on the parties, particularly when, as here, the terms are memorialized into the record. <span class="Italic">Sargent v.

Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement terms at issue here are similar to those in <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). There, the employee entered into a settlement agreement with her employing agency, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1373. The agreement provided that IRS would "<span class="Italic">rescind</span> the SF-50 reflecting that [she] had been removed, and w[ould] <span class="Italic">issue</span> a new SF-50 reflecting that [she] resigned for personal reasons." (Emphasis added.) In connection with her subsequent application for disability retirement filed with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), IRS submitted to OPM derogatory information, including the original SF-50 documenting her removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1374. The court held that, "[b]y agreeing to '<span class="Italic">rescind</span>' the Removal SF-50, the IRS promised in effect to destroy it, erasing 'removal' and all reasons for such a removal from [her] professional record with the agency" and that "[b]y agreeing to <span class="Italic">issue</span> a new SF-50 in its place, the IRS promised that the only legal document recording the end of [her] employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating she resigned for personal reasons." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376 (emphasis added). "[b]y submitting the original Removal SF-50 with [her] disability application, the IRS breached the agreement...." <span class="Italic">Id. Conant</span> thus stands for the proposition that a settlement term providing for "rescission" of a removal and "issuance" of a SF-50 reflecting resignation should be interpreted as further requiring, "in effect," the expungement of removal-related documents from the employee's personnel file and nondisclosure of such documents to third parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On first glance, the holding in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> appears to be at odds with the general principles of settlement construction that silence as to a matter does not mean the agreement is ambiguous, <span class="Italic">De Luna v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 526, 529-30 (1993), and that the Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is unambiguous, <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 627, 630 (1996). <span class="Italic">Cf. Gizzarelli v. Department of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 269 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-31 (2001) (distinguishing settlement agreements that explicitly provide for a "clean record," "expungement," or "purging" of records from the settlement agreement there, in which "no term in the settlement agreement...[explicitly] provides for the expungement or removal of any documents..."). Any reservations we might entertain about <span class="Italic">Conant</span> are beside the point, however, since we are bound by our reviewing court's decisions<span class="Italic">. See Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed. Cir. 1987). And although <span class="Italic">Conant</span> involved an application for disability retirement, rather than a petition for enforcement as here, we cannot discern any justification for refusing to apply it here merely on that basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Conant</span> is consistent with the court's previously expressed concern in <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 170 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999), regarding "uninformed or unwary employee[s]" who enter into "clean record"-type settlement agreements<span class="Italic">.</span> The court noted in <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1372, that "[t]he agency is in a better position to know and appreciate the potential problems such agreements present, both for the employee and for the employer; at a minimum the agency has the responsibility to ensure that the employee understands the problems, and that the agreement adequately addresses them." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court thus held that, although the settlement agreement did not require "the agency...to provide a favorable reference, or even any reference at all, it was required to act [in responding to reference requests]...as if [the employee] had a 'clean record.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1371-72. The court added that "it is the Board's job to see to it that the parties receive that for which they bargained." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1372<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement terms here are materially similar to those in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> in requiring the agency to "rescind" the removal and to "issue" a new PS-50 reflecting the appellant's resignation, without explicitly requiring the agency to clean, expunge, purge, or delete removal-related documents from her personnel file or explicitly precluding disclosure of such documents to third parties. We therefore find, based on <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> that the settlement agreement here required the agency to "destroy [removal-related documents], erasing 'removal' and all reasons for such a removal from [her] professional record with the agency," and to replace the removal with the resignation, so "that the only legal document recording the end of [her] employment with the agency would henceforth be the [PS]-50 stating she resigned...." <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376. We further find that the agreement prohibited the agency from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Pagan,</span> 170 F.3d at 1371-72 (although the settlement agreement did not address the type of references the agency was required to provide, the agency was required to provide references as if the appellant had a "clean record," which it had agreed to provide). We therefore conclude that the AJ erred by finding that the settlement agreement did not impose such obligations on the agency and by finding it unnecessary to adjudicate whether the agency breached such obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> the court described an additional settlement term that required the agency to use its "best efforts" to "effectuate" the employee's disability retirement. <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d at 1376. The court stated that, by disclosing removal-related documents to OPM, the agency breached its obligation under the settlement term. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The settlement agreement here included an additional settlement term which precluded disclosure of the settlement "terms and conditions" to third parties. This term, like that in <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> is somewhat ambiguous relative to the question at issue--whether the settlement agreement precluded the agency from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties. Just as the court in <span class="Italic">Conant</span> treated the additional settlement term as providing further support for its conclusion that the agency was precluded from disclosing removal-related documents to OPM, <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376, we find that the additional settlement term here requiring confidentiality provides further support for our conclusion that the agency was generally precluded from disclosing removal-related documents to third parties....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is essentially arguing that the settlement agreement contained a nondisclosure provision. Both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have construed settlement agreements that call for rescission of a removal for cause and issuance of a Standard Form 50 reflecting a resignation to also contain implied provisions for expungement of removal-related documents from the employee's Official Personnel File and nondisclosure to third parties--in other words, a "clean record" settlement. <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this principle equally applicable to the instant case. Here, the settlement agreement calls for the appellant to accept a removal for medical inability to perform in exchange for the rescission of the removal for cause. In <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, an agency agreed to replace an employee's conduct-based proposed removal with a resignation "for personal reasons." 255 F.3d at 1373. In both situations, by agreeing to rescind and replace the prior removals, the agencies effectively agreed to erase them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1376. The substitution of a disability-based removal for a removal for cause is analogous to the substitution of a resignation. To find otherwise would unfairly relieve the agency from its responsibility to comply with the implicit clean-record provision and deny the appellant her reasonably anticipated benefit of the bargain. <span class="Italic">See Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (explaining that appellants must receive the benefit of the bargain despite the potential enforcement problems that may arise with clean record settlement agreements). As a result, we find that the settlement agreement contained an implied nondisclosure provision. The nondisclosure provision generally prevents the agency from discussing information related to the appellant's rescinded removal with third parties.[3] <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In December 2006, the appellant found a packet of materials containing credit card statements of one of his supervisors that, the appellant believed, showed misuse of a government issued credit card. The appellant forwarded the statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which forwarded them to the agency's Office of Inspector <span id="Page_5112"></span>General (OIG). OIG concluded its investigation with the finding that the supervisor's son had stolen and misused the credit card and appropriate action had been taken against the supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, made additional allegations against the supervisor, including that the supervisor had a drunken driving offense. To support his assertion regarding the drunken driving allegation, the appellant ran a criminal background check on the supervisor, using the Utah Bureau of Criminal Identifications (BCI) database. The agency suspended the appellant for 3 days for misusing the BCI database to investigate his supervisor. The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and subsequently, an individual right of action (IRA) appeal alleging that the agency suspended him in retaliation for his whistleblowing. The parties entered into a settlement agreement of the IRA appeal on February 9, 2009. The agreement provided in relevant part that the agency would cancel the 3-day suspension and purge all documents related to it from the appellant's personnel file. The agreement further provided that the parties would "keep the terms of the agreement confidential" and the agency would disclose the terms of the agreement only to those management officials that it determined needed to know specific terms to implement them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Shortly after the parties entered into this agreement, on February 26, 2009, Michael Morse, an agent with the agency's OIG, heard a rumor that the appellant and two other employees had accessed the BCI database for personal reasons. On his own initiative, Morse investigated the rumor. During the course of the investigation, Morse contacted Utah officials to request the appellant's BCI database records. When the officials, who were familiar with the appellant's earlier use of the BCI database to check on his supervisor, asked Morse what had happened as a result of that BCI database search by the appellant, Morse informed them that the appellant had received a 3-day suspension for that improper access.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency has contractually agreed to provide an employee with a clean record, both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have consistently held that the clean record agreement contains an implied provision that precludes the agency's disclosure of information regarding the rescinded adverse action to third parties. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 15; <span class="Italic">see Conant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001). According to the Federal Circuit, the agency is required to destroy discipline-related documents, erasing the discipline and all reasons for such from the employee's professional record with the agency. <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> 255 F.3d at 1376. Although most clean record settlements arise in the context of removal actions, the Board has applied the same standards to settlement agreements providing for the cancellation of suspensions. <span class="Italic">See Felch v. Department of the Navy,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 12-14 (2009) (applying the clean record standards to an indefinite suspension). We see no reason to distinguish the agreement in this case, which provided for cancellation of a 3-day suspension, from those involving removals or more lengthy suspensions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of a clean record settlement agreement, the Board has interpreted <span class="Italic">Conant</span> as "creating the general rule that if an agency discloses information regarding the rescinded adverse action to any third party, then the agency has materially breached the clean record settlement." <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 15. Furthermore, the Board has found that the appellant need not show actual harm to establish that the agency's disclosure of such information constituted a material breach. <span class="Italic">See Allison v. Department of Transportation,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6; 17 (2009); <span class="Italic">Poett v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 17 (2005). Rather, a breach of a settlement agreement is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Torres,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 9. Although "the Federal Circuit has recognized the difficult position an agency may be placed in by entering into a clean record or non-disclosure agreement, the [c]ourt has also made clear that it will not allow an agency that has willingly entered into such an agreement to breach it without being held responsible." <span class="Italic">Poett,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 19 (citing <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997)). Agencies are in a better position to understand the potential problems "clean record" agreements may create and to ensure that employees understand them and that agreements adequately address them. <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 66, &#x00B6; 8 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the settlement entered into by the appellant and the agency provided for cancellation of the appellant's suspension action and a clean record, i.e., replacement of the official personnel records showing his suspension. There is no dispute that, after the agency entered into the settlement agreement with the appellant, Morse, an agency employee, informed individuals outside the agency that the appellant had received a 3-day suspension for misuse of the BCI database. Thus, Morse's disclosure violated the parties' clean record settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has recognized a limited exception to the general rule that a clean record settlement prohibits disclosure of the cancelled action to third parties. In <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson v. Department of the Army,</span> 247 F.3d 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Federal Circuit found that public policy concerns prevailed over the terms of a settlement agreement where the settlement agreement inhibited the release of information related to criminal activity. Specifically, the court held that, as a matter of public policy, an agreement between an agency and a former employee in settlement of an appeal from an adverse action cannot be construed as barring the United States from making criminal referrals based on the underlying conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1369, 1377-78. We find that the <span class="Italic">Fomby-Denson</span> exception does not apply in this case, however. Although the appellant's misuse of the BCI could have resulted in criminal prosecution, Morse was not making a criminal referral when he revealed that the appellant had received a 3-day suspension. Instead, Morse was merely responding to the question posed by BCI officials. We find no compelling public policy in favor of Morse's disclosure that prevails over the terms of the settlement agreement.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The Board has recognized an additional exception to the general rule prohibiting disclosure of the cancelled action to third parties for situations in which the settlement agreement itself contains an explicit exception to the non-disclosure rule. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-23. Such an explicit exception is not present in the settlement agreement in this case, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's reliance on the fact that Morse was not in the supervisory chain of command at the appellant's facility, and therefore not among the individuals the responsible managers could be reasonably expected to inform that suspension was cancelled and purged, is misplaced. Regardless of his position in the agency's organizational structure, Morse was an agency employee[4] representing the interests of the agency when he disclosed the appellant's suspension, thereby denying the appellant the benefit of the clean record the agency promised him in exchange for the withdrawal of his IRA appeal. The U.S. Supreme Court has found that,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n conducting their work, Congress certainly intended that the various OIG's would enjoy a great deal of autonomy. But unlike the jurisdiction of many law enforcement agencies, an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by the [Inspector General Act], is performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">National Aeronautical and Space Administration v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</span> 527 U.S. 229, 240 (1999) (holding that an OIG investigator is an agency "representative" for the purposes of establishing an employee's right to union representation during an investigatory interview under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)). Although it might be difficult for an agency to predict which of its employees might disclose the existence of an action that was the subject of a clean record settlement agreement, disclosures such as the one at issue in this case are among the risks agencies take when entering into this type of settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Poett,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although Morse indicated during his hearing testimony that the Inspector General does not report to any agency official, and that OIG is independent of the agency, the agency's published organizational chart indicates that the Inspector General reports directly to the Secretary and that OIG is therefore a component of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <a href="https://www.va.gov/ofcadmin/docs/vaorgchart.pdf">http://www.va.gov/ofcadmin/docs/vaorgchart.pdf</a>. In his dissent, Member Robbins states that he would deny the petition for enforcement on the ground that OIG personnel cannot be bound by an agreement between an employee and non-OIG personnel. Although the Member cites <span class="Italic">Jones v. Lujan,</span> 936 F.2d 583 (10th Cir. 1991) (unpublished), as support for this proposition, we note that the court in <span class="Italic">Lujan</span> remanded to the district court for a determination of whether the plaintiff knowingly took the risk that the settlement agreement at issue in that case could not be enforced so as to prohibit an OIG investigation. There, the court observed that "[w]here the parties intended a result that was not <span id="Page_5113"></span>in their power to accomplish, a settlement agreement may not be enforceable." The court thus concluded that if the plaintiff did not knowingly take that risk, he was entitled to have the settlement agreement set aside and move for reinstatement of his original complaint. Here, the agency does not contend that the appellant knowingly took the risk that the settlement agreement could not be enforced to limit OIG employees from disclosing his suspension, and we find no indication in the record that he assumed such a risk. Therefore, even assuming that OIG personnel cannot be bound by the terms of the settlement agreement, this compels the conclusion that the settlement agreement is not enforceable and that the appeal in this case should be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we find that Morse's disclosure of the appellant's suspension violated the settlement agreement, we agree with the administrative judge that Morse's investigation did not violate the agreement.

As the administrative judge found, the agreement contains no language prohibiting the agency from disciplining the appellant for misconduct that was unknown to the agency when it entered into the agreement and uncovered by an investigation that management at the appellant's facility did not initiate or control. The investigation was the proper procedure to determine whether discipline was warranted for misconduct that was not the subject of the settlement agreement.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A settlement requiring the agency to expunge the appellant's personnel records and disciplinary action files, by removing the proposal and decision letters and all other information relating to the underlying demotion, was enforced in <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. DOJ</span>, 84 MSPR 666, 668-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-6 (2000), to require deletion of related performance appraisals, notwithstanding agency arguments that OPM regulations called for retention of those ratings for the purpose of computing RIF service credit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As evidence of the noncompliance, [Appellant] submitted an affidavit attesting that, when she inspected her performance file, she found a copy of her performance appraisal (covering the performance period of June 13, 1995 through March 28, 1997), which was the basis of the settled demotion action (the "Appraisal"). In its response, the agency claims that it did not remove the Appraisal because the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations require the retention of her last three performance ratings in connection with reduction in force procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, it is undisputed that the settlement agreement was entered into the record and that the Board has jurisdiction to enforce its terms. The settlement agreement, in relevant part, provides that the agency agreed to "expunge [the appellant's] personnel and disciplinary action files with respect to the [demotion action] by removing...<span class="Italic">all other</span> information relating <span class="Italic">to [her]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"></span> demotion." The appellant argues that her Appraisal and any reference to it should be expunged because it is "related to" the revoked demotion action. The agency contends that it did not remove the Appraisal from her performance file because it is required by regulation to retain the rating for reduction in force (RIF) purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. It argues that the appellant's "performance file," which contains the Appraisal and is maintained in connection with OPM requirements, is not a personnel record covered by the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's retention of the appellant's performance appraisal and its subsequent assertions of compliance were based on a clearly faulty understanding of the settlement agreement and the applicable OPM regulations. By definition, the Appraisal contains relevant employment "information" and constitutes a personnel record. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 293.102 (defining "information" and "record"). A "personnel record" is "any record concerning an individual which is maintained an[d] used in the personnel management or personnel policy setting process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although the regulations permit the establishment of a separate performance record system for cost and efficiency reasons, such a system is simply a subset of the personnel records. <span class="Italic">See id,; see also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 293.301-.311 and .401-.404. Accordingly, here, the agency's "performance file" is a subset of the performance record system, and is a personnel record. We find that the agency failed to comply with the settlement agreement by not removing the Appraisal from the appellant's performance file. In order to be in compliance with the agreement, the agency must remove the Appraisal from the performance file, including any reference to the unsuccessful evaluation in the Human Resource Personnel Records System. <span class="Italic">See King v. Depart</span>ment <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031, 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (finding that an agreement requiring removal of adverse action references only in OPF also required removal of such information from all official government files); <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430, 434 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that, while it is true that the agency is generally required to maintain an employee's three most recent ratings of record to determine the RIF retention standing of its competing employees, OPM's regulations provide a contingency for "missing" ratings.[*] 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.505 and .504(b) and (c). According to the regulations, when a rating is missing, an employee who has received at least one but fewer than three previous ratings of record receives credit for performance on the basis of the value of the actual rating(s) of record divided by the number of actual ratings received. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.504(c)(2). Here, when the appellant's Appraisal is removed from the performance file, it will be considered a "missing rating," if the agency must determine the RIF retention standing of its competing employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Because the term "missing rating" is not defined, we have assumed for purposes of this analysis that a rating is "missing" if it has been destroyed or lost from the employee's OPF or it is not available for use by the office responsible for establishing retention registers (i.e., not properly issued, reviewed or signed, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">generally</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.504(b)(3)).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Dougherty v. USDA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOUGHERTY_DEIDRE_DE_0432_03_0147_C_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248622.pdf">99 MSPR 161</a>, 166-67 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2005), the agency may have some responsibilities collateral to cleaning up an employment record, including issuance of SF-50 forms documenting cancelation of adverse personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We address first the appellant's claim on review relating to the agency's delay in issuing her an updated SF-50. Notably, the settlement agreement does not address specifically the agency's obligation to timely issue an updated SF-50 documenting the appellant's separation in exchange for the agency's agreement to cancel and rescind the removal action. However, the agreement makes no sense without an understanding that the agency would timely provide the appellant with an updated SF-50. Indeed, common sense dictates that the concessions the appellant sought in the form of the agency's rescission of her removal would afford her almost no benefit without an updated SF-50 documenting a voluntary separation from the agency. When the appellant declined the directed reassignment and withdrew her Board appeal in exchange for the agency's cancellation and rescission of her removal, her goal was to eliminate this negative information as it may affect future employment with the government or elsewhere. Thus, it is reasonable to interpret the agreement to require the agency to provide an updated and timely-issued SF-50 in this case. <span class="Italic">See Wells v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 228 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2001) (although the settlement agreement did not call upon the agency to issue an updated SF-50 documenting the appellant's resignation in lieu of a negative suitability determination, it was reasonable to interpret the agreement as requiring the agency to issue an updated SF-50 documenting the voluntary resignation); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("When an employee voluntarily resigns in exchange for purging of the records that show the prior adverse action, the employee's goal...is to eliminate this information as it may affect future employment....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is somewhat unclear, however, whether the agency's delay in issuing an updated SF-50 constitutes a material breach of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (a material breach relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract). It is clear that one of the major benefits sought by the appellant in agreeing to withdraw her appeal was the cancellation of her removal and a clean personnel record documenting her voluntary separation from service. She has not established, however, that the agency's undisputed delay in issuing her an updated SF-50 had a material effect on her ability to apply for, or obtain, other employment. For example, she asserts only that the agency's delay in that regard interfered with her ability to apply for federal jobs because an SF-50 is generally required to be submitted with an application for federal employment. In support of her assertion, she <span id="Page_5114"></span>submits two documents indicating "the importance" of submitting an SF-50 with an application for employment with the Department of Energy and the Department of Health and Human Services. She has not shown that she: (1) ever attempted to apply for positions with those agencies and had her applications rejected because she did not include an SF-50; (2) failed to obtain employment because a prospective employer obtained her old SF-50; or (3) refrained from applying for available jobs because the old SF-50 would have been made available to a prospective employer. On remand, the appellant shall be afforded the opportunity to present additional argument and evidence pertaining to the material impact, if any, of the agency's delay in issuing an updated SF-50.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Materiality was partially determinative of an allegation that an agency failed to cleanse a personnel document in a timely or proper manner, as required by a settlement, <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164, 171 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further contends that the agency did not timely correct the PDS-C to delete any references to his removal, which harmed him because he was referred for possible employment before the correction was made. He contends that the PDS-C should have been corrected on November 2, 1988, when he was given a new SF-50 showing resignation, and that it was not in fact corrected until January 10, 1989. The appellant's argument is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement provided that the appellant would be entitled to have his employment status changed from removal to resigned for personal reasons upon submission of evidence of rehabilitation and his application for reemployment, and that after his status was changed, the agency would correct the PDS-C to show that he resigned for personal reasons. The record shows that the agency did not receive the appellant's application until December 22, 1988. Moreover, the settlement agreement does not put a specific time limit on correcting that PDS-C. In any event, the agency has submitted an affidavit stating that the PDS-C is not made available to selecting officials, and thus even if the information concerning the appellant's removal was in the PDS-C when the appellant was referred for possible employment, he has failed to show that its inclusion harmed him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hallum v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 214, 215 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 818 F.2d 875 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The settlement <span class="Italic">Wonderly v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3373), barred release of derogatory information. The agency was in compliance when it directed a former supervisor and coworkers to refer inquiries from prospective employers to the agency personnel office. The instruction represented, according to the Board, a "prudent method of ensuring agency compliance." The agency violated the agreement when it placed the SF-50, documenting the appellant's removal, in his OPF when the settlement called for a "clean slate" following his removal. The agency also violated a provision of the agreement requiring a "fully successful" rating by only giving the rating to the appellant and not placing the appraisal in the OPF. The court explained that "[i]t is wholly inconsistent with the normal and generally expected administrative procedure where, as a matter of course, the agency places a copy of a performance appraisal in the employee's personnel file."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An entry on an SF-50 that an employee resigned under the threat of removal would likely violate a settlement agreement that adverse information not be disclosed to prospective employers, assuming that the SF-50 or its contents would be disclosed. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3387). Indirect reference to events supposed to have been expunged through a settlement was a likely violation of the settlement in <span class="Italic">Perrine v. VA</span>, 316 Fed. Appx. 995, 997-98 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (remanded for clarification of the state of the appellant's personnel records) (on appeal following remand, <span class="Italic">Perrine v. VA</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 488 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, it is not clear from the record whether the SF-50s that the agency submitted to the administrative judge are in fact part of Mr. Perrine's OPF. The SF-50s documenting Mr. Perrine's original removal action and the cancellation of that removal by definition constitute evidence of Mr. Perrine's removal from his position with the DVA. Even the SF-50 documenting Mr. Perrine's resignation--which the agency offered as proof of its compliance with the settlement agreement--includes in the "Remarks" section the following notation: "CHANGE FROM REMOVAL TO RESIGNATION." Mr. Perrine argues that the explicit references to "removal" in the SF-50s violate the terms of the settlement agreement, which required the agency to "expunge [Mr. Perrine's] record 'OPF' of the removal action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies must strictly comply with a settlement agreement that obligates the agency to "rescind," "remove," or "expunge" documentation of an employee's removal from his personnel file. In <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 255 F.3d 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), an employee who was removed from her position with the Internal Revenue Service entered into a settlement agreement with the IRS in which the agency agreed to "rescind" the SF-50 reflecting that the employee had been removed. We stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By agreeing to "rescind" the Removal SF-50, the IRS promised in effect to destroy it, erasing "removal" and all reasons for such a removal from [the appellant's] professional record with the agency. By agreeing to issue a new SF-50 in its place, the IRS promised that the only legal document recording the end of [the appellant's] employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating she resigned for personal reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Musick v. Department of Energy</span>, 339 F.3d 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2003), a settlement agreement between the Department of Energy and a former employee similarly required the agency to "remove [from his OPF] all documentation relating to and culminating in" the employee's removal. Although the agency alleged that it had properly removed all documents relating to the removal from the employee's OPF, the agency submitted as evidence an employment record that referred to a "REMOVAL," a "RESIGNATION," and a "CANCELLATION"--much like the SF-50s submitted by the agency in this case. We remanded for a factual determination as to whether the references to the removal had been retained in the employee's OPF in violation of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1370; <span class="Italic">see also Dougherty v. Dep't of Agric.</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 161, 168-69 (2005) (remanding for a determination of whether employment records had been "cleaned" of any reference to the appellant's removal); <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 66, 70 (2005) (a settlement agreement in which agency agrees to rescind the employee's removal requires the agency to erase the term "removal" from the employee's personnel record); <span class="Italic">cf.

Dep't of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 269, 279 (2001) (settlement agreements calling for "expungement," "purging," or "removal" of documents impose a strict duty of compliance on the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Perrine v. VA</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 488, 489 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), noted of an agency's retention of a litigation file:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although he complains that the agency has retained records of his removal, it is well established, as we noted in our remand decision, that an agency in such a case is entitled to maintain a separate litigation file containing documents that were expunged from the appellant's official personnel file so that, for example, the agency can respond to subsequent claims regarding its compliance with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Turner v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 330, 334 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement was not violated when the agreement, although ambiguous, required management to purge personnel records of adverse information at one location but made no reference to other locations, known to appellant, where unredacted records were maintained. The ambiguity was resolved against the appellant, whose settlement called for reference inquiries to be directed to the location where records were purged. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3021). Nor was a settlement violated that required the agency to purge from appellant's record the proposal and decision letters involving his removal. A a reference to a related arbitration award remained in the agency's National Labor Relations Information System. That system did not constitute a "personnel record." <span class="Italic">Henry v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 389, 392-93 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A broad redaction provision was considered in <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430, 432 (1987). The settlement of an adverse action required the agency, the Army, to delete and destroy "any and all information, reports, correspondence, investigations, or any other matters or materials relating to the removal from the Appellant's personnel file or any other files under its control." Sometime after the settlement, OPM obtained information about the adverse action in the course of a suitability determination. The information was obtained from CID, the Army's investigative agency for criminal matters. The appellant complained to MSPB that the settlement was violated, and the Board agreed. The settlement was broadly stated; CID was an agency within the Army; and there was no affirmative evidence that the attorney for the agency lacked authority to sign the settlement. The Board did not decide whether OPM could rely on the information to support an adverse suitability determination. The remedy ordered was that the agency to destroy the investigative files of CID concerning the charges and advise OPM that the information related to the adverse action should have been expunged and should not have been provided in the suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The implications of <span class="Italic">Rose</span> were explored in <span class="Italic">Kramer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 187 (1990), again concerning the extent that components of an agency must, as a result of a settlement, expunge records concerning an employee in another component of an agency. The agreement provided, 46 MSPR at 190-91:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency will delete and destroy any and all information, reports, correspondence, investigations, or any other matters or materials relating to these proposed actions from the appellant's personnel file or from any other files under the agency's control, except that the agency's Office of Counsel may retain attorney work product and related documents for a reasonable period, to be used only for internal review by the agency of the conduct of this appeal. After such review is concluded these retained documents will also be destroyed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board bound the agency to its bargain, <span class="Italic">Kramer</span>, 46 MSPR at 191-92:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency freely admits that the objectionable records in NIS' custody were not deleted or destroyed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5115"></span>[W]e reject the agency's argument that <span class="Italic">Rose</span>...is distinguishable from this case. In the present case, as was argued in <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, the agency contends that the agency representative was not authorized to make an agreement affecting records in the custody of another division of the agency. In <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, the Board found that the attorney of record is presumed to have authority to settle his client's case and that such a settlement will be set aside only on affirmative proof that he had no right to consent to it. We find that the agency has failed to meet its "heavy burden" of showing that Mr. Thompson lacked the authority to bind NIS....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's submission of voluminous material showing that the Navy is comprised of distinctive divisions or "commands" does not distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Rose</span>. We note that, while NIS may be a distinct "command" from the Naval Supply Center, NIS does keep records for the Navy as a "whole" entity.... Nowhere in any of this material does the agency point to any agency regulation or directive limiting the agency representative's authority in the manner alleged or making expungement of the records in question a violation of statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Department of the Navy is the party to the case and...its duly designated representative can effectively bind NIS or any other subdivision of the Navy to a settlement agreement.... Indeed, on the face of the designation of representative form, Mr. Thompson was designated to speak for the Navy as opposed to any one of its subordinate parts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that under the totality of the circumstances NIS is bound by the settlement agreement's terms. Here, the attorney of record for the agency...negotiated the settlement agreement on behalf of the Navy. He next presented the agreement to Mr. Davis, the "authorized agency official" who appointed Mr. Thompson as representative in this case. Under these circumstances, Mr. Davis had the implied authority to sign the agreement and bind the Navy.... Mr. Thompson then conveyed the written agreement to the Board for its approval and requested that it be incorporated into the record.... In so doing, he acted on behalf of the Navy and implicitly represented to the Board that the agreement was validly signed and that the Navy intended to be bound by its terms....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant can only enforce the specific terms of an agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the federal service effective August 11, 2007. The appellant filed a timely appeal with the Atlanta Regional Office. On March 18, 2008, the parties mutually entered into a "last chance/settlement agreement" that was the joint product of the employee, her representative, and the agency. One of the terms of the agreement was that the agency agreed "[t]o change the nature of Employee's Standard Form [SF] 50 bearing effective date 11 August 2007 from Removal to a 30-days Suspension."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated April 15, 2009, the agency informed the appellant that she was being denied a security clearance, in part because her history included the fact that her command "issued [her] a Notice of Removal from federal service" and because her "employment records" reflect that she received a 30-day suspension. On October 25, 2010, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement asserting that the agency breached the agreement because documentation of her removal remained in her Official Personnel File (OPF). In response, the agency asserted that the appellant's petition was untimely and that the agreement did not require that the agency purge documents related to the removal from the appellant's OPF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the written record, the administrative judge determined that the petition for enforcement was timely filed but that the agreement had not been breached because it did not include any language requiring the agency to expunge the removal from the appellant's OPF or other records. The appellant filed a timely petition for review, to which the agency filed a timely response in opposition. On June 21, 2011, the Clerk of the Board ordered the agency to provide a copy of all documents in the appellant's OPF from 2006 to the present. The agency's response shows that the SF-50 documenting the appellant's August 11, 2007 removal action remains in the appellant's OPF.</p>

By agreeing to "rescind" the Removal SF-50, the IRS promised in effect to destroy it, erasing "removal" and all reasons for such a removal from Ms. Conant's professional record with the agency. By agreeing to issue a new SF-50 in its place, the IRS promised that the only legal document recording the end of Ms. Conant's employment with the agency would henceforth be the SF-50 stating she resigned for personal reasons.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of our reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, we find that the administrative judge incorrectly relied on <span class="Italic">Cutrufello. See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Cutrufello</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 101; CID. The word "cancel," which was used in <span class="Italic">Cutrufello,</span> means "to bring to nothingness," to "omit" or "to remove."[*] <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 200 (9th ed. 1985); <span class="Italic">Cutrufello</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. at 101. Given our reviewing court's view of the meaning of the analogous word "rescind," which the dictionary defines as to "remove" or "cancel," the word "cancel" does not permit a record of a canceled SF-50 to remain in an OPF. <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 1002 (9th ed. 1985). To the extent that <span class="Italic">Cutrufello</span> held otherwise, it is expressly overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;When determining the meaning of a word, the "dictionary" and "common sense" must be followed. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's case, the agreement stated that the agency would "change the nature" of the employee's SF-50 and place the employee in a leave without pay status. The agreement did not explicitly promise to expunge all mention of the removal action from the OPF, and it made no mention of other recordkeeping systems. However, the word "change" means "to replace with another." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 225 (9th ed. 1985). In the context of this appeal and in light of the Federal Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, we hold that when the agency agreed to "change" the nature of action on the SF-50 from a removal to a suspension, and provided no express language permitting other disclosures of the removal, it was agreeing to remove any record of the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">But see Allen</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 19 (holding that if an agreement includes "express language" permitting the disclosure of removal-related information to third parties, the carved out exception will be recognized).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This holding is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM's) Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, which instructs agencies that when they process a cancellation SF-50 to substitute a new action for the original action, the agency shall "remove from the OPF the personnel action (SF 50) being cancelled." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Ch. 32-6. One example provided in the guide of a situation in which a cancellation SF-50 is warranted is "when a 15-day suspension is substituted for a 30-day suspension." <span class="Italic">See id</span>., Ch. 32-4. If OPM's guide instructs agencies to remove an SF-50 from the OPF when the length of a suspension is reduced, then it is consistent with the guide to hold that the removal of the SF-50 from the OPF is warranted when a removal action is mitigated to a suspension. However, despite the agency's agreement to change the SF-50, and the instructions in OPM's guide, the removal SF-50 currently resides within the appellant's OPF. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., Ch. 32-6. The agency has therefore breached the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A breach of a settlement agreement is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Doe v.

In this case, the agreement to "change" the SF-50 was the first sentence in the first of 16 numbered items in the agreement. As the personnel action being appealed was the appellant's removal, we hold that changing the SF-50 that reflected this action went to the essence of the contract, and that the agency's breach was therefore material.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Kitt</span> and <span class="Italic">Conant,</span> agreements calling for removal of documents from files had to be specific. For an appellant to require expungement through a settlement, the settlement must define the obligation that the appellant seeks to enforce, <span class="Italic">Cutrufello v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 99, 101-02 (1992) (overruled, <span class="Italic">Kitt v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement in this case provided that the agency would "cancel appellant's removal and appellant [would] be placed in leave without pay status from May 12, 1988 until his return to duty with the Postal Service." The appellant has not identified any provision of the agreement that requires the agency to expunge references to his removal from any files. The agency states that, although there was no agreement to expunge references to the removal from all files, it has expunged the removal notice from the appellant's official personnel folder and the supervisor's files....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends, as he did before the administrative judge, that, because the agency had not removed references to the removal action from his medical records, he was not able to transfer to the Miami Postal Facility and he had difficulty in being hired by the Bangor Postal Facility. As discussed above, however, the agreement does not contain a provision requiring the agency to remove references to the removal action from the appellant's medical record. Nor is the agreement ambiguous on the issue of expungement. It is simply silent on that point. The Board will not imply a term into an agreement that is not ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 635, 641 (1991). "Rather, in construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the four corners of the agreement itself shall be examined to determine the parties' intent." <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 642. Therefore, the Board concludes that the agency did not breach the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Mavronikolas v. United States Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 113, 116 (1992). Accordingly, any difficulty that the appellant encountered in moving from one facility to another was not caused by breach of the settlement agreement by the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agreement to expunge the record concerns the contents of the official personnel file. The agreement does not necessarily require destruction of documents. <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span> (Fed.

Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3140) (agreement to expunge notice of a proposed demotion from OPF did not preclude agency from retaining copy of the notice in separate disciplinary file; arguably, agreement did not preclude agency from disclosing notice in a state unemployment compensation proceeding). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Phillips v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 617, 619 (1993). If the settlement does not set a specific time for clearing records, the Board applies a rule of reason. A year was too long in <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 79 MSPR 206, 210-11 &#x00B6; 8 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is disinclined to read into an agreement requiring modification of some records a broader "clean records" provision that is not contained in the agreement, <span class="Italic">Crook v. DHUD</span>, 102 MSPR 340, 341-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, following the appeal of his June 4, 2004 removal, entered into a settlement agreement with the agency. The relevant portions of the agreement provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;The Deciding Official upheld the removal action and notified the appellant of that decision in a letter dated June 03, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;The Appellant submitted a letter of resignation, dated June 2, 2004, and received in the Richmond HUD office on June 9, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;The appellant denies the allegations in the Notice of Proposal to Remove. However, in order to avoid any further litigation, the parties agree that the Appellant's removal from the federal service will be changed to reflect a Resignation in Lieu of Termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's argument that the SF-50 should not show that he was terminated is inconsistent with paragraphs 4 and 5 of the agreement which reference his letter of resignation but indicate that the letter was received by the agency after the agency had issued its decision letter. More importantly, paragraph 6 of the agreement treats the appellant's removal as having been effected and states that the appellant's removal would be changed to reflect a resignation in lieu of termination. Thus, the terms of the agreement required the agency to cite the appellant's termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's implicit argument that the agency breached the settlement agreement by maintaining unspecified negative information in his file does not require a finding of breach. It is not clear whether the appellant is referring to the use of the term termination on his SF-50, or to the statement of reasons for his termination which also appear on the SF-50, or to some other unspecified information in the file. In any event, however, the settlement agreement is not a clean record agreement. While we note that the appellant requested as a remedy in his initial appeal that all negative information [be] removed from [his] file...there is no provision in the subsequent settlement agreement requiring the expungement or removal from his personnel file of any documents relating to the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> paragraph 6 of the agreement (appellant's removal from the federal service will be changed to reflect a Resignation in Lieu of Termination) with the agreement in <span class="Italic">Pagan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 170 F.3d 1368, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (appellant agreed to resign in exchange for a "clean record" with all charges and actions removed from his personnel file). Thus, the SF-50's references to the appellant's resignation in lieu of termination and to the reasons for that termination are not precluded by the language of the settlement agreement. In the absence of a requirement that the file contain no reference to the now cancelled removal action, we find that the appellant's vague references to negative information fail to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of breach and we DISMISS his petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant need not demonstrate monetary loss to set aside an agreement due to an agency's failure to cleanse his records. An agency will not be able to avoid the compliance issue by characterizing its failure as inadvertent, <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 79 MSPR 206, 211-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-13 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although the administrative judge accepted the agency's position that it "inadvertently" breached the agreement, and found that this inadvertence excused the breach, the basis for this conclusion is unclear. The agency does not deny that it was responsible for clearing the appellant's OPF; it has just repeatedly asserted that it has taken care of the problem. These belated attempts to cure its breach, however, do not mean that no breach occurred. Further, we note that because the information had already been disseminated, the breach could not be fully cured in any event<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Sena v. Department of Defense,</span> 66 MSPR 458, 466 (1995) (involving provision prohibiting disclosure of settlement terms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Sena,</span> 66 MSPR at 465. Here, the parties clearly considered the provision at issue to be of vital importance. It was this point which held up the formation of the agreement; it was only after the administrative judge expressed his strong views as to the appropriateness of this provision that the agency agreed to it and the parties were able to resolve the appeal. Further, this provision, which would mean that anyone looking at the appellant's personnel file would be unaware of the agency's removal action against him, was clearly of great importance to the appellant's future. The Board has viewed the violation of nondisclosure provisions in settlement agreements seriously, because condoning such violations would have a chilling effect on attempts to settle appeals by providing appellants with <span id="Page_5117"></span>clean records and neutral or positive employment references. <span class="Italic">See Sena,</span> 66 MSPR at 466; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Department of the Interior</span>, 60 MSPR 659, 665 (1994). While no agency official divulged information orally, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Sena</span> and <span class="Italic">Del Balzo</span>, the agency's action in permitting information to remain in the OPF had the same effect, in that information that was supposed to remain confidential did not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the appellant was able to find other employment despite the agency's breach does not negate our conclusion. In <span class="Italic">Sena,</span> for example, we found a material breach when the agency improperly divulged information about a settlement to its own employees. In our decision, we noted that the confidentiality provision that the agency breached had been very important to the appellant, not as an aid to seeking other employment, but because she wanted to avoid the embarrassment of having her co-workers know about the settlement<span class="Italic">. See Sena,</span> 66 MSPR at 465-66. The breach was material not because it resulted in a monetary loss, but because the breached provision was material to the agreement. Here, we have found that the provision at issue was material, and we decline to impose a requirement that the appellant establish monetary damages. Indeed, we note that the agency no longer disputes that the appellant's current employer is now aware of his being removed. Even if the agency's breach has not resulted in a monetary loss to the appellant, it is clearly an undesirable thing for his new employer to know, and, more importantly, it is not what the appellant bargained for with the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When one party commits a material breach of a settlement agreement, the other party is entitled to either enforce the settlement agreement or to rescind it and to reinstate his or her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sena,</span> 66 MSPR at 463. Here, the appellant has asked that his appeal be reinstated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that because the breach of a nondisclosure provision cannot be fully cured, "enforcement" is of limited usefulness as a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Sena,</span> 66 MSPR at 466. Nevertheless, the appellant may wish to reconsider his request that the appeal be reinstated in light of the fact that reinstatement of the appeal could only occur if the agreement is rescinded. If the agreement is rescinded, the settlement terms become inoperative. <span class="Italic">See Stipp v. Department of the Army</span>, 64 MSPR 124, 127 n.1 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled in part</span> <span class="Italic">on other grounds, Wisdom v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 MSPR 652 (1998). He would thus risk losing any benefits he has received under the agreement. Accordingly, this appeal must be remanded to permit the appellant to make an informed choice between rescinding and enforcing the agreement. If the appellant chooses to rescind the agreement, then the removal appeal must be adjudicated on its merits.</p>

VA</span>, SF-1221-15-0504-C-1 (NP 6/21/2022) ("Because we find that the agency breached a material provision of the settlement agreement, the appellant is not required to establish that the breach caused him actual harm. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 13 (1998) (explaining that the breach was material not because it resulted in a monetary loss but because the breached provision was material to the agreement).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expungement of records may have collateral consequences, in <span class="Italic">Singleton v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 424, 426-27 (1994), involving an agreement calling for withdrawal from the OPF of documents related to the appealed action. The records of past discipline had to be expunged and other discipline based, in part, on that past discipline had to be reconsidered by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The relevant portions of the agreement provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;Cancel the fourteen (14) calendar day suspension which was effected from May 11, 1992, through May 24, 1992. Withdraw all <span class="Italic">related</span> (emphasis supplied) documents from the Official Personnel Folder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant alleged that the agency violated its obligation to withdraw all related documents from the OPF because it used a reprimand that was cited as a past record in the 1992 suspension as a past record in a 1993 suspension....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing a settlement agreement the Board looks to the terms of the agreement to determine the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Perry v. Department of the Army</span>, 992 F.2d 1575, 1578-79. (Fed. Cir. 1993). At issue here is the meaning of the phrase "related documents" as used in the withdrawal provision of the settlement agreement. The administrative judge found that this phrase included the reprimand. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of the proposed 1992 suspension specifically stated that the reprimand would be taken into consideration in determining the appropriate disciplinary action, and the decision notice stated that the reprimand was considered in arriving at the determination to suspend appellant for 14 days. Consideration of the reprimand in determining the appropriate penalty makes the reprimand a document related to the 1992 suspension. If the reprimand were not related to the 1992 suspension, it would not have been mentioned in both the proposal and the decision notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the reprimand is not related to the 1992 suspension because the reprimand does not reference the suspension and because the reprimand and the suspension were based on totally separate charges. The agency's argument is based on a misinterpretation of <span class="Italic">Shafer v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 164 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 935 F.2d 280 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Shafer</span>, a settlement agreement required an agency to expunge from its official records information "directly related" to a cancelled removal action. The Board found that evidence of the past disciplinary record referenced in the cancelled removal action was not "directly related" to the removal because it "was considered simply as an aggravating factor in imposing the penalty of removal." 46 MSPR at 170. Because the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Shafer</span> called for the expunction of information that was "directly related" rather than "related," it is not controlling in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the agency has recently removed the reprimand from appellant's OPF. However, this does not render the issue moot because the 1993 suspension relied on the reprimand in assessing the penalty. As the reprimand should have been withdrawn from the OPF at the time of the 1993 suspension, it was improper for the agency to have considered it. Accordingly, to be in compliance, the agency must reconsider the penalty in the 1993 suspension without the reprimand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pagan v. VA</span>, 170 F.3d 1368, 1369-72 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (a "clean record" settlement requires the agency to provide information to prospective employers that is consistent with a clean record, i.e., to cast references in a positive tone and to avoid statements or omissions in references that would key a future employer to a past problem with the current employer).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Settlement agreements often include provisions regarding rescission or destruction of records from the OPF or other agency files, but the agreements include a provision allowing the agency to keep a copy or the originals of those documents in the litigation file maintained by its counsel. <span class="Italic">Benfield v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/09-3198.pdf">347 Fed. Appx. 586</a> (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), apparently implied document retention authority when the settlement did not explicitly provide for it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Benfield relies on <span class="Italic">King v. Department of Navy,</span> to argue that the Army's obligations to purge files of any reference to Benfield's removal extended to all existing files of the Army, not just Benfield's personnel file. In <span class="Italic">King</span> we interpreted a settlement agreement containing the phrase "remove all reference to the removal action from her Official Personnel File" as requiring the Navy to purge documents from any official Government personnel files that may affect future employment, including those held in personnel files by agencies other than the Navy. 130 F.3d at 1033-34. <span class="Italic">King</span> does not apply here. The documents Benfield cites as a breach of the Settlement Agreement are located in litigation files in Fort Belvoir's legal office, not in any official personnel file. They are maintained for internal use by the Army's legal staff and their availability is limited. Unlike the documents in <span class="Italic">King,</span> none of the documents cited by Benfield would affect his future employment in the Government or elsewhere because they would not be available to prospective employers. Thus, there is no reason to interpret the clear language of the Settlement Agreement to include the removal of documents from files other than the Army's physical and online personnel files for Benfield, which the Army has already properly purged.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baig v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 269, 275-76 (1995), implied the right of the agency to maintain a litigation file--unless there exists an exceptionally broadly-stated clause mandating destruction of all records:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven assuming that the appellant made this argument, the intent of paragraph five did not include the expungement of an appeal file kept by the Counsel's Office. Moreover, by inserting paragraphs one and seven in the agreement, which provide that the appellant agrees not to file an appeal relating to any of the events and causes of action underlying the settlement agreement, the parties could not have intended to expunge an agency's appeal or litigation file, because to do so would leave the agency defenseless in the event of the appellant's breach of these provisions. In this regard, we note that the Board has held in cases where disciplinary actions have been reversed, that an agency may retain a separate file containing documents related to the disciplinary action as long as the agency observes appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Normoyle v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 391, 396 (1994); <span class="Italic">Kellus v. US Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339 (1987). Similarly, we find that while the settlement agreement does not require the expungement of the MSPB file, the agency must observe appropriate safeguards so as not to injure the appellant's employment prospects or otherwise affect the confidentiality of the MSPB appeal file. The agency has provided sworn statements that information relating to the underlying disciplinary action has been deleted from its "routine records" from which a prospective employer might inquire such as the appellant's personnel records and the files of the Engineering Directorate where the appellant had worked. Moreover, the appellant has failed to specify any records other than the appeal file which contain references to the rescinded disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this settlement agreement contrasts markedly from other settlement agreements calling for the expungement of records. While the settlement agreement in this case directed the agency to <span id="Page_5118"></span>delete material relating to his removal only from "routine records" in a paragraph addressing inquiries of prospective employers, the settlement agreement in <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430, 432 (1987), directed the agency "to delete and destroy" any material relating to the removal from "the Appellant's personnel file <span class="Italic">or any other files under its control</span>." (Emphasis supplied). The <span class="Italic">Rose</span> agreement also stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is the full intentions [sic] of the parties to this that <span class="Italic">all records</span> of any such removal action or any detrimental information which may have been recorded by Respondent [agency] in its investigation be destroyed in full....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (Emphasis supplied). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, the Board found that the agency's criminal investigation division's retention of information relating to the appellant's removal was a breach of the settlement agreement because, unlike here, the agreement's expungement provision was "broadly inclusive in scope" and unquestionably included the retained information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 434.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kramer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR at 190-91, the settlement agreement contained an expungement term that stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The agency will delete and destroy any and all information...relating to these proposed actions from the appellant's personnel file <span class="Italic">or from</span> <span class="Italic">any other files under the agency's control</span>, except that the agency's Office of Counsel may retain attorney work product and related documents for a reasonable period, to be used only for internal review.... After such review is concluded these retained documents will also be destroyed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis supplied). The Board found, as in <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, that the agency's retention of information relating to the removal action in the agency's investigative branch division files was a breach of the settlement agreement because the settlement agreement specifically included such information. 46 MSPR at 191-92. Here, the settlement agreement did not include the agency's response to the EEOC complaint or the "MSPB file" as the type of information the parties intended to expunge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baig</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. DOJ</span>, 88 MSPR 315, 316-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-7 (2001), permitting an agency to maintain documentation of the settled personnel action in an "MSPB file"--at least in the absence of a settlement clearly calling for the destruction of all records:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On March 31, 2000, the appellant claimed that although the agency had removed the appraisal from its performance files, the agency had placed information of the disciplinary action (demotion) into an "informal file" which the agency has characterized as the "MSPB file" or litigation file. The appellant alleges that this action by the agency again denies her relief called for in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement, in relevant part, provides that the agency agreed to "expunge [the appellant's] <span class="Italic">personnel and disciplinary action files</span> (emphasis added) with respect to the [demotion action] by removing...all other information relating to [her] demotion and issuing a Notification of Personnel Action Standard Form (SF 50) which does not reference this matter."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 25, 2000, the agency submitted a response stating that it had fully complied with the Board's order and the terms of the settlement agreement. The agency does not dispute the existence of an "MSPB file," but asserts that the MSPB file is not a personnel or disciplinary action file within the meaning of the settlement agreement and therefore is not subject to the expungement requirement of paragraph 2. According to the agency, the MSPB file is to be used to defend itself if the appellant should file future appeals. The agency relies, in part, on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Baig v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 269 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In construing a settlement agreement the Board looks [to] the terms of the agreement to determine the intent of the parties. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). At issue here is the meaning of "personnel and disciplinary action files" as used in the expunction provision of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's view that the "MSPB file" should be treated as an agency file subject to expunction appears to be based on the faulty premise that all agency files relating to the cancelled demotion are subject to expunction under the agreement. The language of the agreement, however, is not so broadly inclusive. Rather, the plain words of the agreement make a distinction between different types of personnel records and limit the expunction requirement to personnel and disciplinary files. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> with <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430, 432 (1987) (settlement agreement required agency "to delete and destroy any and all information...relating to the removal from the Appellant's personnel file or any other files under its control").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement here to expunge the appellant's personnel and disciplinary and adverse action files could be viewed as similar to the requirement in <span class="Italic">Baig</span> to expunge all references of a disciplinary action from its "routine records." <span class="Italic">See</span> 66 MSPR at 272, n.1. The Board stated in <span class="Italic">Baig</span> that the intent of the expungement provision did not include expungement of the "MSPB file" maintained by the agency's Counsel office. The Board found support for this interpretation by looking to the other provisions of the settlement pertaining to the appellant's agreement not to file an appeal relating to any of the events and causes of action underlying the settlement agreement. The Board explained that to interpret the expunction provision as extending to the "MSPB file" would leave the agency defenseless in the event of the appellant's breach of these provisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 275.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly here, the settlement agreement contains a provision requiring the appellant to withdraw her complaint before the Board and a promise "not to raise the subject of this action, or the corrective actions resulting from this subject matter or Settlement Agreement, in any court or forum or before any administrative body, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." Given the above provision of the settlement, coupled with the lack of a requirement that all agency records relating to the demotion be destroyed, we agree with the agency that it is not required to expunge its MSPB file. Nevertheless, we find that while the settlement agreement does not require the expungement of the MSPB file, the agency must observe appropriate safeguards so as not to injure the appellant's employment prospects or otherwise affect the confidentiality of the MSPB appeal Me. <span class="Italic">See Normoyle v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 63 MSPR 391, 396 (1994); <span class="Italic">Kellus v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 335, 339 (1987), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Andress</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 56 MSPR 501 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perrine v. VA</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 488, 489 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP) ("[i]t is well established, as we noted in our remand decision, that an agency in such a case is entitled to maintain a separate litigation file containing documents that were expunged from the appellant's official personnel file so that, for example, the agency can respond to subsequent claims regarding its compliance with the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 330, 334 (2006)."); <span class="Italic">Fenlon v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SF-0432-04-0076-C-1 (NP 9/13/2012) ("Moreover, it is for this very reason that the Board has sanctioned the maintenance of removal-related documents in other agency files. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Baig v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 269, 275 (to require the agency to expunge its appeal or litigation file would leave the agency defenseless if the appellant breaches the settlement agreement), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). In a case like this where a disciplinary action was reversed pursuant to a settlement agreement, 'an agency may retain a separate file containing documents related to the disciplinary action as long as the agency observes appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosures.' <span class="Italic">Baig</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 275.").<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Godwin v. DOD</span>, 228 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2000), an agency's agreement to strip negative information from an OPF does not bar the agency from removing positive information. The agency's explanation was that it was standard procedure for the agency to remove "temporary documents," including the "employee performance file" from an OPF before forwarding the file to a new agency.
