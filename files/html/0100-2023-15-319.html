<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations provide guidance for actions taken against employees who do not meet medical or physical standards associated with their positions. In part, those regulations provide, at 5 CFR Part 339 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 339.102 <span class="Italic">Purpose and Effect</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Failure to meet medical (which may include psychological) standards and/or physical requirements established under this part means that the applicant or employee is not qualified for the position, unless reasonable accommodation or a waiver is appropriate, in accordance with &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 339.103 and 339.204. An employee's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, in accordance with a proper agency order authorized under this part, constitutes a basis for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action. After a tentative job offer of employment conditioned on completion of a medical examination, an applicant's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, may result in the applicant's removal from further consideration for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 339.103 <span class="Italic">Compliance with disability laws</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Amendments Act of 2008 (collectively the ADA), establishes prohibitions against discrimination and the requirements for reasonable accommodation that apply to the Federal Government through the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <span class="Italic">as amended</span>, 29 U.S.C. 791(f). Consequently, actions under this part must comply with the non-discrimination provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the non-discrimination provisions of the ADA, and their implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 339.202 <span class="Italic">Medical standards</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM may establish and/or approve medical standards for a Governmentwide occupation (i.e., an occupation common to more than one agency) or approve revisions to its established medical standards. An individual agency may establish medical standards for positions that predominate in that agency (i.e., where the agency has 50 percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be justified on the basis that the duties of the positions are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status for successful performance when the nature of the positions involves a high degree of responsibility toward the public or sensitive national security concerns. The rationale for establishing the standard must be documented and supported by a study(ies) or evaluation(s) establishing the medical standard is job-related to the occupation(s). Medical standards established by agencies must be approved by OPM prior to implementation. Standards established by OPM or an agency must be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Established by written directive and uniformly applied, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Directly related to the actual performance and requirements necessary for the performance of the duties of the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 339.203 <span class="Italic">Physical requirements</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An agency may establish physical requirements for individual positions without OPM approval when such requirements are considered essential for performance of the duties of a specific position. Physical requirements must be clearly supported by the actual duties of the position, documented in the position description, and supported by a study(ies) or evaluation(s) establishing physical requirement(s) is job-related to the occupation(s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An applicant or employee may not be disqualified arbitrarily on the basis of physical requirements or other criteria that do not relate specifically to performance of the duties of a specific position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 339.206 <span class="Italic">Disqualification on the basis of medical history</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee or applicant may not be disqualified for any position solely on the basis of medical history. For positions subject to medical standards and/or physical requirements, and for positions under medical evaluation programs, a history of a particular medical condition may result in medical disqualification only if the condition at issue is itself disqualifying, recurrence of the condition is based on reasonable medical judgment, and the duties of the position are such that a recurrence of the condition would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the applicant or employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-26 (2022), clarified, modified, and synthesized decisions involving removals for inability to meet medical standards for positions. The decision, a complex analysis that modified existing law and attempted to explain OPM regulations concerning medical standards and physical requirements, and disqualification based on medical history, note above, arrived at a couple conclusions concerning the burdens of proof (and, discussed later in this chapter, disability accommodation requirements). As to those burdens of proof, a summary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;"5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 provides that an employee may not be removed from a position subject to medical standards 'solely on the basis of medical history.' The regulation provides an exception only if the condition itself is disqualifying, recurrence 'is based on reasonable medical judgment,' and the position's duties are such that a recurrence 'would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the...employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;"For cases involving a charge of inability to perform that do not fall under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206, when the removal is based on a current medical condition, the agency must prove either a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that his condition may result in injury to himself or others."
With those comments, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Haas</span>:
</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We take this opportunity to clarify the proper standard for the removal of an employee from a position with medical standards, such as the CBPO, based on a current medical condition that impacts his ability to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 provides that an employee may not be removed from a position subject to medical standards "solely on the basis of medical history."[1] The regulation provides an exception only if the condition itself is disqualifying, recurrence "is based on reasonable medical judgment," and the position's duties are such that a recurrence "would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the...employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk."[2] This regulation does not define the meaning of the term "medical history." However, 5 C.F.R. part 339 contains a provision stating that a "history of...medical condition(s)...includ[es] references to findings from previous examinations, treatment, and responses to treatment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.104(1). This explanation of medical history suggests that such a history exists when the employee's medical records indicate that he was examined or treated for the medical condition in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;For the sake of simplicity, this decision will exclusively refer to positions with medical standards, but the regulation also applies to positions subject to "physical requirements" and those "under medical evaluation programs." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Effective March 21, 2017, five months after the agency proposed the appellant's removal but weeks before its effective date, the Office of Personnel Management amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 as to the degree of risk required. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 (indicating an effective date of March 21, 2017); Medical Qualification Determinations, 82 Fed. Reg. 5340-01, 5346-47, 5352 (Jan. 18, 2017) (Final Rule), 82 Fed. Reg. 10959-01 (delaying the effective date of the Final Rule to March 21, 2017). The previous version required only a "reasonable probability of substantial harm." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 (2017). Because <span id="Page_2862"></span>we find, as discussed below, that the regulation does not apply to the agency's charge here, we need not address whether the changes to the regulation apply retroactively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the dictionary defines "history" to include "an account of a patient's medical background." Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 549 (10th ed. 2002). Further, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) expressed the intent that actions covered by 5 C.F.R. part 339 comply with the nondiscrimination provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.103(a). The ADA defines disability to include a "record of...an impairment," as distinct from having a current impairment. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A), (B). The ADA's implementing regulations provide that an individual has a record of impairment if he "has a history of, or has been misclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(k). Given these definitions, we find that a removal is based solely on medical history if the only basis for concluding that the employee is medically unable to perform the core duties of his position is the fact that his medical records reflect that, at some time in the past, he was classified as having, was examined for, or was treated for the medical condition or impairment in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to our current finding and beginning with <span class="Italic">Lassiter v. Department of Justice</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 138, 141-42, 146 (1993), the Board applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 to all cases in which an appellant who was subject to medical standards was removed for medical inability to perform his position. It applied this standard regardless of whether an appellant's medical history was the sole basis for his removal. For example, in <span class="Italic">Lassiter</span>, the Board recognized that the appellant had not shown that he had been cured of his delusional paranoid disorder, which had been the basis for his removal. 60 M.S.P.R. at 145-46 &#x0026; n.3. It nonetheless found that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 represented the proper standard for the agency's charge because the appellant occupied a position subject to medical standards. 60 M.S.P.R. at 141-42. In making this finding, however, the Board failed to cite or consider the regulatory requirement that the appellant's removal be "solely on the basis of medical history." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Lassiter</span>, the Board continued to apply the same standard to cases involving present medical inability to perform. <span class="Italic">See Sanders v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 144, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 11-16, 18-19 (applying the standard in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 when an appellant was removed based on his inability to perform his duties due to an existing medical condition, rather than his medical history), <span class="Italic">aff'd per curiam</span>, 625 F. App'x 549 (Fed. Cir. 2015); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 8 (2014) (applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 when an appellant was removed based not only on her medical history but also on current physical restrictions affecting her ability to perform her job duties); <span class="Italic">Slater v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 13-17 (2008) (finding that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 applied to the removal of an employee due to his current diabetes-related polyneuropathy, which caused his inability to perform his duties safely and efficiently without undue risk of harm to self or others). These cases continued the error of applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 to a charge of inability to perform involving current medical conditions. We overrule this line of cases to the extent that the Board applied 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 to a charge of medical inability when the appellant was removed based on his current medical condition or impairment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For cases involving a charge of inability to perform that do not fall under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206, the agency must prove either a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that his condition may result in injury to himself or others. <span class="Italic">Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5 (2014); <span class="Italic">Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2014).[3] The Board has otherwise described the standard as requiring that the agency establish that the appellant's medical condition prevents him from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5; Fox, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In both <span class="Italic">Fox</span> and <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, the Board rejected the application of <span class="Italic">Slater</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 419, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 13-17, and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 because the employees at issue did not occupy positions with medical standards. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 24. But in doing so, those decisions suggested that the general standard for inability to perform could not apply to positions with medical standards. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 25. Our decision in the instant appeal finds otherwise. Therefore, the caveat alluded to in <span class="Italic">Clemens</span> and <span class="Italic">Fox</span>--that the employee does not occupy a position with medical standards or physical requirements or that is subject to medical evaluation programs in order for the general standard to apply--is no longer operative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of whether the <span class="Italic">Clemens</span> standard or the standard under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 applies may well be outcome determinative in some cases. If section 339.206 is applied, an agency must prove that recurrence of the condition poses "a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the...employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk." <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 11 &#x0026; n.2. Here, the parties agree that the appellant has bipolar disorder. Although the appellant was "asymptomatic" at the time of his removal, the parties agree that he had this medical condition when he was removed. In removing the appellant, the agency cited to his bipolar disorder as causing him to be unable to carry a weapon or perform other functions related to law enforcement. If the standard from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206 were applied to the instant appeal, the agency would be required to prove that recurrence would pose a risk of harm, even though, as discussed below, the appellant's removal was not solely based on his medical history of bipolar disorder, but also on his present inability to perform his core duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, in essence, that his removal was based solely on his medical history. For example, the appellant argues that because he was "asymptomatic" and his bipolar disorder was in "remission," the agency's determination that he was medically unable to perform his core duties is speculative. We disagree. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found, and the Board has followed, that when "a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature 'permanent or progressive' in severity, it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent rebuttal evidence of record to the contrary." <span class="Italic">Pyles v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 415 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">see Walker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 158, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). The National Institute of Mental Health explains that bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness characterized by "periods of unusually intense emotion, changes in sleep patterns and activity levels, and uncharacteristic behaviors," typically recurring over time. National Institute of Mental Health, <span class="Italic">Bipolar Disorder</span>, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/ health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml">https://www.nimh.nih.gov/ health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml</a> (last visited Nov. 7, 2022).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may not have exhibited symptoms to the IME psychiatrist or his health care providers, one of his health care providers indicated that his condition is chronic and that the appellant "is to be monitored for any acute decompensation." She further stated that it was not possible to predict the likelihood that an individual with bipolar disorder would decompensate and that any changes in the appellant's schedule could cause him to decompensate in mood. Further, the IME psychiatrist testified that individuals suffering from bipolar disorder may not realize in advance that they have become symptomatic.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also asserts that it was unlikely he would become symptomatic because he successfully performed in his position for 17 years. He points to his "successful" performance ratings from October 1, 2012, to November 30, 2016, successful completion of training throughout his employment with the agency, and receipt of letters of commendation and awards. We are not persuaded that this evidence outweighs contrary evidence showing the appellant continued to have symptomatic episodes leading up to his April 2017 removal. In particular, the IME psychiatrist described the appellant's prognosis as "guarded because of his history of worsening symptoms when under stress." The appellant represented to the IME psychiatrist that he had a serious single car accident in 2008, after leaving work due to trouble thinking and focusing, as a result of what was diagnosed at the time as "work shift disorder." Further, the appellant had what he described as a "relapse" in September 2014. According to the appellant's health care provider, he reported to her in January 2015 that "mood reactivity had occurred at work in which he cussed a co-worker" and he had asked to start seeing a counselor. On forms the appellant submitted in connection with the August 2015 IME examination, he indicated that he suffered from episodes of depression, periods of anxiety, and sleep disorders. In sum, at the time of his removal, the appellant had a present medical condition that could manifest symptoms at any time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We affirm the administrative judge's finding that the agency proved its charge, as modified to apply the correct standard</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge applied what we have now determined to be the incorrect standard to the agency's charge, remand is unnecessary because the record is fully developed on the relevant issues. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Forte v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 27 (2016) (deciding an issue on review, rather than remanding, when the administrative judge applied an incorrect standard but the record was fully developed). As noted above, when as here the removal is based on a current medical condition, the agency must prove either a nexus between the employee's medical condition and observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct, or a high probability, given the nature of the work involved, that his condition may result in injury to himself or others. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25. In other words, the agency must establish that the appellant's medical condition prevents him from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2863"></span>The Board has indicated that the core duties of a position are synonymous with the essential functions of a position under the ADA, as amended by the Americans With Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), i.e., the fundamental job duties of the position, not including marginal functions. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 6; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1). One of the bases for finding that a function is essential is that it is the "reason the position exists." <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 6; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(2)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the relevant position description and associated medical standards, CBPOs are "frontline" uniformed, weapon-carrying border security officers whose "primary function" includes "detect[ing] and prevent[ing] terrorists and instruments of terror from entering the United States" and ensuring border security. A CBPO must be "prepared mentally and physically to respond to unexpected situations and have the functional capacity to defend self and others from threatening situations in which the use of deadly force may be necessary." They "must be free of any organic, structural or functional impairment(s) or existing health problem(s) that would be aggravated in response to the work environment and/or would affect safe and efficient job performance." Additionally, they must "exercise sound judgment, maintain mental alertness at all times, and function under dynamic and stressful conditions in which there are time constraints, concerns for national security, and threats of terrorism."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency based its charge on the appellant's inability to perform these functions of his position. The administrative judge found that these duties were essential functions of the appellant's position. The parties do not dispute this finding.[4] Accordingly, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's duties set forth above are essential, and thus, constitute core duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In support of its charge, the agency also alleged that the appellant was unable to perform Hard Secondary duties. The administrative judge found that performing Hard Secondary inspections was an essential function of the appellant's position. She also concluded that he was medically unable to perform these duties. In light of our finding, below, that the appellant could not perform his position's duties as described herein, we do not address the parties' arguments related to whether Hard Secondary inspections were also an essential function of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also determined that the agency proved that the appellant was medically unable to perform these core duties, thus proving its charge. She found persuasive the IME psychiatrist's testimony that the appellant was unable to use proper judgment, make quick decisions in law enforcement situations, or carry a weapon when symptomatic, as required for his position. We agree with this conclusion and modify her reasoning to the extent that she relied on the standard in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206. In particular, we vacate as unnecessary the administrative judge's conclusion that recurrence of the appellant's symptoms could not be ruled out. Because the appellant's removal was not based solely on his medical history, the agency was required to establish only that his medical condition prevented him from being able to safely and efficiently perform the core duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5. The appellant's arguments as to the likelihood of recurrence are, therefore, misplaced, and we decline to address them further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, in determining whether the agency has met its burden, the Board will consider whether a reasonable accommodation, short of reassignment, exists that would enable the appellant to safely and efficiently perform his core duties. <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 5. The appellant relies on the current version of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.206, which requires an agency to consider whether reasonable accommodation or other efforts may "eliminate[ ] or reduce[ ]" the risk of harm an employee poses to self or others, to argue that the agency could have reduced or eliminated the risk of recurrence if he were granted certain scheduling accommodations.[5] However, because the agency did not remove the appellant solely based on his medical history, it was not required to prove that it could not eliminate or reduce the risk of recurrence via accommodation. Rather, the agency removed the appellant because he was not medically able to perform the core duties of his CBPO position. We agree with the administrative judge that the agency proved that it could not provide a reasonable accommodation that would enable the appellant to perform his position's core duties. In making this finding, the administrative judge relied on the opinion of the IME psychiatrist that the appellant had not been symptom free for sufficient time to be fit for a weapons-carrying position. Specifically, the IME psychiatrist explained that, in his view, the appellant would need to remain symptom free and stable for 5 years before he might be fit to carry a weapon.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The parties agree that the appellant's scheduling restrictions did not affect his ability to perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant questions the administrative judge's reliance on the IME psychiatrist's opinion, we are not persuaded. In reaching her conclusions, the administrative judge properly weighed the medical evidence. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 11 (recognizing that in assessing the probative weight of medical opinions, the Board considers whether the opinion was based on a medical examination and provided a reasoned explanation for its findings as distinct from mere conclusory assertions, the qualifications of the expert rendering the opinion, and the extent and duration of the expert's familiarity with the treatment of the appellant). For example, she considered that the IME psychiatrist met with the appellant for more than 4 hours, provided an extensive explanation of his conclusions, had relevant experience, and was certified in forensic psychiatry. The appellant's health care providers expressed the belief that he was fit for duty. The administrative judge found the opinions of the appellant's health care providers lacked reasoned explanations. The appellant provides no specific argument as to why the administrative judge's assessment was mistaken, and we can discern none.
