<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-68"><span class="space">3.</span> Military Service</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA), a reservist's time for responding to an adverse action is tolled during active duty; once that duty ends, the appeal period begins to run. The Board provided some explanation of the provisions of the SSCRA in <span class="Italic">Henry v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 555, 558-59 (1996), involving an appeal that was not refiled within the time permitted by an order dismissing the case without prejudice to its subsequent refiling:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened the appeal, however, in order to consider the effect of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act (SSCRA) on the timeliness question presented here. The SSCRA provides in pertinent part that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]he period of military service shall not be included in computing any period now or hereafter to be limited by any law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in any court, board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of government by or against any person in military service or by or against his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, whether such cause of action or the right or privilege to institute such action or proceeding shall have accrued prior to or during the period of such service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 50 USC App. &#x00A7; 525. The courts have held the language of the SSCRA to be clear and unambiguous and its tolling provision unconditional. The only critical factor is military service; once that circumstance is shown, the period of limitations is automatically tolled for the duration of service. <span class="Italic">See Mason v. Texaco Inc.</span>, 862 F.2d 242, 245 (10th Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Bickford v. United States</span>, 228 Ct. Cl. 321, 656 F.2d 636, 639 (1981); <span class="Italic">Ricard v. Birch</span>, 529 F.2d 214, 216-17 (4th Cir. 1975).[1] A serviceman seeking the protection of the tolling mechanism, moreover, need not show that the circumstances of his military service actually impaired his ability to pursue his legal rights in a timely fashion. <span class="Italic">See Conroy v. Aniskoff</span>, 507 U.S. 511, 513-18, 113 S. Ct. 1562, 1564-67, 123 L. Ed.2d 229 (1993); <span class="Italic">In re A.H. Robins Co., Inc.</span>, 996 F.2d 716, 718 (4th Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The term "military service" means periods of active duty, pre-induction training and education, and absence from duty due to sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> 50 USC App. &#x00A7; 511.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the applicability of the SSCRA has not previously been raised during the adjudication of this appeal. Nonetheless, "orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental <span id="Page_956"></span>justice," especially when this statute is couched in such mandatory and unambiguous terms. <span class="Italic">See Ricard</span>, 529 F.2d at 216 (applying the SSCRA although the issue had not been raised in the district court). In an unsworn but unrebutted statement, the appellant claimed active-duty military service from August 29, 1994, through June 30, 1995, and he supported that claim with military documents ordering him to active-duty service. Absent any contradiction of this claim in the record, the SSCRA therefore requires us to exclude this period of service in computing the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Bickford</span>, 656 F.2d at 639; <span class="Italic">Ricard</span>, 529 F.2d at 216-17. It also precludes us from considering (as the administrative judge otherwise properly did) whether the appellant's service actually prevented him from timely refiling his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conroy</span>, 507 U.S. at 513-18, 113 S. Ct. at 1564-67. Based on the record now before us, then, it appears that the appellant had 60 days from June 30, 1995, in which to refile his appeal, and that he timely refiled it on August 7, 1995. Accordingly, we remand the appeal to the regional office so that the administrative judge may afford the parties the opportunity (described above) to submit more evidence regarding the duration of the appellant's service. If she then determines that the appeal was timely refiled, she shall adjudicate the appeal on the merits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner relies particularly upon 50 USC App. 521 which he claims "grant(s) a veteran additional time, after military service, to exercise his rights" in legal proceedings. That section provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At any stage thereof any action or proceeding in any <span class="Italic">court</span> in which a person in military service is involved, either as a plaintiff or defendant, during the period of such service or within sixty days thereafter may, in the discretion of the court in which it is pending, on its own motion, and shall, on application to it by such person or some person in his behalf, be stayed as provided in this Act (sections 501-548 and 560-590 of this Appendix), unless in the opinion of the <span class="Italic">court</span>, the ability of plaintiff to prosecute the action or the defendant to conduct his defense is not materially affected by reason of his military service. (Emphasis ours).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The hereinabove cited provision specifically refers to "court" proceedings. This section has been held not to apply to administrative proceedings. <span class="Italic">Polis v. Creedon,</span> 162 F.2d 908 (Emer.Ct.App. 1947). The court in that case relied upon the definition of "court" in 50 USC App. 511(4) as including "any court of competent jurisdiction of the United States or of any State, whether or not a court of record." 162 F.2d at 911. The holding in <span class="Italic">Polis</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">United States v. Frantz,</span> 220 F.2d 123 (3rd Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 349 U.S. 954, 75 S. Ct. 883, 99 L. Ed. 1278 (1955).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The authority most supportive of petitioner's position is 5 USC App. 525, quoted in the decision of the presiding official and repeated here in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The period of military service shall not be included in computing any period now or hereafter to be limited by any law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in any court, board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of government by...any person in military service...whether such cause of action or the right or privilege to institute such action or proceeding shall have accrued prior to or during the period of such service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 525 operates to toll the statute of limitations only for the period of active military service. <span class="Italic">Diamond v. United States</span>, 344 F.2d 703, 170 Ct. Cl. 166 (1965). In the instant matter, section 525 operated automatically to halt the running of the 20-day time limitation for filing the appeal until petitioner was released from active duty, i.e., until May 18, 1979. It does not operate to grant petitioner more time than is required for filing by 5 CFR 1201.22(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner was afforded ample opportunity to show good cause justifying an extension of time for filing an appeal, in a July 5, 1979 response to the agency's objection to his request for extension, and again in a July 17, 1979 communication to the Board which he termed a "supplemental response to the Agency's Motion to Dismiss Appeal as Untimely." However, the only reason petitioner presented in support of his request for an extension was the fact that he was on active military duty until May 18, 1979. Therefore, under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, 50 USC App. 525, petitioner was entitled only to a mandatory tolling of the 20-day time limitation here involved during the period of his service. The Act provided for no further extensions of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the finding of the presiding official that the period for filing under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) began to run from May 19, 1979, the day after petitioner was released from active duty, and continued to run until June 7, 1979. In order for petitioner to have received an extension beyond June 7, 1979, it was necessary for him to show "good cause" pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.12....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Neighoff v. DHS</span>, 122 MSPR 86, 89-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10, 2015 MSPB 3 (2015), noted that the serviceman or servicewoman's time to appeal runs from release from qualifying military service, not just from the end of the active duty portion of that service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The tolling provision of the SCRA provides that the "period of a servicemember's military service may not be included in computing any period limited by law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in a court, or in any board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of a State (or political subdivision of a State) or the United States by or against the servicemember or the servicemember's heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns." 50 U.S.C. app. &#x00A7; 526(a); <span class="Italic">see Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14 (2007) (applying the SCRA tolling provision to Board proceedings). The SCRA defines "military service" for National Guard members to include: "service under a call to active service authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under section 502(f) of Title 32, United States Code, for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds." 50 U.S.C. app. &#x00A7; 511(2)(A)(ii). The SCRA further defines "period of military service" as "the period beginning on the date on which a servicemember enters military service and ending on the date on which the servicemember is <span class="Italic">released</span> from military service or dies while in military service." 50 U.S.C. app. &#x00A7; 511(3) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's active duty in Afghanistan from July 1, 2013, to February 10, 2014, constitutes military service within the meaning of the SCRA and thus tolled the filing period for his Board appeal. At issue on appeal is when the appellant was released from military service, thereby terminating the SCRA's tolling provision. As discussed, the administrative judge found that the appellant was effectively released from military service when he returned from Afghanistan on February 10, 2014. We disagree. The appellant alleges that, although he returned from Afghanistan on February 10, 2014, he was undergoing out-processing and his DD-214 form shows that he was not released from active duty until April 9, 2014. According to the DD-214 form, the appellant entered active duty on July 1, 2013, was separated on April 9, 2014, and the type of separation identified is "Release from Active Duty."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the DD-214 form controlling as to the date of the appellant's release from active duty. The express purpose of a DD-214 form is to "record and report the transfer or separation of military personnel from a period of active duty" and, significantly, to also provide "[a]ppropriate governmental agencies with an authoritative source of information which they require in the administration of Federal and State laws applying to personnel who have been discharged, otherwise released, or transferred to a Reserve component while on active duty." 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 45.2(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the administrative judge erred in considering whether the appellant's military service after February 10, 2014, actually precluded him from filing his appeal. The Board has held that a showing of military service under the SCRA, and its predecessor Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, automatically tolls the filing period and the appellant "need not show that the circumstances of his military service actually impaired his ability to pursue his legal rights in a timely fashion." <span class="Italic">Henry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 555, 558 (1996); <span class="Italic">see Brown</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">see also Davis v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 246, 249-50 (1991). Accordingly, we find that the filing period was tolled for the entire duration of the appellant's active duty from July 1, 2013, to April 9, 2014, and the appellant's March 20, 2014 appeal was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of National Guard service, <span class="Italic">Bridge v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0261-I-1 (NP 1/23/2015), stated, at n.4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of 2003 (SCRA), "the period of a servicemember's military service may not be included in computing any period limited by law...for the bringing of any action or proceeding in a court...by or against the servicemember...." 50 U.S.C. app. 526(a); <span class="Italic">see Brown v.

However, only certain forms of National Guard duty toll filing deadlines under the SCRA. The SCRA defines "military service" for National Guard members to include only "service under a call to active service authorized by the President or the Secretary of Defense for a period of more than 30 consecutive days under section 502(f) of [T]itle 32, United States Code, for purposes of responding to a national emergency declared by the President and supported by Federal funds." 50 U.S.C. app. &#x00A7; 511(2)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">see</span> 50 U.S.C. app. &#x00A7; 511(2)(A)(i) (defining service for servicemembers not in the National Guard as active duty under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(d)(1)); 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(d)(1) (excluding full time National Guard duty from the definition of active duty military service). The orders submitted by the appellant <span id="Page_957"></span>indicate that his NYARNG training was for periods of less than 30 consecutive days. Thus, time that the appellant spent in annual training with the NYARNG prior to filing his petition for review would not toll the filing deadline under the SCRA.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...In addition, because the appellant was serving on active duty with the Georgia National Guard for a significant period of time between the alleged adverse action and the filing of the appeal, the timeliness determination in this case may implicate the provisions of the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act, particularly subsection 206(a) of the Act which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The period of a servicemember's military service may not be included in computing any period limited by law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in a court, or in any board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of a State (or political subdivision of a State) or the United States by or against the servicemember or the servicemember's heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...We reopen this appeal to consider the effect of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act of 2003 (SCRA) on the timeliness issue presented in this case. <span class="Italic">See Henry v.

The SCRA provides "protection...to servicemembers of the United States to enable such persons to devote their entire energy to the defense needs of the Nation," and provides for "the temporary suspension of judicial and administrative proceedings and transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of servicemembers during their military service." 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 502. The Board has applied the SCRA and its predecessor, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 (SSCRA), to Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Wyatt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 21 (2006); <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 558-59; <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 250; <span class="Italic">Stemmer v. Department of the Army,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 352, 354-55 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, the Board considered the applicability of the SSCRA for the first time on review upon finding that the "orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice." <span class="Italic">Henry,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 558-59; <span class="Italic">see Davis</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 249 (reopening the appeal to consider the appellant's new argument on the application of the SSCRA to the appeal). Similarly, we find that the appellant's assertions on review of his military duty obligations warrant our consideration of the SCRA's effect on the timeliness of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SCRA applies to active duty servicemembers as well as to reserve members of the uniformed services who are "ordered to report for military service." 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 516(a). The SCRA provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The period of a servicemember's military service may not be included in computing any period limited by law, regulation, or order for the bringing of any action or proceeding in a court, or in any board, bureau, commission, department, or other agency of a State (or political subdivision of a State) or the United States by or against the servicemember or the servicemember's heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 526(a); <span class="Italic">see Wyatt</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 21. The Board has held that the tolling provision "operate[s] automatically to halt the running of the...time limitation for filing [an] appeal until" an appellant is "released from active [military] duty...." <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 249-50 (quoting <span class="Italic">Stemmer</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 355). The SCRA defines "military service" in the case of a servicemember as "active duty, as defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States Code." 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 511(2)(A)(i). In turn, title 10 defines "active duty" as "full-time duty in the active military service of the United States" and includes "full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(d)(1). In previous cases where the Board has applied the tolling provision of the SCRA or the SSCRA, the appellants had been recalled to active duty. <span class="Italic">See Wyatt</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 21 (the appellant served on active duty with the Georgia National Guard); <span class="Italic">Henry</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 557, 559 (the appellant was recalled to active duty for a period of 10 months); <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 247, 250 (the appellant served on active duty as an Air Force reservist); <span class="Italic">Stemmer</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 353, 355 (the appellant served on active military duty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the SCRA's definition of "military service" and the mandatory tolling provision of the SCRA, we must determine whether the appellant's claimed military duty during the period of October 2-15, 2006, constitutes "military service" covered by the SCRA. The status of the appellant's military duty during this period of time is essential for tolling purposes because it determines whether his appeal following the issuance of the agency's September 29, 2006 FAD, which the agency asserts was received by the appellant on October 5, 2006, was timely filed. If all of the appellant's claimed military duty from October 2-15, 2006, constitutes "military service" as defined by the SCRA, then the deadline for filing his appeal to the Board would be November 15, 2006 (30 days after he returned from military duty on October 16, 2006). Therefore, the appellant's November 15, 2006 appeal would be timely filed. However, if any portion of the appellant's claimed October 2-15, 2006 period of military duty does not constitute "military service" under the SCRA, then the period of time to file his appeal would not be tolled long enough to cause his November 15, 2006 appeal to be timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon reviewing the evidence submitted by the appellant on review, we are unable to determine the status of the appellant's claimed military duty for October 2-14, 2006. The subject line of the appellant's orders to report for military duty with the Navy for October 2-14, 2006, merely states "Ordered to ADT-NP." The orders do not define this acronym or contain any other conclusive indication of his duty status. The appellant also submits a notice by the Navy that the appellant claims documents that he was ordered to report for duty for October 14-15, 2006. The appellant's claimed military duty for October 14-15, 2006, appears to be "inactive-duty training,"[2] although the evidence for this period of duty is also insufficient for the Board to make a conclusive finding. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An accurate determination of the appellant's duty status for these periods of military duty is critical given the specific definition of "military service" in the SCRA. The fact that "inactive-duty training" is defined separately from "active duty" in title 10 and is not otherwise referenced in or by the SCRA makes it likely that it does not constitute "military service" under the SCRA.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(d)(1), (d)(7); 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 511.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(d)(7), the term "inactive-duty training" means:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;duty prescribed for Reserves by the Secretary concerned under section 206 of title 37 or any other provision of law; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;special additional duties authorized for Reserves by an authority designated by the Secretary concerned and performed by them on a voluntary basis in connection with the prescribed training or maintenance activities of the units to which they are assigned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Such term includes those duties when performed by Reserves in their status as members of the National Guard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that at least one court has determined under the former SSCRA that regular, weekend reserve duty did not qualify as "active duty" within the meaning of the SSCRA's tolling provision. <span class="Italic">Min v. Avila</span>, 991 S.W.2d 495, 506-07 (Tex. App. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, because the record is not sufficient for the Board to determine whether the appellant's claimed military duty from October 2-15, 2006, was "military service" under the SCRA, and because the agency has not had an opportunity to respond to the appellant's assertions and evidence regarding his military duty, we remand this case to the Dallas Regional Office for further proceedings regarding the timeliness issue presented in this appeal. On remand, the AJ shall allow the agency an opportunity to respond to the appellant's assertions and evidence regarding his claimed military duty and shall allow the appellant an additional opportunity to submit evidence and argument regarding the nature of his military duty during the period of October 2-15, 2006. If the administrative judge determines that any or all of the appellant's military duty between October 2-15, 2006, constituted "military service" under the SCRA, then the administrative judge must exempt the appropriate days of military service from the period of time afforded the appellant to file his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Henry</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 558-59; <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 250. Further, if the administrative judge finds that the appellant's military duty is not partially or wholly covered by the SCRA to cause his appeal to be timely filed, the administrative judge shall consider whether the appellant's military duty nevertheless constitutes good cause for the delay of his untimely filed appeal. <span class="Italic">See Hamner v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 84, &#x00B6; 9 (2002); <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184; <span class="Italic">Stemmer</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 355. Because the appellant has requested a hearing in his appeal, if the administrative judge determines that there is a dispute of material facts relating to timeliness, then the appellant is entitled to a hearing on timeliness. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sims v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 311, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). If the administrative judge finds that the appeal was timely filed or that good cause is shown for the untimely filing to warrant a waiver of the filing deadline, then the administrative judge shall determine whether the Board has adverse action jurisdiction over the appellant's removal appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_958"></span>Additionally, the administrative judge shall determine whether the appellant, who did not submit any evidence or argument in response to the AJ's December 12, 2006 show-cause order on the questions of jurisdiction and timeliness, was effectively prevented from adequately participating in the proceedings below due to his recall to active duty military service with the U.S. Navy. Specifically, the appellant has also submitted additional military orders on review that show that he was recalled to active duty by the Navy in support of Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom, and reported for duty on November 17, 2006. These military orders do not include a date for the appellant's release from active duty. The Board recognizes that the SCRA permits an administrative agency of the United States upon its own motion, or upon application by a servicemember, to issue a stay of administrative proceedings when the servicemember is unable to participate in the proceedings due to military service obligations. 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 511(5), 512(b), 522. Therefore, on remand in this appeal, the administrative judge shall determine whether the appellant continues to serve on extended active duty military service, and if so, whether the mandatory conditions of the SCRA are satisfied to warrant a stay of proceedings in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 50 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 522(b)(2).</p>
