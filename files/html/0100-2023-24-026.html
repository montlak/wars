<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard form acknowledgement orders that the administrative judge issued to the petitioners specifically stated that within 15 days they were to submit evidence of good cause sufficient to excuse the untimely nature of their appeals, and that the record on that issue would close in 25 days. The petitioners have not argued that any of the additional evidence they offered to the full Board was new evidence that was unavailable to them at the time of the proceedings before the administrative judge. Nor have they argued that they were unable to comply with the time limits specified in the acknowledgement orders. Indeed, each petitioner filed a written argument addressed to the issues of timeliness and involuntariness, and one of the petitioners--Shechtman--submitted evidence, although that evidence did not suggest that he had advised the Postal Service that he regarded his retirement as involuntary. The administrative judge was therefore fully justified in adjudicating the good cause issue based on the evidence and argument submitted within the time limits set forth in the acknowledgement order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cheguina v.

<p class="Body-Text">There is a limited exception to the rule that evidence not presented below cannot be considered on appeal. Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, noted but not otherwise discussed in <span class="Italic">McGarigle v. USPS</span>, 904 F.2d 687, 689 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1990), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Omissions From or Misstatements in the Record</span>. The parties may at any time, by stipulation, supply any omission from the record or correct a misstatement, or the court may so direct. If necessary, the court may direct that a supplemental record be prepared and filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because the court will consider only the record before the Board, it is important to understand what that record comprises and how portions of it are placed before the circuit court. After a petition for review has been filed, the Clerk of the Board will file with the Clerk of the Court a certified index of the administrative record. The Board does not file the administrative record, just an index. The index contains an itemized listing of all the components of the record established before the MSPB, from the appeal to the final decision. A copy of the complete record will not be required in most cases; it should already be part of the case file of counsel or client. The Board will, however, produce for counsel a complete copy of the record through a contract arrangement with a commercial photocopying establishment for the cost of the copying. The Board, if electronic filings were used in the appeal, may copy the electronic file components onto a disk and send it to the requesting party. Portions of the record may be ordered through the Board's Office of the Clerk. [Refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-104.html#sec3-104">Right to and Necessity for a Record or Transcript</a>," and to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-110.html#sec3-110">Use of Recording</a>," discussing the procedure for obtaining a transcript or copies of the Board's hearing tapes.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Arbitrators are also supposed to file a statement of the contents of the record (also known as a certified index to the record) under Circuit Rule 17(a). Arbitrators may need some persuasion, for they are not paid for the time they spend compiling an index of the record; however, most of them cooperate (especially if counsel prepares the index for the arbitrator). An arbitrator need not make his notes a part of the official record. <span class="Italic">Nicholson and AFGE Local 2663 v. VAMC Kansas City</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3151). If the arbitrator does not make a certified index available to the court, the court may direct that the parties stipulate to the record or file an agreed statement of facts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rubert v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3610). <span class="Italic">Welch v. VA</span>, 226 Fed. Appx. 982, 987 n.* (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), noted the difficulty presented when the court is called on to review findings of an arbitrator when no transcript of the hearing was made and when, following the hearing by the arbitrator, the arbitrator destroyed both the hearing exhibits and the notes he took during the hearing. The court noted that "the better course is for the hearing record to be maintained intact until the appellate process is completed."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal depends on portions of testimony, it may be necessary to obtain a written transcript. The transcript is not, however, technically essential to an appeal. The court commented on the need for a transcript in an appeal to the court in <span class="Italic">Turks v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3536):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government asserts that because Mr. Turks has not provided this court with a transcript of the hearing, "he cannot now challenge the presiding official's findings of fact and the presiding official's... factual determinations should be accorded finality." No authority is cited for this restraint on an appellant. Mr. Turks' statutory burden may be harder to meet without a transcript, but his right to challenge the factual determinations is established by law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Yet the Federal Circuit may expect that portions of a record be presented for adjudication of an appeal, <span class="Italic">Turner v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3268):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition to this court, Mr. Turner contests several factual findings of the administrative judge. However, Mr. Turner has not furnished a copy of the relevant portions of the Board hearing. Under Rule 10(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and Rule 11 of this court, Mr. Turner <span id="Page_5188"></span>must include in the record a transcript of the portion of the hearing upon which his contentions rely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gonzales v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DLA</span>, 772 F.2d 887, 890-91 (Fed. Cir. 1985), approved of the Board's procedures concerning production (or nonproduction) of transcripts and added as to use of a transcript in a judicial appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner did not furnish a written transcript to the board with his application for review nor has he done so to the court on this appeal. He says he could not afford it. This becomes significant because if petitioner wishes to rely on any part of the record of the hearing he is required to provide it to us under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 10(b) and local Rule 11. Petitioner has not sought production of a written transcript by relying on the provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1915 (1982), by bringing the appeal in <span class="Italic">forma pauperis</span>, which might have satisfied both the board and the court of the good cause and extenuating circumstances which would result in production at the government's expense. 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.53. We think that the regulation is entirely reasonable and lawful. The fault here is with petitioner who did not raise below the issue of the lack of a typewritten transcript. This, in addition to the reasons stated, justifies our not considering his argument now. <span class="Italic">See James v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,</span> 755 F.2d 154 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Waller does not identify the witnesses he alleges were improperly excluded from the hearing or state how his inability to call these witnesses specifically hindered the prosecution of his appeal. Moreover, Mr. Waller fails to provide any citation to the record, including the hearing transcript, in support of his argument. We are unable to find an abuse of discretion by the Board where an appellant raises issues that are factually dependent yet fails to provide specific reference to the pertinent section of the record. This argument therefore fails.</p>
